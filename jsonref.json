Rijneveld’s response to this early confrontation with the unthinkable was not to draw a veil over it, but to build two books around it. “I think it’s unfortunate for a family to have a writer born into it,” says the 28-year-old author, serenely.In the devoutly religious rural community among which the Rijneveld family still live, the exposure was sudden and extreme. When Calf’s Caul, a poetry collection, was published in 2015, its young author was heralded in the national media as a new star of Dutch literature. More challenging still for the family was the novel that arrived three years later, De avond is ongemak, which appears in English this week as The Discomfort of Evening (Faber, translated by Michelle Hutchison), and has just been longlisted for the International Booker prize. “All the shopkeepers and the hairdresser were talking about it, but my family are too frightened to read it,” says Rijneveld, who uses the pronouns theythem.In The Discomfort of Evening, Matthies dies in a skating accident, leaving his 10-year-old sister Jas fantasising about how to prevent the family from being destroyed in the aftermath. She keeps two toads in a box under her bed, thinking that if they can be persuaded to mate, her parents might too, and everything will be all right again. Meanwhile, left to cope with the emotional turbulence of adolescence without adult support, she plays games with her surviving brother and sister that become increasingly wild and dangerous.The novel is set over the two years in Jas’s life when hormones corral children into adult sexual identities. Rijneveld resists such categorisation, self‑describing not as trans but as “in between”. “As a small child I felt I was a boy, I dressed like a boy and behaved like a boy, but children at that age are still neutral in their gender. In adolescence, when the separation became clear, I dressed like a girl and became a girl, then at 20 I went back to the boy I was at primary school.” Their middle name, Lucas, comes from an imaginary boyfriend they had as a young child. Elegantly dressed in trademark suit and braces, Rijneveld’s composure only breaks when they struggle to remember the name of the film star they aspire to be. It finally emerges in a burst of giggles: “Timothée Chalamet, star of Call Me by Your Name – I want to be a beautiful boy.”They have not yet decided whether to take hormone treatment, so when they read their work publicly it is in an unbroken voice, radiating an androgynous charm that has made them one of the poetry circuit’s rare breakout stars. “What a sweetheart,” wrote a commenter in response to a Dutch TV chatshow on the environment, in which Rijneveld signed up to the David Attenborough fan club, urged listeners to heed his warnings about the climate emergency and reported that they had never flown in a plane.Only their hands betray their other life as a one-day-a-week dairy farmer, with scrubbed nails that are bitten to the quick. “Farming keeps me grounded. The cows are my best friends I like cleaning out the stables and shovelling the shit.”This unglamorous side of farming slops through both the novel and the poems. Jas’s mother doses her children with worm medicine and slathers them with udder ointment to protect against the cold. One of the poems in Calf’s Caul is titled “Lice Mothers”. “People from the city get scared of these things that villagers think of as normal.” For example? “For example, torturing frogs – it’s not very nice but it happens and children will experiment with it.”Despite being published three years apart, the novel and poetry collection began in tandem, even sharing some lines. “The challenge was how to write them when I didn’t have many memories of my brother’s death. So I started with Matthies, and only during the writing arrived at the shape the novel has now. I saw Calf’s Caul as preparation for writing The Discomfort of Evening.”The collection, which has yet to be published in English, is full of the anxieties that Rijneveld’s chosen identity has created in a family who are god-fearing members of the Reformed church. “Papa has been searching for a daughter for years,” reads one poem. “It’s difficult for my parents to understand that I’m not the girl that they raised,” Rijneveld says. “It’s not in the Bible.”Whether the papa of the poems is any more Rijneveld’s own father than Jas’s papa in the novel is left open by a writer who admits that they regard their public identity as a performance, to be donned along with the braces. “Writing is playing with who you are. Being an author makes me feel more confident.”Rijneveld was born on 20 April 1991 on a farm in the north Brabant, a province in the south of the Netherlands. The date is significant, they disarmingly disclose, because it means they share a birthday with Adolf Hitler. “As a child I thought it was a funny idea to be born on the same day as such a monstrous man, but it made me wonder if I was a good or a bad person.” In the novel, Jas builds a fantasy about a Jewish family her mother has hidden away in the basement. She acts out her social alienation by making a Nazi salute at school and cracking a joke which was judged too offensive for the English edition of the novel.It’s part of a strand of black humour that is as dangerous in its way as the children’s games (one gruesome scene involves a dummy cow and an insemination gun). Asked why the novel pushes so hard at boundaries of what is acceptable, the author shrugs: “It is related by a child and children are naive. They say these things. They don’t know any better, so they can get away with an innocent joke.”At nine years old, Rijneveld says, “I had a very strong belief in God and was convinced he was living in the attic.” The novel is full of glimpses into what it was like growing up in a strict religious household. Jas’s father restricts their TV channels for fear of nudity, which he pronounces “as if a fruit fly had just flown into his mouth – he spat as he said it” her mother daringly watches a quiz show involving words that are not in the Bible. “She called them ‘blush words’ because some of them made your cheeks turn red.” When her children try out these words, she attempts “to wash them out of our mouths with a bar of green soap, like the grease stains from our good school clothes”.Of their own experience Rijneveld simply says: “Behind the book is such a strong force. After leaving school I didn’t know what to do. I started living in a room in a new city and I just knew I had to write it. In daily life it’s hard to be as strong as I am behind my laptop.” They now live in Utrecht, and work on a farm that is not their parents’.There are only two responses to the death of a child, Rijneveld says: either it draws a family closer or rips them apart. So what happened in their own family? “I have to think about the answer to that … ” Rijneveld says solemnly. “No, it hasn’t torn us apart, but all the relationships changed.” One brother and sister are now teachers, and a second brother is in the police. None of them has read the novel. “I hope that my parents will read it one day and be proud that they will understand it’s a novel, it’s not all about them. But it is probably too soon.”Meanwhile Rijneveld’s writing has gained them a new cultural family, which stretches beyond the Netherlands to Italy and Germany. Calf’s Caul has gone through 11 editions to date in Dutch while The Discomfort of Evening has sold 55,000 copies in the Netherlands it will be published in French in April and is currently being translated into Spanish, Korean, Chinese and Arabic. A second poetry collection is already out, and Rijneveld is working on a second novel. All of which bears out their fervent belief that “there’s always light in darkness, just as there’s always humour in gruesomeness. It’s just the way things work. There must always be something to laugh about.” Claire Armitstead• Marieke Lucas Rijneveld’s The Discomfort of Evening, translated by Michelle Hutchison, is published by Faber in the UK and out now.As a young man travelling around Europe in the late 1990s, the Malmö-based writer Andrzej Tichý remembers telling friends about the conditions endured by marginalised groups in Sweden. “And they just would not believe me,” he recalls. “From the outside Sweden was this harmonious, social democratic paradise and people preferred to believe the folk hymn that here was a society that looked after everyone. But it was never actually true.” He cites historic state-sanctioned forced sterilisations of those deemed to be mentally or physically impaired, and discrimination against Jews, Roma and indigenous peoples. “And there has always been the day-to-day treatment of the poor and of immigrants, let alone the junkies and criminals,” he adds. “Of course there were places in the world that were worse, but Sweden was never perfect.”The poor and the immigrants, the junkies and the criminals, loom large in Tichý’s prize-winning novel Wretchedness (Eländet, translated by Nichola Smalley) which will be published in the UK in June by And Other Stories. It is his fifth novel, but the first to appear in English, and opens with a cellist on his way to a classical concert being asked for money by a drug addict on the street. The encounter summons a swirling sequence of flashbacks from the cellist’s own chaotic past. Graphic depictions of crime, racism, poverty, drug use and violence are rendered through paragraph-free slabs of text that propulsively veer between voices and minds, times and locations: “Suddenly my mouth is full of it again,” the musician declares, “of names and places, of events and movements, of memories and images.” The inescapable realisation is how easy it would have been for him to have become that junkie.Tichý was born in Prague in 1978 to a Czech father and Polish mother. His family moved to Sweden when he was three, and he was brought up on a Malmö housing estate with a large migrant population not unlike the one featured in Wretchedness. “I’m not interested in autobiography or autofiction, but I know there are always borderline areas between the writer and the subject and I am not a stranger to many of the things in the novel. Much comes from personal experience, although sometimes indirectly.”As well as the Swedish estates, the novel draws on Tichý’s experiences of living in Hamburg and London to paint a picture of a pan-European community of the excluded passing through squats, underground clubs, petty scams and cash-only employment.This internationalism is also reflected in the language he deploys. “A lot of it is written in a sort of slang encompassing many different languages. Some words have long been incorporated into standard Swedish, from Roma for example. But now there are also a lot of Arab words, Serbo-Croat, Polish, Spanish, Albanian. It’s all mixed together, but interestingly while one sentence can contain several different languages, people will know what you mean.”Tichý’s early creative life centered on music – playing guitar in the hardcore scene rather than classical cello – which led to him starting up fanzines for which he first wrote poetry and then prose. There is a sense of musicality inherent in the dense text of Wretchedness, as episodes from the composer’s past repeatedly return, with references ranging from Snoop Dogg and Mobb Deep’s hip-hop to the concert hall avant garde of Julius Eastman and Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi’s atonal drones. (There is a coolly eclectic Spotify playlist that accompanies the book).Literary and philosophical influences include Simone Weil and Thomas Bernhard, and Tichý admits that his is a potentially demanding kind of literature. “I sometimes go out and talk to young people on the estates, people not really interested in books, and some of them find it hard. But they are interested in the themes, which is partly why rap lyrics have always been a huge influence on me. They can be complex and sophisticated yet can describe street stuff in a wonderfully direct and concise manner and so make art out of what is thought of as low life.“That is partly my project too. I’ve always wanted to depict lives and environments under-explored by literature. These lives not only deserve to be chronicled, they deserve to be elevated.” Nicholas Wroe• Andrzej Tichy’s Wretchedness, translated by Nichola Smalley, will be published by And Other Stories in the UK in June.It is no longer the curse of the Irish author to be compared to James Joyce: these days, if they happen to be sharp, socially conscious and writing about twentysomethings living now, they will be announced as the new Sally Rooney, and also as some kind of child prodigy, even when they are well into their 20s. Naoise Dolan, 27, finds this all hilarious. “In any other career, it is completely normal to get going in your 20s – we’ve just normalised the desperate state of affairs around writing,” she says. “And the idea that young women couldn’t ever have had an emotional or interesting life, or that it’s somehow cringeworthy to capture the present moment – both are ridiculous to me.”Despite the inevitable comparisons, Dolan’s debut, Exciting Times, published in April by Weidenfeld, is more caustic and cynical than Rooney’s writing, if just as clever. It follows Ava, a 22-year-old who had “been sad in Dublin, decided it was Dublin’s fault and thought Hong Kong would help”. There she meets 29-year-old banker Julian, an only child who went to Eton. (“These were the two least surprising facts anyone had ever told me about themselves,” Ava notes.) Their relationship is sexual, if carefully ambiguous, and is built mostly on their mutual enjoyment of acidic banter over any deeply-felt romance. Ava admires Julian’s cushions and willingness to give her his credit cards his highest praise for her is that she is “good company”: “Really it was amusing that we were having sex,” Ava muses. “He was attractive and confident, whereas I was willing to centre my emotional life around someone who treated me like a favoured armrest.” When Julian temporarily moves away, Ava meets Edith, a young and wealthy Hong Kong lawyer. It is here that Dolan’s novel feels most contemporaneous all the fretting over love and class could be compared to Austen or Wharton, but her light treatment of bisexuality and polyamory is utterly 2020. Ava, Julian and Edith are never really a love triangle but a hinge, with Ava in the middle of two people who benignly tolerate each other. The only drama in their arrangement lies in the choice Ava feels she must make, despite Julian’s indifference and Edith saying things like: “I have many opinions about the nexus between monogamy and patriarchy, opinions which are available on request should they interest you.”Dolan is less interested in sexuality than in relationships: “Sexuality only affects the ability to be attracted to someone – how that manifests is more about who that person is. As a queer person, I have no understanding how it might feel different to experience heterosexual attraction, though I’m quite interested in that. But there are plenty of novels about straight people already. And I think it is more interesting to write about relationships without the assumption that it has to be a monogamous one.” She suspects older readers will be baffled by the dynamic. “There is this expectation that you should write to people who are powerful in ways that you’re not, to explain to them why you’re different. I think it’s better to just throw it out there and if they don’t like it, fine. For people my age, the most important question is: are you treating your partners well or poorly?” When in conversation with older writers, she says, “I sometimes feel like I’m trying to prove that it’s OK to write stories about people who aren’t them. It’s not a gendered thing, there is a class element too. A lot of things that we call ‘the millennial experience’ were always part of a universal experience for some social groups – middle-class people are just upset that those things are happening to them now.”Dolan grew up in Dublin, studied English at Trinity College and was published in Stinging Fly magazine – by Rooney, who was editor until 2019. (This makes Dolan “such an Irish cliche”, she says.) She was always interested in literature, but never had any aspirations to write – “firstly because it’s not financially possible for most people, and secondly, I don’t stake a significant amount of my self-image in how I relate to the modes of production. It was a hobby, not a career goal. I have a limited amount of patience for the writer-as-personality thing – it is a very mechanical and somewhat distant thing for me. I just make things up. I don’t relate to accounts that people give of being struck by ideas or their characters taking over. Writing was always just kind of something that I plugged away at.”Dolan, who is autistic, “doesn’t like talking to people”, so to get away from colleagues and students at her teaching job, she spent five months hiding in coffeeshops on her lunch breaks. “I find it easier to relate to people by thinking about why they are the way they are. I aim to observe people rather than empathise with them,” she says. And her observations are brilliant, often simultaneously comic and bleak. “Julian often reminded me to eat. It made him feel better about liking that I was thin,” Ava notes. Or, at a party: “Ralph’s girlfriend Victoria was good at wearing clothes. She was so beautiful I couldn’t see why she was talking to me. Sometimes her eyes said: I don’t know why, either.”With the emergence of Rooney, Eimear McBride, Lisa McInerney, Nicole Flattery and others, Ireland has been held up for its almost mythic ability to cultivate brilliant women writers – but Dolan puts this down to Ireland being a more egalitarian playing field than the UK. “Ireland isn’t perfect, but we still have relatively good support for the arts so literary writing doesn’t have as much of a bourgeois connotation as it does in the UK. We have a better range of writers here. UK journalists always ask the oddest questions, like, ‘have you had a job before?’ I’m a normal person – yes I have.”Dolan stopped travelling by plane in September, after the fires in the Amazon moved her to reconsider her impact on the environment. “It might hold me back from promoting the book, but to be pumping all that CO2 into the air to push a novel just seems like such a ridiculous thing. If my novel doesn’t get promoted, someone else’s will. The literary world will be much unaffected.” Her decision, she thinks, comes back to her feelings about being a novelist. “I don’t think that I’m a special person who has an innate entitlement to exist writing novels while demanding other people do less pleasant things with their time. I’m lucky to, but there are a lot of things that I’m not willing to do to keep that situation going. Flying is just one of them.” Sian Cain• Naoise Dolan’s Exciting Times is published by Orion in the UK in April.“The thing I write best,” Hassan Blasim says, “is violence.” His acclaimed short-story collections, The Madman of Freedom Square and The Iraqi Christ, are fervent, unblinking depictions of post-invasion Iraq, the country of his birth, though their violence is focused through the lenses of surrealism, humour and poignancy. The former was longlisted for the Independent foreign fiction prize in 2010, and the latter won it in 2014, becoming the first title translated from Arabic to do so.In 2000, Blasim left Iraq, where he had been persecuted for his film-making and where his writing is still banned. He spent four years walking illegally across Europe, eventually settling in Finland. His debut novel, God 99 (translated by Jonathan Wright and published in July by Comma), draws on his experience: its protagonist (called Hassan) is an Iraqi refugee attempting to establish himself as a writer in Finland. But he stresses that “the book puts reality and fiction in dialogue. Autobiography is a fiction – we lie about things we misremember and misrepresent. So too fiction has truths. Luckily, I’m not famous enough for people to know my life, so I can still play with it.”God 99, he says, is “born of dialogue – always in conversation are death and life, war and peace”. In the novel, Hassan traverses Europe and interviews 99 refugees, examining the effect of war on their lives, and their impact on the countries they make home.Blasim is ambivalent about the label “European writer” – more ambivalent than he is about “debut novelist”, which he flatly rejects (“I just write. This shift to long-form is not important”). In his mind, his identity is simply “writer”. “In England,” he says, “and other parts of western and southern Europe, you have a history with immigrants. In Finland, it’s relatively new, and while some people embrace me as a Finnish writer, others resist.” Because he writes in Arabic, he is ineligible for Finnish literary prizes, and cannot join the Union of Writers.This context, combined with censorship of his work in the Middle East, means translation into English has been vital. But although Blasim attributes his success to translation, he stresses that it was never something he sought: “When I came to Europe, I didn’t know where to go. I had this romantic idea of reaching France, because of the literature. But you just go wherever you can. How can you think about the future, when life is like this? How can you think about succeeding as a writer? About reaching English-language readers?”Translating Blasim’s work – which is as experimental linguistically as it is formally – is no light task. The Arabic of God 99 is what Blasim calls “street Arabic”, and it’s another reason he’s reviled by some in Iraq: “They call me a ‘dirty writer’ – they say that I do not respect the language. Nobody can touch classical Arabic because it is a holy language. But nobody uses holy language on the street. And when I dream it is not in classical Arabic.”Does he still feel at risk? “Of course,” he says. He has returned to Iraq only once, secretly, and does not believe he will again. But his new home in Finland is not one of undiluted Scandinavian peace he is working on a project about the Finnish far right, and confides that he fears for his safety if he publishes it. “Maybe I’ll meet you in England, a refugee again,” he says. “As a refugee, you are always between two fires. Your first home, and your new one.” Will Forrester• Hassan Blasim’s God 99, translated by Jonathan Wright, will be published by Comma Press in July.A Russian writer of Armenian origin, Narine Abgaryan is already renowned as a children’s author and blogger in Russia. Her novel Three Apples Fell from the Sky has sold more than 160,000 copies since it was first published in 2015 and won Russia’s most prestigious literary award, the Yasnaya Polyana prize (founded by the Tolstoy estate). A magical realist story of friendship and feuds, published in English this month by Oneworld, the book is set in the remote Armenian mountain village of Maran, where the villagers pick mulberries and make baklava. An ancient telegraph wire and a perilous mountain path that even goats struggle to follow is their only connection to the outside world. Abgaryan cites One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez, set in the isolated fictional village of Macondo, as her favourite book. But she was haunted by the ending of Márquez’s multi-generational saga of the Buendía family, as all traces of Macondo’s existence are wiped away. In Three Apples Fell from the Sky (translated by Lisa C Hayden), she resolved to write a fable that did exactly the opposite. “I wanted to write a story that ends on a note of hope,” she says. “Humanity is in dire need of hope, of kind stories.”“We live such fast-paced lives, barely managing to speak to one another, to ask how things are going,” she says. “The thing that bothers me is how young people are leaving their elders behind.” Abgaryan, who now lives in Moscow, points to how the villagers in her novel spend their days “cultivating wine that nobody wants or needs”. “Globalisation has benefits, of course, but also negative side-effects, when national customs, the things which define people, are taken away.”Her work has already been translated into 12 languages, and with English being the 13th, she now calls this her lucky number. “When you’re published in English there’s a greater chance that your work will resonate more widely,” she says. “When your work is translated, you start to work with greater joy and hope. You start to believe in yourself more.” Jade Cuttle• Narine Abgaryan’s Three Apples Fell from the Sky, translated by Lisa C Hayden, is published by Oneworld and is out now.Pauline Delabroy-Allard’s first novel took the French literary world by surprise. She wrote it to get the story out of her head and then stuck it in a drawer. “I didn’t expect anyone would want to publish it.” A few months later, with her 30th birthday approaching, she decided she had nothing to lose by posting the manuscript to a few French publishers. “I told myself I would get a load of rejection letters and then I could stop dreaming and get on with my life.” When publishers began calling the following week, “I thought someone was playing a joke”. Delabroy-Allard eventually chose Les Éditions de Minuit, whose catalogue includes the writers she most admires, including Annie Ernaux and Marguerite Duras. “I signed the contract on my 30th birthday. That was a real party.”Ça raconte Sarah (All About Sarah) won a literary award even before it was published in 2018 to almost unanimous praise. The book was shortlisted for a the Prix Goncourt, the most prestigious literary award in France. Translated into English by Adriana Hunter and published this month by Harvill Secker, it is a story of desire and desolation. Its narrator is a bored secondary school teacher and single mother in Paris whose comfortable but humdrum life is upended when she falls in love with Sarah, a professional musician, who is loud and impetuous.The narrator and Sarah embark on an all-consuming, passionate relationship. The first part of the novel concludes when they separate and Sarah reveals she has breast cancer. In the second part, the narrator flees Sarah’s apartment, telling nobody and leaving her child behind. It is unclear whether Sarah has died or dumped the unnamed narrator, who descends into despair.Like the book’s narrator, Delabroy-Allard is a teacher, has a daughter and is in a relationship with a professional violinist called Sarah. But that is where the similarities end, she insists. “I’m not bothered if people think it’s me, but it isn’t. I find it difficult to invent things from nothing, so I use reality as a base. Once I have that base I can create the rest.”She says she left Paris to live in isolation in the countryside to complete the second part of the novel. “It was very hard being in her head – almost physically painful. I was happy to finish it.” She is now working on a second novel that she is racing to complete before she and her pregnant partner have a baby in July. The 31-year-old says she wanted to write about a passionate relationship between two women because there are so few “lesbian novels”. “But really this is a portrait of one woman, because everything we know of Sarah is through the narrator and in the second part there is no Sarah.”The novel ends leaving readers in limbo. “Several editors wanted me to rewrite it, but I didn’t want to change it. Everyone is free to imagine their own ending.” Kim Willsher• Pauline Delabroy-Allard’s All About Sarah, translated by Adriana Hunter, is published by Harvill Secker on 12 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b015c84bf940bccb270500d1df39df632727c071/3_203_4433_2660/master/4433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f53549ef7f0af8bf26dd46b56c7edab0","title":"oil price to plunge as much as 20 as saudis vow to step up production","story":"Move follows Russian refusal to join Opec-led production cut aimed at keeping prices highSaudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, will step up crude oil production from next month, flooding global markets and most likely depressing petrol and diesel prices, in response to Russia’s refusal to join an Opec plan to cut supplies.State oil giant Aramco will boost its crude output significantly above 10m barrels per day (bpd) in April, after a previous agreement to limit supplies agreed by Opec and Russia expires at the end of March.On Saturday, Aramco slashed its official selling price for April for all its crude grades to all destinations.Higher production and price cuts by Aramco are likely to push world prices down further, hurting countries that rely on oil exports for tax income and foreign exchange, especially in Africa, south-east Asia and South America.The new strategy adopted by Riyadh appears to target Russia and US shale oil firms, many of which are known to have high production costs and lose money when crude prices fall below $50 a barrel for more than a few months.Other Opec producers, such as Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, are expected to follow Saudi Arabia’s lead with price cuts and increased production from April.The Saudi decision came after marathon talks at the Opec headquarters in Vienna, when the Russian energy minister, Alexander Novak, said that from 1 April neither Opec nor non-Opec countries had any restrictions on production.The sources said April’s production would be significantly higher than 10m bpd, possibly closer to 11m bpd.

However, the  previously reported it had earmarked $55m to improve governance in the oil and gas sector in Guyana.ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, announced in December it had started production off Guyana’s coast, less than five years after oil was first discovered there. At the end of January, ExxonMobil increased its estimates of the size of the discovery to 8bn barrels of oil equivalent.

Where is the Daily Mail exposé condemning this disgraceful burden on society?But the columnist Sarah Vine, a cess-gargling Barbamama made entirely out of cess, whose Daily Mail cess fountains vacillate from the foulest acrid cruelty to headily perfumed sentimentality, has declared that we must now be “kind”.

Remember him? Thought not.Last year, Turds adopted a Welsh rescue dog and spirited it away thoughtlessly, with his intended fiancee, to a grey world of stone and steel where it did not even speak the language. Dominic Cumming, who presumably suggested both the proposed marriage and the de facto dognapping, had calculated that the jack russell’s cute antics could single-pawedly detoxify Turds’ brand in the runup to the election. And on the day that a compliant Dilyn urinated against a carefully placed sculpture of loudmouthed David Lammy, pollsters reported a massive bounce in Tory support. Dilyn was made to wear a dog’s coat depicting a union flag, always a winner with the public, who presumably assumed the dog had bought the garment himself with his own funds, and chosen to wear it as an act of support for his master, rather than simply having been stuffed into it against his will by the cruel finger of Cumming.When the true history of Brexit, and its role in enabling a calculated far-right coup, is revealed it is unlikely that Dilyn will be spared his share of the blame, and the weak dog will rightly be held to account for normalising the corrupt campaign’s public face. If Dilyn is clever enough to choose his own racist clothing, then surely he can be tried in the courts, following the final overthrow of Cumming’s fascist cabal, and sentenced accordingly, along with Cumming’s own personal lapdog, Laura Kuenssberg.Peak Dilyn dog was last December and the compliant creature’s appearances and press opportunities have faded this year. Cumming knows the electorate hunger for new novelties and the shelf life of a Welsh dog is short. Insiders say Cumming set Turds a rigorous schedule of carefully timed procreative activity as long ago as last summer, so that the next dead cat distraction could arrive on time. And I can verify this. Because last October I found myself, standing next to DJ Paul, both of us sweating into our Dick Dastardly masks, as we spun our sexy sounds in a dimly lit Westminster bedroom.Serge Gainsbourg’s Je t’aime segued into Man’s rare 1969 debut Erotica as Cumming lurked behind us, wearing just tennis shorts and a baseball cap, shouting instructions towards the bed through a rowing cox’s megaphone. Suddenly he became furiously convinced that our selections were not doing the trick and tore Jacqueline Taïeb’s breathless 1967 yé-yé stomp Sept heures du matin from the turntable, crying: “For God’s sake boys. This is sex music!” Replacing the record with his own worn copy of the J Geils Band’s 1981 hit Centrefold, Cumming danced round the pre-marital bed bellowing exhortations through his megaphone and singing along: “My blood runs cold! My memory has just been sold!” We made our excuses and left.But Cumming’s efforts paid off and Turds has already announced paternity leave, though how the country will cope without his famously hands-on style of leadership is anyone’s guess. Floodwaters rise. Viruses throb in cracks. Far-right racists return from Russian meetings. Rights erode and advisers resign. A baby! Look!!

It concludes that free school meals make a valuable contribution to tackling Britain’s childhood obesity crisis.The pair looked at body mass index (BMI) data for 16,000 children in primary schools to examine the impact of the nutritionally balanced, universally free meals, with their maximum 530 calories, that were introduced by the coalition government in 2014.Significantly, the children’s BMI reverted to higher levels after school holidays of just one or two weeks, which invites speculation that children consume more calories at home or expend less energy through play and exercise than when they are at school.The new healthy school meals, which was prompted by campaigns from Jamie Oliver, cost £437 a year for each child and have hugely reduced the use of home-packed lunches for Britain’s youngest schoolchildren.Research done in 2010 found that the average lunchbox contained at 624 calories, and two-thirds of lunchboxes had at least two items of high-calorie, nutritionally empty foods, such as sweetened drinks, crisps and chocolate bars.Holford added: “We found a beneficial effect of school meals nationally, but it is also apparent when we look only at schoolchildren in more affluent areas. This suggests that even for children of middle-class parents, the school meals were more nutritionally balanced than what they were bringing in their lunch boxes.”The study is part of a larger Nuffield Foundation project tracing the impact of the policy of providing balanced school meals for all young children, on bodyweight outcomes, rates of absence as a result of ill health and attainment in school tests, with the full results due to be published early this summer.Campaigners want the government to roll the policy out to all primary and secondary schoolchildren, in a bid to counter a predicted rise in childhood obesity levels.Many US cities, such as New York, Boston and Chicago, provide free school meals for all school-age children. Free school meals have been given to children in Sweden since 1973 and in Finland since 1948.Stephanie Wood, founder of School Food Matters, which campaigns for healthy school meals, said the study’s findings were a wake-up call."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/043e6f8fe33b8e4f5470a35dcdc670def6b83c06/0_24_5554_3333/master/5554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70b126d8ad1b38ddb497e114fdd0022e","title":"new budget rules councils affect special needs school spending","story":"Campaigners have raised fears that children with special needs, such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, could lose out from new government rules that will prevent councils from subsidising education spending from other parts of their budgets.The failure of government funding to match growing demand has led many councils to overspend on their education budgets and raid their reserves, with the situation particularly acute in special-needs education.From next month councils will no longer be able to reduce education budget deficits by taking money from other areas of spending. Instead they will have to clear their education overspending with money from within their education budgets, unless they get special permission from the government. Critics fear this will squeeze funding for early years and special-needs education – two areas already financially stricken. Growing numbers of parents have to take legal action to get councils to provide special-needs support for their children, while nursery closures have risen sharply in recent years.Gillian Doherty, of the special-needs campaign group Send Action, told the Observer: “Last year the government argued at the high court that local authorities must ‘rob Peter to pay Paul’, using reserves and general council budgets to plug inadequate high-needs budgets.“The Department for Education’s new funding proposals will close off this flexibility. They have decided to forge ahead with these plans despite serious concerns raised through their own consultation about the impact on children and young people with special educational needs or disabilities.“Local authorities that are already failing to meet their legal duties are now being pressured to make further Send cuts in order to reduce deficits and stay within budget. A number of local authorities have identified cuts to Send provision, with the main targets being Send transport and funding levels for Education, Health and Care Plans, a move that will further undermine inclusion.”The government argues the changes are needed because, if councils can use general funds to cover education overspends, auditors will require them to increase their reserves in response – which would force them to cut spending in other areas such as social care. Councils backed the plans during consultation.Jonathan Broadbery of the National Day Nurseries Association said that some councils were already taking money from early years to cover gaps in special-needs funding. “While additional school funding should make overspends in school budgets less likely, these reforms make it harder for councils to cover these from other sources of funding. If school budget overspends have to be carried over to future years we could see more early years funding erted to plug these gaps.“We want to see proper investment in early years and that budget ring-fenced to ensure that all the funding that is allocated for our youngest children goes to ensuring they have the highest-quality early education and care. Otherwise overstretched councils will just be moving money around in their schools budget.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are increasing high-needs funding for local authorities by £780m next year. We have made clear councils are not required to cover the deficits from general funds. The department will work with councils with the largest deficits to agree plans to reduce deficits while ensuring that young people with special educational needs and disabilities continue to receive the support they need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/315a392eda5cacbb365670d78d837cdf8f854428/0_145_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53d910e67d3f92dfe202a8f294d10f9e","title":"australias extraordinary and vulnerable animals in pictures","story":"Pre-eminent Australian wildlife photographer Doug Gimesy has dedicated his career to the protection and conservation of some of the country’s most vulnerable species.

Made with a mostly young, non-professional cast, it’s a vibrant portrait of loving female friendship and contemporary London lifeSeven teenage girls are falling over themselves with laughter. They’re meant to be posing for a picture, but it’s a bit like photographing a box of puppies – they can’t keep still, pawing and hugging and joking, and bursting into coordinated dance moves. Someone puts on Beyoncé’s Brown Skin Girl, and her lyrics could hardly be more apt: “Your skin is not only dark, it shines and it tells your story Keep dancing, they can’t control you”.“One still one, please,” begs the photographer. But this is the cast of the film Rocks, a celebration of female friendship in east London – and they are unstoppable. They pull peace signs, stick out their tongues. They keep laughing.Rocks is directed by Sarah Gavron, and if it seems a world away from her last hit, 2015’s period drama Suffragette, both reflect her mission to put the lives of women in the spotlight. A collaborative project, co-written by Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson, Rocks tells a fictional story developed through workshops with teenage girls from east London, and its cast are largely non-professional actors making their screen debuts. The girls improvised the dialogue while two cameras rolled, giving Rocks a documentary-style feel and a tang of authenticity.The story focuses on Rocks, a British-Nigerian teenager played by Bukky Bakray, who lives on an estate in Hackney. When her mum, struggling with mental health issues, takes off, Rocks is left to look after her little brother – and fears they’ll be taken into care and separated if anyone finds out. As pressure mounts, she struggles to keep things together.The ’s Peter Bradshaw anointed Rocks the best film at Toronto film festival, describing the film-making as “in the spirit of Ken Loach’s Kes or Céline Sciamma’s Girlhood. It’s tough, but it’s the opposite of miserablist.” It’s true that the story is heart-wrenching, but the film as a whole builds an exhilarating portrait of loyal, loving female friendship and its vibrant, natural young cast offer a joyful snapshot of London teenagers, far from the gritty drama or poverty porn you might expect from a bald synopsis.“It’s an empowering and powerful film,” says 16-year-old Kosar Ali, who plays Rocks’s best friend, Sumaya. “It shows what people go through – how women of colour are taught to have a hard exterior. But Rocks’s journey and everything she goes through, and how powerful she is with friends by her side… it’s beautiful.”From the start, Gavron’s plan was “to make a film with girls rather than about them”. We chat while all seven are getting ready for their photoshoot: eating chips, winding each other’s headscarves, mock-pouting for selfies once their makeup is done. They grin and wave if they hear their names mentioned. Gavron wanted the film-making process to be as non-hierarchical as possible: a true collaboration with other women. So she, with Ikoko and Wilson, plus associate director Anu Henriques and casting director Lucy Pardee – who had cast non-professionals for Fish Tank and American Honey – worked together to find the right girls, and the right story.“It was a case of going into youth clubs, into schools, and absorbing what the girls were talking about, what life was like,” says Gavron. “It was like a documentary research process. And quickly we noticed that friendship is everything for girls at that age.”They began nine months of development workshops in 2017 with potential cast members mostly from years 8 and 9 from girls’ schools in Hackney and Newham. The stars were chosen not just for their ability to light up the screen, but their ability to light up each other: in no time they formed friendships that the film-makers were desperate to can.“What you see in Rocks is real, it’s not a video. It’s real life,” says Bakray, a British-Nigerian 17-year-old who, despite never having acted before, inhabits the title role with a rare mix of warm humour and wounded vulnerability. Bakray lives on an estate in Hackney, close to many of the locations around Dalston where Rocks was shot, and goes to a girl’s school in the area. She was born and raised in London by first-generation immigrant Christian parents, the youngest of four – and her three older brothers reflect a creative streak in the family too, one working in graphic design and another designing clothing.On screen, she and Ali have a touching friendship and it’s a delight to find that they do in real life, too: their affection fills the room. “Me and Bukky, we’re like this” – Ali mimes them being drawn together with her hands, fingers interlacing. “She’s at my house, like, three days a week.” Gavron visited Ali’s home, in Newham in east London, in the run-up to shooting – and it formed the model for Sumaya’s bustling, love-filled home, with a concerned mother and caring older siblings forming a stark contrast to Rocks’s isolation. In real life, Ali is also from a large British-Somalian Muslim family like Bakray, she was born in the UK to first-generation immigrant parents.From the first workshop, the two girls were inseparable. “Vibes. The first day. Instant vibes,” nods Bakray, sagely.“She’s like a mum, a best friend, a sister and an auntie in one,” says Ali of Bakray. “The things her brain comes up with, I could literally sit there and have a conversation with her for six hours.” Bakray tries to hide in Ali’s shoulder in embarrassment, but there’s no hiding the enormous smile on her face.British-Nigerian playwright Ikoko – her 2016 play, Girls, was about the Boko Haram kidnappings – also grew up on an estate in Hackney. She recognised something in Bakray, and had her in mind for the lead while writing: “People said ‘oh she looks a bit older than the others’ – but when she smiles, she’s a child again. We’re privileged to be around Bukky when she laughs: it’s the most infectious thing.”One of the refreshing things about Rocks is that the story centres on girls and friendship, not boys and romance. It swerves the classic teen movie obsession with getting the guy that runs from John Hughes movies right through to contemporary Netflix sensations such as To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.But that wasn’t the case to start with: the first script by Ikoko and Wilson (whose credits include The Little Drummer Girl, and a forthcoming adaption of Naomi Alderman’s The Power) wasn’t quite right: “We thought, something is off here,” Ikoko recalls. “We’ve spent a year with girls and yet the story is still turned by men.“Society often doesn’t let young black girls be young black girls,” she adds. “I really wanted to write something that said: I see your joy and your capacity for love, not just your resilience, your toughness.”Ikoko had also been working on another, more personal script. “It was a love story for my sister, who always protected me, who had to grow up before her time in order to allow me to be a child,” she explains. She sees the film as a way of saying thank you to her older sister, “for all of the things that she gave me.”She plucked up the courage to share this second, more intimate script with Wilson and Gavron. They loved it – and Rocks was born.“I conceived the story, but we all gave birth to it,” Ikoko insists, adding that the “magic” of the girls’ friendships and voices had already found its way into her writing.To further help the cast feel ownership, Ikoko and Wilson invited them to a writers’ room workshop. “We got them to Post-it note each scene and tell us what they thought,” says Wilson. “Which was pretty harsh at times!”Ali and Bakray are clearly proud of being involved at that level: “I describe it as a utopia,” says Bakray, “because it was mad: adults not just listening to you, but taking on the advice!”“You’re like: ‘What, me?’” chimes in Ali, her expressive eyes widening. “To have a say in what goes in an actual film is such a big thing. Especially the contrast to school.” Gavron even reshot one scene when Ali told her it wasn’t working.Do people underestimate teenagers?“Most definitely,” replies Bakray. “Teenagers are just mini adults. And adults are big teenagers!”“Especially when you’re young, your creativity is wild,” points out Ali. “Adults are missing out on that because they don’t want to listen.”“It’s time to give young people a chance to speak,” Bakray says. They’re both frustrated at not being able to vote on Brexit or in the election after all, Ali points out, it’s their generation who are going to live with the choices being made now.It’s clear the girls look up to Gavron. Part mentor, part mum figure, she recalls being hoarse at the end of every day’s filming, from shouting at them to take their headphones out and listen. But she also adds that she became “more admiring” of the girls as the shoot went on: “They’ve got such energy, but they’ve also got this initiative and tenacity. They are this amazing mix of children and adults – which is also often funny inadvertently,” she smiles.One memorable scene in Rocks is a massive food fight during a cookery class. They only did one take, and Gavron instructed them to really go for it – which they did, cake mix flying and people slipping over in the mess. Gavron had noticed during the research phase how young people use humour as a coping mechanism. “Sitting in the back of a class, we really noticed that even if a girl had told us privately that something difficult was going on at home, they’d be sitting there cracking jokes, laughing, finding joy.” This slipping between hilarity and heartbreak is a defining feature of the final movie.Equally important for Ali and Bakray is seeing ersity on screen. “In TV, the best friend is white and then the second friend is a person of colour,” points out Bakray. “We have two main protagonists who are people of colour, and the whole friendship group is a mixture of ethnicities.”While Ali is British-Somalian co-star Anastasia Dymitrow has Polish Romani heritage, and Afi Okaidja is London born to Congolese and Ghanaian parents. One of the few boys who in the film declares himself “Chinese-Jamaican-Ukrainian-English.” The film-makers did not need to engineer this mix. “It’s literally just a reflection of London today,” says Ikoko. She was determined to portray the Hackney she knew, full of life and colour and heat. “It’s a place of community – it’s not just a cool place to hang out on a Friday night, and it’s not just a place where people get shot and sell drugs.”So watching Rocks – once they’d got over the cringe-factor (“I wanted to punch myself” Ali deadpans) – was refreshing, even to its own stars.“I never saw a representation of myself on screen,” says Ali, frankly. “I’m Muslim, and the storylines for me are: you’re a terrorist, or you’re a victim.” It depresses her that depictions of London tend to focus on violence and how any story about young black people will be lazily dubbed “urban” (“I hate that whole category”), and that there’s so little range among the stories that do get told. “Imagine constantly looking at films and you’re not depicted, you can’t identify with characters – you’re missing out on so much.”Knife crime, petty theft, drugs and gang warfare on London’s estates often form a grimly titillating backdrop in police procedurals and crime dramas, while the “urban” tag kicked off with the likes of Noel Clarke’s trilogy, beginning with Kidulthood in 2006, showing teenagers drinking and fighting their way round the city. More recently, the acclaimed series Top Boy to Netflix has returned, but does also paint a gloomy, gritty picture of east London, focusing on rival drug gangs.The lack of screen representation also explains why Rocks’s young stars had never dreamed of being film stars – or of any career in the creative industries – before being invited into the workshops. “Acting was never a thing. There’s not other people like you doing it, so why would I go do that,” admits Ali.Bakray, meanwhile, has joined Rada youth theatre. “We go see Shakespeare, and other really old playwrights. It’s sick it’s teaching me a lot.”But both are honest about a culture clash: film-making is not a world their parents are familiar with, and they have understandable anxieties.“My mum’s supportive, always, but as a mother – especially when you’ve left your culture behind, your religion – you’d be worried about what your child pursues,” says Ali.When I ask how their mums reacted to the film, both crease up. “Humbling!” Ali laughs. “No extra portions!” throws in Bakray.“They’re happy for sure, for all the work we’ve done, but they keep us humble always,” smiles Ali. “I sent my mum the Rocks trailer – and she just called me to tell me to wash the dishes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ac54e93add322c65141b5adf1e649f233172b5/0_125_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc8a07ef5823b76d64c401e1defdf68","title":"bernd leno arsenal west ham mikel arteta","story":"Keeper’s fine display against West Ham crowned a madcap week but the story of Mikel Arteta’s reign is quiet consistencyIt was another great Arsenal No 1, David Seaman, who always claimed that the real gauge of a keeper’s worth is not in the mistake itself, but the reaction. Dropped crosses and fumbled shots are an occupational hazard. Nobody is immune. But if you want to judge a goalkeeper, Seaman argued, watch their next game.How’s their confidence? How’s their mettle? Do they shrink? Do they hide? Here, nine days after the error that helped eliminate Arsenal from Europe, was Bernd Leno’s answer. Left out of the squad for Arsenal’s FA Cup game last Monday, Leno will have had plenty of time to contemplate his hashed 119th-minute clearance against Olympiakos: to watch some of the scathing media reaction, to dwell on his misjudgment. Then he stepped out against West Ham on Saturday and produced a performance of nerve, resilience and outstanding reflexes that was probably the difference between three points and none.It was Alexandre Lacazette who grabbed the headlines for his late winning goal but on a day when Arsenal looked curiously vulnerable, this felt like Leno’s victory. With West Ham’s cagey 4-4-2 system generating plenty of openings on the break, it was Leno who stood up to them: smothering the ball at Sébastian Haller’s feet in the first half, saving a close-range shot from the same player late in the second.His standout moment, however, came on 55 minutes, when he somehow managed not only to stop Michail Antonio’s free header from seven yards, but parry it so powerfully that it set up Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for an immediate counterattack. It was, Lacazette would later gush, an amazing save, albeit of the sort Arsenal would rather he did not have to make quite so often.This, in many ways, is the goalkeeper’s paradox: very often their own success is a figuration of the team’s wider failures. You only had to watch the bristling reaction of the Sheffield United manager, Chris Wilder, to the news that Dean Henderson was named man of the match in their 1-0 win over Norwich on Saturday (“He’s only made a couple of saves! That’s what he’s there for.”). If your goalkeeper is the standout player, something’s probably gone wrong somewhere else on the pitch.Yet this is not the only reason Arsenal fans have often been ambivalent to Leno in the two years since he joined from Bayer Leverkusen for around £19m. As the past fortnight has perfectly demonstrated, Leno can lose games, but he wins and rescues plenty more. The draws against Wolves, Southampton and Norwich immediately spring to mind as games that Arsenal would almost certainly have lost without their big flexible German to bail them out.Equally, there was the horrible mistake against Chelsea in December, when he came for a cross and ended up flapping at thin air as Jorginho scored. Then there was the botched save in the north London derby in September, when he palmed Érik Lamela’s shot straight to Christian Eriksen.Leno came to Arsenal with a reputation for inspired shot-stopping and the occasional calamitous lapse, such as the error-strewn display for Germany at the 2017 Confederations Cup that probably cost him a place in Joachim Löw’s World Cup squad the following year. Thus far, that pattern seems to have held: since his arrival in England, no Premier League goalkeeper has made more errors leading directly to goals (Martin Dubravka, David de Gea and Jordan Pickford are level with him, on seven).You might think Leno’s mixture of greatness and madness would not necessarily be the ideal tonic for an emotionally brittle club trying to shrug off the vexing inconsistency that has beset it for more than a decade. In fact, as Seaman would doubtless point out, Leno’s value to Arsenal is more complex than a simple ledger of points won and points lost.In an age when goalkeepers are required to set the tone, to be more aggressive and proactive and open to risk than at any point in recent history, perhaps the mistakes and the inspirational match-winning displays are simply two sides of the same coin.Leno may not yet be in the class of Ederson or Alisson, even if at 28 he has plenty of time to develop further. But it’s remarkable how much more assured he has looked since the arrival of Mikel Arteta, with the confidence that comes from a cogent strategy and the security that comes from playing behind a semi-functional defence. Arsenal have conceded 12 goals in Arteta’s first 15 games, compared with 28 in Unai Emery’s last 15 games. Though Leno is not solely responsible for that, it tallies with what the eyes tell us about a player who – with a little patience – may just show us where this Arsenal team are heading."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4630195e13d150ff549305b84c301c4623ed5f74/0_1189_3748_2249/master/3748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7b59612b3ec082f51d49201b5ea9202","title":"japan england shebelieves cup match report football","story":"If there were numerous questions to be asked about England’s future under Phil Neville, then this narrow victory did little to answer them. A late tap-in from Ellen White, after a defensive howler, secured a desperately needed win against a Japan side they convincingly beat at the World Cup last summer. There will be relief in the dressing room but once again the Lionesses looked unable to get the better of a team that appeared to have nullified the attacking threat posed by Neville’s side.“It’s good for everybody to feel the win,” the manager said. “Winning will give us the ability to build a new team spirit, a new togetherness. You can’t manufacture togetherness.”Neville had been heavily criticised for his team selection in the SheBelieves Cup opener, a tepid defeat by the USA. That 2-0 loss, their sixth defeat in nine games, heaped pressure on the games to follow and, when the teamsheet arrived, there was a buzz in the air. The 19-year-old Lauren Hemp, who impressed against the world champions, was again entrusted with a place out wide. She was joined by Everton’s 22-year-old Chloe Kelly on the opposite flank and Chelsea’s top scorer, Beth England, up top. It was a fighting move from the publicly stoic England manager and one fans and critics alike have been crying out for: to play the in-form young players ahead of the less convincing stalwarts.“They did really well,” said Neville. “There was a freshness and an unpredictability.” Neville’s is a tough position for any manager. Phasing out an old guard that have given so much to the game without disrupting the dressing room is no easy task. The inexperienced group began brightly against a Japanese team that had, until their defeat by Spain in Orlando, won all their games since their World Cup exit. But with Keira Walsh alone in front of the back line, Japan’s tricky attacker Mina Tanaka and best forward Mana Iwabuchi found success between the lines of England’s 4-1-4-1.After a frantic start Hemp got the better of the right-back Risa Shimizu but her shot was low and too close to Sakiko Ikeda, who palmed wide. With half an hour gone a neat backheel from Jordan Nobbs enabled England to force a fine save from Ikeda before Georgia Stanway’s follow-up was blocked. “Love it! Love it!” shouted Neville from the sidelines.The longer the Lionesses went without a goal, though, the more nervy proceedings became. Pressing harder and higher after the break proved fruitful but on the hour mark Neville reverted to a much more conservative line-up with the lively Kelly and Hemp swapped out for Toni Duggan and Nikita Parris, while Leah Williamson, played somewhat cruelly at right-back against the USA, came on for an overworked Walsh in central midfield.“When the senior ones came on at the end they had that game knowledge and game management that we need along the journey,” said Neville. That was one take. An alternative was that, when push came to shove, he copped out of entrusting his young charges to find the winner in the dying, intense minutes.Less than 10 minutes later England found herself taken off for White. It was a strange move when anything less than a win would likely see England plummet further down the world rankings, having occupied third place before the World Cup.For Chelsea England has scored 14 goals and performed well in a front two with the Australian Sam Kerr. While White is more used to leading the line alone, playing a lone forward seems an odd hill for the manager to die on. “We do play a system where we don’t play two out-and-out centre-forwards,” said Neville, before he conceded that it would be something they could “look to integrate into our future planning”.The substitutions took the sting out of England’s tail. With seven minutes remaining, though, White lifted the pressure a little. Shiori Miyake conceded the ball to Duggan just inside the box on the right and the Atlético Madrid forward chipped a neat pass into the feet of the striker, who poked home.There was palpable relief in the familiar goggles celebration, and from the bench, but this was a much tougher and laboured win than it should have been against a team ranked four places below them. It was a victory Neville needed but it was not a pretty one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/424791f7bd6422c09ba041961f2f6b6a647a43f6/0_39_2884_1730/master/2884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1caec2c2c09e492c5e3756c06c890a7","title":"manchester united manchester city premier league match report derby","story":"Manchester United have a first league double for a decade over Manchester City in a further sign that the faith shown by the board in Ole Gunnar Solskjær is being repaid.United made their crosstown rivals appear the tamest City side brought here during Pep Guardiola’s four years in charge on a day Ederson will wish to forget for being directly culpable for Anthony Martial’s opener and Scott McTominay’s late second.United were simply more dangerous than their strangely toothless opponents and were deserving victors in this 182nd derby that ended as a third win over City in all competitions this season, leading to the kind of jubilant scenes not witnessed at Old Trafford in recent memory.United remain in fifth, firmly in the hunt for a Champions League berth, while making it 10 matches unbeaten. City, though, will be dethroned as champions and Liverpool crowned before the Merseysiders play again if Guardiola’s side lose their next two matches, against Arsenal and Burnley.Solskjær fielded a 3-4-1-2 that showed seven changes from Thursday’s FA Cup victory at Derby. Guardiola’s familiar 4-1-4-1 had one fewer adjustment, the headline being that Kevin De Bruyne’s sore shoulder meant he was excluded, as Phil Foden became the youngest Englishman to start this fixture for City for 12 years.Solskjær spoke of having to press and this is how his team began: Nicolás Otamendi, Ederson and Oleksandr Zinchenko all being hassled by United’s excellent front three – Anthony Martial, Daniel James and Bruno Fernandes.In what was a vibrant atmosphere City claimed two corners – each off Brandon Williams, the second deriving from a clearing header. This pointed to a passage of City dominance in which Martial had to clear from under David de Gea’s bar, the goalkeeper having previously kept the scores level with a sharp save.This came when Sergio Agüero raced along the right with Luke Shaw in attendance. The No 10 turned and found Foden and he switched the ball left to Raheem Sterling. A dip of the shoulders and the forward was clear – his shot was heading in De Gea’s left-hand corner before he steered it wide.United were in danger of being engulfed by the blue wave. Foden probed and saw a Harry Maguire clearance rebound off him for a goal-kick. From this, though, the home side finally broke clear, Bruno Fernandes hit James early, and he ran through, though his attempt was too close to Ederson.This quick-release tactic came close to bearing fruit the next time United threatened. This time Williams hit Martial, though after an instant bring-down his shot was blocked.James was next to utilise speed: the jet-heeled wide man turned Otamendi inside and out along the right and drew the foul. Fernandes hit the wall from the free-kick, Fred nutmegged Zinchenko, and United were now posing all the questions. One of these had Martial outmanoeuvring Fernandinho and cutting in from the left but a tame shot made easy work for Ederson.The goalkeeper, though, was about to commit his first howler. Fernandes won and took a free-kick on the left, after being kicked by Ilkay Gündogan. The German was then doubly at fault as he and Agüero allowed Martial to glide in and volley Fernandes’s dinked delivery. This went straight at Ederson yet in a butterfingers moment he allowed the ball to squeeze under his hands at the near post.City were now being punched open at will. Aaron Wan-Bissaka had become a buccaneering right-back, terrorising the visitors along his flank. Fernandes, Martial, Fred and James joined him in a free-for-all that had Guardiola’s men in damage-limitation mode, desperate to reach the break.They did, still at 1-0 – perhaps fortunately as during the half’s closing exchanges Otamendi looked to have brought down Fred for a penalty. VAR did not intervene and instead Mike Dean, the referee, booked the midfielder. “Penalty, clear penalty,” was Solskjær’s verdict.What City had missed was the usual power to bewitch their opponent from midfield. At the second-half’s start they found their range. Raheem Sterling slipped in Agüero and he finished but this was ruled offside.Ederson, though, still slumbered. A João Cancelo back-pass was mis-controlled and with Martial thundering in the keeper only just recovered.City claimed a corner on the right and from 25 yards Foden’s shot was tipped over for another from the same quadrant. This came to nothing and Guardiola swapped Agüero and Bernardo Silva for Gabriel Jesus and Riyad Mahrez, the Catalan’s frantic body language telling the tale of his team: an odd lack of poise and skill when required.Instead another James burst left Otamendi resembling a statue and Ederson had to repel a blistering effort. And while from here City probed along both flanks, forcing corners, now came the second Ederson calamity: a throw out in the 96th minute went straight to McTominay and the substitute found the empty net from 40 yards out.Solskjær punched the air and at the final whistle United’s support serenaded their manager with “Ole Ole Ole”. He and his men are certainly building the late-season momentum so badly missed last year when everything fell apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7514120ccb229f423df549cfbde522f979b90352/0_0_6250_3750/master/6250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fbfa170e6e6f5e0c0398feb30ee3c54","title":"how to boost your immune system to avoid colds and coronavirus","story":"You’re washing your hands 10 times a day and have stopped touching your face. What else can you do to improve your health and avoid bugs?It’s been a long, wet winter. Everybody has got colds, and now we are braced for a coronavirus epidemic. Boosting our immune system has rarely felt more urgent, but, beyond eating more tangerines and hoping for the best, what else can we do?Sheena Cruickshank, a professor of immunology at the University of Manchester, has a “shocking cold” when we speak at a safe distance, over the phone. To know how to take care of your immune system, she says, first you need to understand the weapons in your armoury – a cheeringly impressive collection, it turns out.“When you come into contact with a germ you’ve never met before,” she says, “you’ve got various barriers to try to stop it getting into your body.” As well as skin, we have mucus – “snot is a really important barrier” – and a microbiome, the collective noun for the estimated 100tn microbes that live throughout our bodies, internally and externally. Some of these helpful bugs make antimicrobial chemicals and compete with pathogens for food and space.Beneath these writhing swamps of mucus and microbes, our bodies are lined with epithelial cells which, says Cruickshank, “are really hard to get through. They make antimicrobial products including, most relevant to coronavirus, antiviral compounds that are quite hostile.”If a pathogen breaches these defences, it has to deal with our white blood cells, or immune cells. One type, called macrophages, inhabit all our body tissue and, says Cruickshank, “have all these weapons ready to go, but they’re not terribly precise”. They report to the cleverer, adaptive white blood cells known as lymphocytes. They are the ones that remember germs, “so if you meet that germ again,” says Cruickshank, “they’ll just deal with it probably without you even knowing. That’s when you’ve got immunity and is the basis of vaccination. It’s trying to bypass all the early stuff and create the memory, so you don’t have to be sick.”Our immune systems may have blind spots. “This might mean that our immune response doesn’t recognise certain bugs,” she says, “or the bugs have sneaky evasion strategies. Personally, my immune system is not necessarily very good at seeing colds.” But a healthy lifestyle will ensure your defences are as good as they get.Seeing as our bodies contain more cells belonging to microbes, such as bacteria and yeasts, than human ones, let’s start with the microbiome. “We live in a symbiotic relationship with our gut bacteria,” says Prof Arne Akbar, the president of the British Society for Immunology and a professor at University College, London. “Having the right ones around, that we evolved with, is best for our health. Anything we do that alters that can be detrimental.”Not only do our microbes form protective barriers, they also programme our immune systems. Animals bred with no microbiome have less well developed immune responses. Older people, and those with diseases that are characterised by inflammation, such as allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, tend to have less varied gut microbiomes.To feed your gut flora, Cruickshank recommends “eating a more varied diet with lots of high-fibre foods”. Being vegetarian isn’t a prerequisite for microbiome health, but the more plant foods you consume, the better. “The microbiome really likes fibre, pulses and fermented foods,” she adds.Kefir yoghurt and pickles such as sauerkraut and kimchi are among the fermented delicacies now fashionable thanks to our increasing knowledge of the microbiome. But the evidence for taking probiotic supplements, she says, “is mixed”. It’s not a dead cert that they will survive the journey through your digestive tract, or that they will hang around long enough if they do. “It’s more effective to change your diet,” says Cruickshank.The skin microbiome is important, too, but we know less about it. High doses of ultraviolet light (usually from the sun) can affect it negatively, weakening any protective functions (as well as triggering immune suppression in the skin itself). Overwashing with strong soaps and using antibacterial products is not friendly to our skin microbiomes. “Combinations of perfumes and moisturisers might well also have an effect,” says Cruickshank.To be immunologically fit, you need to be physically fit. “White blood cells can be quite sedentary,” says Akbar. “Exercise mobilises them by increasing your blood flow, so they can do their surveillance jobs and seek and destroy in other parts of the body.” The NHS says adults should be physically active in some way every day, and do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity (hiking, gardening, cycling) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (running, swimming fast, an aerobics class).The advice for older people, who are more vulnerable to infection, is to do whatever exercise is possible. “Anything’s better than nothing,” says Akbar. But a lifetime’s exercise could significantly slow your immune system declining with age. In 2018, a study by University of Birmingham and King’s College London found that 125 non-smoking amateur cyclists aged 55 to 79 still had the immune systems of young people.The other side of the coin, says Akbar, “is elite athletes who become very susceptible to infections because you can exercise to a point where it has a negative impact on your immune system.” This problem is unlikely to affect most of us unless, says Cruickshank, “you’re a couch potato and suddenly try and run a marathon, this could introduce stress hormones and be quite bad for your immune system”.One of the many happy side-effects of exercise is that it reduces stress, which is next on our list of immune-boosting priorities. Stress hormones such as cortisol can compromise immune function, a common example of which, says Akbar, is when chickenpox strikes twice. If you have had it, the virus never completely goes away. “During periods of stress,” he says, “it can reactivate again and we get shingles.”Forget boozing through the coronavirus crisis, because heavy drinking also depletes our immune cells. “Some studies have suggested that the first-line-of-defence macrophages are not as effective in people who have had a lot of alcohol,” says Cruickshank. “And there’s been suggestions that high alcohol consumption can lead to a reduction of the lymphocytes as well. So if the bug gets into you, you’re not going to be as good at containing and fighting it off.”Cruickshank says that vitamin D has become a hot topic in immunology. “It is used by our macrophages, and is something that people in Britain can get quite low on in the winter.” Necking extra vitamin C, however, is probably a waste of time for well-fed westerners. It’s not that vitamin C isn’t crucial to immune function (and other things, such as bone structure). “All the vitamins are important,” says Cruickshank, “but vitamin C is water soluble, it’s not one that your body stores.” Eating your five a day of fruits and vegetables is the best way to maintain necessary levels.Exercising and eating well will have the likely knock-on effect of helping you sleep better, which is a bonus because a tired body is more susceptible to bugs. One study last year found that lack of sleep impaired the disease-fighting ability of a type of lymphocyte called T cells, and research is demonstrating the importance of our natural biorhythms overall.Janet Lord, a professor at the University of Birmingham, recently showed that vaccinating people in the morning is more effective than doing so in the afternoon. “Your natural biorhythms are, to some extent, dictated by sleep,” says Akbar. “If you’ve got a regular sleep pattern, you have natural body rhythms and everything’s fine. If they go out of kilter, then you’ve got problems.”The seriousness of an infection largely depends on the dose you are hit with, which could in turn depend on how contagious the carrier is when they cough near you. “We’re constantly exposed to germs, and we only get sick from a handful of those,” says Cruickshank.If you’re reasonably young and healthy, says Akbar, the mild benefits you may achieve from being extra good probably won’t fend off a severe dose of coronavirus or flu. The likely scenario if you catch the infection is, he says, “you’ll be sick for a while and you will recover”.From a public-health perspective, when nasty viruses such as coronavirus are doing the rounds, Akbar’s priority is not boosting already healthy people’s immune systems, “but protecting the vulnerable people. Older people don’t respond that well to the flu jab, though it’s better for them to have it than not. It’s a general problem of immune decline with ageing.”When we get older, he says, the barrier function in the gut doesn’t work that well, “so you have something called leaky gut syndrome, where bugs creep into our bodies causing mild infections”. This causes inflammation around the body, as does the natural accumulation of old “zombie” cells, called senescent cells, and inflammation compromises the immune response.Akbar is working on developing drug treatments to reduce inflammation in older people but they are a way off yet. Age 65 is when, medically, one is considered older, “but that’s arbitrary”, says Akbar. “Some old people might get problems much earlier. And there are older people who are totally healthy.”“In terms of coronavirus,” says Cruickshank, “it’s mostly spread by droplet transmission, as far as we can tell, so the biggest thing is hygiene.” So wash your hands, and sneeze and cough into tissues, she suggests, between sniffles. No one can completely avoid getting sick, not even top immunologists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2febeffea29621ab75cc0f931c59ee17f4dcbec3/0_0_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a4076dcb90a7262c41bb28eb8916749","title":"how to shower without damaging your skin","story":"Watch the temperature and apply moisturiser afterwards – but don’t worry about scrubbing your legsHow often you should shower usually depends on your age. Older people, babies and young children are more prone to dry skin, which can lead to eczema, so bathing every other day is best. For most people who have relatively normal skin, bathing every day is OK, but there are things you can do to avoid it drying out.Skin hydration is ensured by the bricks-and-mortar structure of the dead skin cells on the surface, which are bound together by natural moisturising compounds such as ceramides. Together, they keep moisture in your skin and prevent it from evaporating, but frequent bathing can strip this barrier away.To protect it, avoid taking scalding-hot and very long showers. After showering, apply moisturising cream while your skin is still damp, to lock in that moisture, rather than drying yourself thoroughly and then applying cream. If you have sensitive skin, avoid heavily fragranced soaps, which contain additives that can cause irritation or allergic reactions. Choose brands formulated for your skin type.You do not need to wash all over unless you are really dirty soapy water will run down your legs and feet anyway. But the upper leg and groin area is one to wash regularly, because it can become colonised by pathogens.People often want to scrub their skin clean, but most exfoliating scrub products can cause traumatic micro-abrasions on the skin. In general, if you want to exfoliate, acid-based accelerators, such as glycolic or lactic acids, are more gentle. When it comes to your feet, products containing urea, which breaks up dry, dead skin cells, will soften better than abrasive scrubs.Kathleen Suozzi is an assistant professor of dermatology at Yale School of Medicine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7886a9320a101c8f06d1d5931ae4072e814e55e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d6282c530cbf9bd56b44481083ea13","title":"i have culled my friends to just the ones i value","story":"I’ve always had loads of friends but recently decided that many of them had to go. It has simplified and enriched my lifeOne night about six months ago, as I was tidying up for the babysitter at the same time as battling to put the kids to bed, all while trying to answer a multitude of suddenly-urgent questions they’d had all day to ask, and put lipstick on, I caught sight of my frantic-looking face in the mirror. What, I wondered, was I doing all this for? Was it worth it simply to spend the evening with a couple we didn’t really like, drink insipid wine and make shallow small-talk about other people we don’t really know or want to spend time with?I’ve always been a more-the-merrier type person and someone who prided herself on being a good friend. I have friends from all areas of my life – school, university, work – but as I got older and the demands of raising three young children and work have grown, I’ve realised that something had to give. And that something has ended up being my friendships. Not all of them, but I’ve certainly had something of a reassessment.It wasn’t a contrived thing at first. It was more of an inevitable decline as the children have got older (they are 11, almost 8 and 6) which has left me, their designated driverslave (football one night, Scouts the next, never-ending homework etc) feeling frazzled. But it’s also because, since turning 40 two years ago, I have, I suppose, become less of a social butterfly and make less of an effort generally. I’ve reached a stage where I choose a bath and a book over a night out.So I decided to prioritise a small number of people, rather than try to keep up and maintain lots of different, superfluous friendships. It started with something of an online “cull”. The “friend” who always tried to make her life look like something out of a Boden catalogue with never-ending perfect images of her children along with the nauseating hashtag #blessed. The mum from school who hardly said a word to me at the school gates but looked at every story the second I posted it on Instagram and probably gossiped about it afterwards. The people who popped up on Facebook who I hadn’t seen for years and these days wouldn’t cross the road to say hello to.Unfollowing, unfriending and, in some cases, even blocking, made me feel calmer and more in control. It helped prevent FOPO – Fear of People’s Opinion – and quelled the anxiety I sometimes get after sharing something spontaneously on social media. So I began to do the same sort of thing IRL too.I stopped making the effort with the people who leave it to me to initiate every meet-up and nurture friendships that, in the words of Marie Kondo, no longer spark joy. Those who I had to bite my tongue with, who looked at their phone constantly while I was talking to them. Those who cancelled meet-ups one too many times or who I saw out of a sense of obligation and duty rather than want. The friend who said “Have you really?” in an incredulous way after I told her I’d lost weight.I stopped texting people back if I didn’t really want to see them, and arranging coffees and lunches unless someone really made the effort. I stopped hanging around the school gates to chat unless someone really made a beeline for me.I used to view my birthday as a great excuse to get my friends together but I’ve more or less canned that too. Last year I met my husband for lunch instead and I’ll be doing the same again this year.It’s not something that’s been entirely painless or come without guilt though. I sometimes see people’s names pop up on social media or hear about them in passing conversation and feel a sense of sadness and loss. There are also a few friendships I have lost along the way that I mourn for. Those who fell by the wayside or those I hoped would last. And those where they have perhaps decided I wasn’t worth the effort either.An autism diagnosis for one of our children a few years ago was also something of a catalyst. The lead up to it, endless difficult phone calls, school meetings, referrals, sleepless nights and then a new school, was really stressful. It highlighted the friends who really cared and wanted to understand what we were going through, and those who didn’t seem to. Maybe they were swept up in their own problems at the time or they didn’t know what to say, but it certainly helped give me clarity on the people I wanted to keep in my life.I have also taken a more “holistic” approach to friendship. Working from home can be quite solitary and my life is pretty much ruled by deadlines. As time has become more limited, I’ve become more careful about who I spend it with. I see going for lunch with a good friend as being as important as going for a run or to the gym in terms of maintaining wellbeing – but it has to be a frien dship really worth investing in.I have, as a result, concentrated on nurturing a small number. Primarily, four women I was at primary school with and have known for over three decades. We don’t get to see each other that often because we live in different parts of the country, all work and have 12 children between us, but it’s always lovely when we do.Our shared history – the fact that I remember their parents’ landline numbers, names of their childhood pets and the boy they lost their virginity to – gives us a firm foundation and a comfortable camaraderie. Theirs is the one WhatsApp group I always want to be in – we share everything going on in our day-to-day lives, from parenting problems to silly gifs.I’ve also kept in touch with those low-maintenance friends who I don’t see all the time but who always give me a bit of a lift. The neighbour who also works from home who I can meet for lunch at the drop of a hat my nearby freelancer friend who I can share my work woes with over coffee the London friend with no kids who always knows the best places to go, makes me laugh and who is always up for an impromptu drink or five. I’ve also made new friends along the way, mainly through social media and with women who are self-employed parents like me.Overall though, I’ve found that, when it comes to friendships, less really is more –something that has even been scientifically proven. A recent report, from the University of Leeds, found that those with a small number of close friends had higher levels of wellbeing and were happier with their social lives. While they didn’t specify a prerequisite number of friends, I would guess that, for most people, it would be less than you can count on two hands.The study of 1,496 adults, published in Psychology and Aging, found that younger people had larger social networks but these consisted mostly of “peripheral” friends, such as colleagues or online-only friends. Older people with closer, more positive friendships fared better emotionally. Dr Wändi Bruine de Bruin, the report’s author, said: “If you feel lonely, it may be more helpful to make a positive connection with a friend than to try and seek out new people.” In other words, you need to nurture your existing friendships rather than seek out new ones.I haven’t had much of a backlash from my friendship cull so far, apart from one angry, highly strung former school friend who sent a flurry of unpleasant messages after I unfriended her. Others have quietly ebbed away into the ether. Which just goes to show, they probably weren’t the best of friends to begin with.I’ve found focusing on quality rather than quantity much more enriching and it has simplified my life in many ways. I’m spending less money on babysitters too.1. Think about the people you see regularly and text without thinking. Those are probably your core friends.2. Ask yourself what you get from this friendship and whether you put in equal effort. If the answer is not much andor no then it might be one to let go of.3. If you’re not brave enough to delete someone on social media just engage with them less, mute or unfollow them first and see how you feel. If it makes you feel better then that’s a good indicator.4. Treat others as you would like to be treated. Decreasing contact is kinder than ghosting.5. We probably all have a number of people who Bridget Jones called “jellyfishes”. Those who seemingly accidentally say something hurtful or leave you feeling low. Ask yourself whether you want those sorts of people in your life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c61c7a4ee51d6fc4579c138864aafcb13d6ba1/540_1056_1241_745/master/1241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=673d20f4ba201eb82be5459bd4ef0c48","title":"embroidered female portraits in pictures","story":"“I never studied embroidery formally,” says Malaysian-born artist Sheena Liam, who creates female portraits in dark thread, with strands used to represent hair escaping in locks and plaits from the canvas.

Our expert gives her adviceThe numbers of diagnosed coronavirus cases in the UK is still relatively low, but the epidemic has been causing havoc for those with travel plans. As the situation evolves, inidual countries – and travel operators – are introducing different policies, leaving some travellers stranded, others uncertain and many out of pocket. Advice from airlines has been confusing, with some offering refunds or rebookings to passengers headed for risky regions and some leaving them to their fate. Insurers are similarly ided in what they will and won’t offer. For those wondering what to do about an impending holiday, it’s important to know when a refund is a right and when it depends on goodwill.I’m due to go on holiday to Venice this month but I’m worried about the infection in northern Italy. I’m a diabetic and the symptoms could prove severe. If I cancel am I entitled to my money back?RD, Buxton, DerbyshireNo is the short answer, although that doesn’t mean it’s not worth a try, since some airlines and holiday firms are refunding or rebooking customers as a goodwill gesture. Ordinarily, travel insurance won’t pay out unless the Foreign Office advises against travel to your destination. Insurers may make an exception if your GP confirms that your condition makes it risky for you to travel.I booked flights from London to Delhi with Oman Air to attend a wedding. A fellow guest, booked with Virgin Atlantic, informed me that India was revoking visas for visitors who had recently been in China. Virgin notified passengers of the new rules and promised refunds. Oman Air had no idea of the restriction. Eventually it conceded that I would not be allowed to board. It is only willing to refund the refundable taxes, leaving me £217 out of pocket.EH, BathOrdinarily a passenger denied boarding would be entitled to a refund under EC regulation 2612004. However, article 2(j) exempts airlines from liability if there are “reasonable grounds” such as health, safety or inadequate travel documentation. All of those could be applied to you, meaning that you are not entitled to your money back, although some airlines are being more sympathetic. Many passengers are struggling to get accurate information from airlines and booking agents so it’s vital that you make your own checks. Oman Air did not respond to requests for a comment.We were booked to go on a Royal Caribbean cruise from Hong Kong. Due to the coronavirus, Royal Caribbean asked us to change our flights to Singapore instead. It has since cancelled the cruise 13 days before the sailing date and will refund us the cost. However, the airline is refusing to offer a credit note as it has already amended our flights once.JM, Sunbury, SurreySadly, you’re only entitled to a refund for all components of a holiday if you booked a package. Cruise passengers are particularly vulnerable to the rapidly evolving crisis, not only because any flights booked separately are non-refundable unless the airline is prepared to be flexible, but because ships have proved an incubator for the virus. The Cruise Lines International Association says its members will deny boarding to anyone who has been in South Korea, China, Hong Kong or Macau within 14 days of joining the cruise ship. Some firms have gone further with bans of up to 30 days. Royal Caribbean is vetoing those who have travelled through Iran or parts of Italy or has come within 6ft of someone who has. Each company offers different refund policies. If you booked a through ticket you are entitled to a refund for the whole route if a connecting flight is cancelled. If, on the other hand, you had booked the two flights separately, then a carrier who cancels one has no responsibility to refund the other. This experience shows the downside of booking through third-party brokers. Many of them allow themselves up to three months to pass on a refund and retain a fee for their trouble. TravelUp’s terms and conditions make no mention of what it explained is a “merchant and administration fee”. It blamed airlines for the lengthy turnaround and said it refunds the monies received from the airline, but not the full sum originally paid by passengers, which includes the fee. After Observer involvement it repaid you the full amount as “goodwill”. Passengers whose flights are cancelled can in fact claim a refund directly from the airline under EC 2612004, according to Coby Benson of the aviation specialist solicitor Bott \u0026amp Co, and airlines have no business batting them back to the booking agent. Since the coronavirus counts as an “extraordinary circumstance”, the usual compensation is not payable on top of the refund. However, some flights have been cancelled because the epidemic has reduced demand rather than because of official restrictions, so compensation is due as well as a refund or rebooking.My flight to Manila via Hong Kong was cancelled. I booked through Opodo which claims it has lodged a refund request with the airline, while the airline denies receiving it. Moreover, Opodo says it will take 90 days to process. I am wondering whether it would be worth lodging a section 75 claim with the credit card I used to book the flights.SM, StockportSection 75 of the Consumer Credit Act holds card issuers jointly liable for claims for breach of contract or misrepresentation and is unlikely to apply in this situation. Moreover, banks can refuse to consider claims when a transaction has been made via a third party. As above, you’d be best claiming directly through the airline under EC 2612004. Opodo said: “We cannot proceed with any refunds until airlines have granted authorisation, which is why we advise there is a 90-day turnaround to manage expectations.”A friend booked BA flights to Tokyo to run the marathon, which was later cancelled. Other airlines have refunded passengers or kept their tickets open for a year for no extra charge. My friend was told she had 48 hours to change the flights to somewhere else for a steep fee or lose the £2,000 ticket value. If they found alternative flights costing less than the original ticket, they lost the difference.NA, LondonThis situation is likely to become more common as countries ban large gatherings. If you bought flights, accommodation and tickets for an event separately, you are not protected unless there’s a Foreign Office warning against travel to the area. Package bookings may be eligible for a refund in these circumstances since under the package travel regulations, you can request your money back if a tour operator makes a “significant change” to the arrangements. BA has announced that bookings made between 3 and 16 March can be postponed for no extra charge, but passengers who wish to cancel seats booked before that are subject to usual rules depending on the type of ticket."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/622d850a5201884ef044bce75e767d47466d542b/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1c19a5ab6af4388fa1ea6c9d9712265","title":"missy mazzoli kelly moran review london","story":"St Giles Cripplegate, LondonMazzoli’s ethereal minimalism seemed to warp time and space, while Moran coaxed a blizzard of effects from her piano in a show that defied categorisationThe American composer Missy Mazzoli has said that her ideal listener would know nothing about her or her music before hearing it, removing any preconceived ideas based on genre. In many ways, seeing her work performed live is also something of a distraction. She has written two operas and numerous works for symphony orchestras, string quartets, solo instruments, electronics and for her own art-pop band, Victoire, but often Mazzoli’s compositions are about subverting each format.Tonight, in a duet with the Swiss violinist Etienne Abelin, Mazzoli plays piano and triggers string and choral samples on a laptop, while Abelin’s bel canto violin lines are drenched in effects and reverb. At some moments you don’t know where the sounds are emerging or how they are being produced, which only erts you from how beautiful much of this music is – an ethereal baroque minimalism that seems to warp space and time.Sharing the bill is Kelly Moran, who performs on a second grand piano, meticulously prepared by inserting dozens of small bolts into the strings of the top four octaves. On record – including her two recent albums for the label Warp – this prepared piano sounds glassy and bell-like. In the wayward acoustic of this medieval church, it creates a blizzard of effects: her florid right-hand curlicues can sound like a zither, hammered dulcimer, koto, harpsichord, gamelan or, occasionally, an accident in the kitchen.The evening ends with two MoranMazzoli collaborations in which Moran’s melodies move into spikier territory while Mazzoli’s counterpoints become more hypnotic. An entire album of duets between these unique artists would be a treat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5975c0f6d80da2cb293df8dbad1bfecdb2fd249c/0_99_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e7c630c1b0dc66bf205ce2e7d907292","title":"keir starmer declines to rule out campaigning to rejoin eu","story":"Labour leadership frontrunner was only candidate at Dudley hustings not to reject idea of reversing Brexit Keir Starmer, the Labour leadership frontrunner, has declined to rule out campaigning to rejoin the EU in the years ahead, saying it was a question for future generations.The shadow Brexit secretary said he did not think it was a “priority for now and the immediate future” and has previously said the question of leaving the EU is over.

He then turned the gun on himself. Dorothy, 35, had fled from him with their two daughters a few days earlier because Cotter had begun to hurt their 11-year-old, but she had refused the offer of a refuge. She told the police that if her daughters were with her, Cotter would find them, and kill all three. “She attempted to avert the worst of two terrible outcomes,” wrote the American journalist Rachel Louise Snyder in an article published in the New Yorker in 2013, “the loss of her daughters’ lives along with her own.”Snyder, 51, combines the forensic eye of the investigative reporter with her skills as a professor of creative writing but there is an added empathy. She explains that when she was nine, her mother died. Her father remarried two months later and became unstinting in his beatings to rein his daughter in. “Violence swirled around me,” she writes. It’s this personal experience that perhaps helps her to coax women, their families and the men who have abused and killed to speak out. “Patrick”, for instance, a retired federal official, middle-class, narcissistic, who murdered his daughter and wife and believes they will be waiting for him in heaven “with open arms”.Snyder also talks to the criminologists, public health workers, domestic abuse advocates, police and lawyers who are fighting to stop the harm – working in an arena that has its own unique frustrations and challenges. As Snyder writes: “Love is what makes domestic violence different from other crimes.”In September 1985, all four teenagers “were kicked out of the house”. Snyder dropped out of high school at 16. She worked as a waitress, living in her car. “The manageress let me sleep on her couch for a month. They were good people.” At 19, she says, “I knew the life I’d lived for the past three years would also be my life for the next 60 unless I got an education. On my mother’s side, I had an uncle who was a heart surgeon. Another had devised the TV show The Addams Family, my grandfather was a professor and a poet.”In 1988, Snyder, without any qualifications, presented herself to Rick Spencer, responsible for admissions and grants at her local university, North Central College in Illinois. “I knew she had been on a rough road but there she sat. That took guts. She still has that spark,” says Spencer, now vice-president of institutional advancement at the university. He gave Snyder her chance. “Two weeks into my first semester, I loved it,” says Snyder, now a tenured professor.After her studies, she became a foreign correspondent, reporting from more than 50 countries before returning to the US in 2010. Once she began investigating domestic abuse on her home patch, she says, she realised that here was a crime that linked many of the issues she had covered abroad including child brides in Romania and the forced sterilisation of women in Tibet. Across the world, 137 women are killed every day by familial violence. Domestic abuse, she writes, “is as common as rain”.No Visible Bruises was published in the US last year. Halfway through a national book tour last June, Snyder, flew home to Washington DC to attend her 11-year-old daughter’s fifth grade graduation. At the airport, she received a voicemail from a close friend, Michelle. “Something’s happening at Jason’s,” she said. Michelle’s brother, Jason Rieff, 51 and his wife, Lola Golumova, 45, both diplomats based in Washington DC were due to finalise their orce. Lola had been given custody of the two daughters and intended to take them overseas on a four-year posting. At 9.25 am on the morning of 7 June while the girls were at school, Jason – who had bought a gun 10 days earlier – shot and killed Lola and then shot himself. In the US, 50 women a month are shot dead (90 a month are killed in total) in familial violence.“I had to tell my daughter that her friend’s daddy killed her friend’s mummy, then killed himself,” Snyder says. Her daughter, Jazz, knew how death was delivered. “With a gun,” she said.I ask Snyder why she thinks the rates of killings and abuse are escalating. “The #MeToo movement calling out male behaviour has triggered a backlash,” she suggests. “Just because women are seen to be ‘winning’, though, doesn’t mean those men are ‘losing’. And, in Britain and the US, we have elected macho, misogynistic, authoritarian leaders that set a tone. The violent response has become increasingly normative.”Ten years ago, on her return to live in the US, Snyder met Suzanne Dubus and Kelly Dunne who worked at the Jeanne Geiger Crisis Center in Amesbury Massachusetts. Up till then, Snyder writes, she had always thought that domestic violence was, ”the unfortunate fate of the unlucky few”. She believed that restraining orders kept women safe that victims could easily leave a relationship if it became bad enough that courts punished men who were violent. Dubus and Dunne taught her otherwise.In 2002, they had tried to help Dorothy Giunta-Cotter, supporting her when she filed a restraining order on her husband, which he broke, and finding a room for her and her two daughters in a long-term shelter, which Dorothy refused. In the wake of Dorothy’s death, Dubus and Dunne were prompted to create the first Domestic Violence High Risk Team (now emulated in the UK and many other countries) to work out how to deal with abusive men more effectively. The team brings police, hospitals, courts, state legislature and other professionals together to share information and prevent domestic murder by intervening early. In Dorothy’s case, detectives had no knowledge of the times William Cotter had hospitalised his partner. “Communication between professionals is what makes a difference,” Snyder says.Drawing a timeline to identify a pattern of abuse as it unfolds, sharing the information among frontline collaborating professionals, is vital, Campbell stresses. In this way, an escalating pattern of control andor violence is revealed and understood as so much more than an isolated “accident”. Yet still, in the UK, according to Davina James-Hanman who reviews domestic abuse murders for the Home Office, scarce resources mostly go to high-risk cases, for instance where attempted murder is flagged up, and not to lower-risk cases where intervention much earlier in an abusive relationship gives the woman a chance to break free.Snyder says that after the deaths of Jason Rieff and Lola Golumova, among the first to send their love and support were the mothers of Michelle and Rocky Mosure. Michelle had had two children with Rocky before she was 18. Rocky appeared the perfect husband but he was also exercising coercive control over Michelle, a crime in the UK since 2015 but not in the US. But in 2001, aged 23, Michelle was breaking free. She had returned to education and had a restraining order on Rocky. He broke the order, Michelle went back to him. Snyder says women return for a variety of reasons, including their lack of finances, the paucity of protection, the fear. Soon after, Rocky shot dead Michelle, his two children and then himself.Does Snyder believe abusers can stop, turn themselves around? “Jimmy hasn’t abused for years,” she says. Jimmy Espinoza was a drug addict, pimp, rapist and serial batterer. He had also been sexually abused as a child. He became a group leader of a programme to help men desist from abuse. In the book, Snyder notices a poster on the wall at one meeting. “How do you persuade a 30-year-old to stop beating his wife? Talk to him when he’s 12.” “Across the board the violent men I met didn’t want to be violent,” Snyder says. “What they don’t know is alternative behaviours. They don’t understand that where there is greater equality in a relationship, it’s generally stronger and more satisfying.”She says that among the measures that may make a difference in tackling domestic abuse are better training for the judiciary and the police, constant analysis of risk, education in schools and innovative initiatives such as protected housing so a woman doesn’t have to uproot herself and her children and travel 200 miles to a refuge.Snyder wants to trigger an international debate about domestic violence and has her own ideas. She proposes an app to provide advice to teenagers distinguishing, for instance, stalking and harassment from “romance” and a helpline for men who want to stop the violence and control. (The UK has a call line, Respect.)When Snyder had her daughter, she was reconciled with her father and stepmother, Barbara. Close to death, Barbara revealed that she too had been a victim of domestic abuse in a previous marriage. The book is dedicated to her. Prevention, education and early intervention all matter but something far more fundamental and deep-rooted also has to shift because inequality and male power are at the root of this epidemic.“You have to take the longer view of history,” Snyder says. “Until very recently, for instance, it was legal for a man to rape his wife. I’m an optimist. I have to believe that change is possible.”• No Visible Bruises by Rachel Louise Snyder is published by Scribe (£9.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

Rachael Blackmore’s total involvement on day two of the 2018 Festival was riding in those canters at dawn before driving 100 miles east to Huntingdon for one mount, a winner in a handicap hurdle for lady riders.Such is the gritty reality for jockeys, most of whom would go a lot further than 100 miles if there was a winner at the end of it, however unglamorous the contest. But the Huntingdon trip, recalled by Blackmore’s friend and housemate Patrick Mullins, illustrates just how much the 30-year-old’s fortunes have changed.There is no question of her being anywhere else but Cheltenham this week. From her arrival on Sunday night until the last race on Friday, she will be close to the beating heart of the action, as Blackmore has an excellent book of rides in the best races, including the favourites for the Arkle Trophy and the Ryanair Chase. The days of toiling over to Huntingdon in pursuit of a prize of £4,000 are long gone.“She works very hard and there wasn’t a lot of reward for a long time,” reflects Mullins, son of Willie, the champion jumps trainer in Ireland. On the day of Blackmore’s excursion to Cambridgeshire, Mullins had a more enviable gig as jockey on the vaunted Douvan, well fancied for the Champion Chase. Since Douvan took a crashing fall, it could be argued she had much the better day, but all jockeys want to be wanted when the biggest prizes are on offer.Mullins recalls: “When I moved in with her and her boyfriend, Brian Hayes, myself and Brian would have been going racing most days. Rachael wasn’t. She used to do a lot of baking on those days – which was like her way of punching the wall.”The rolling pin doesn’t see so much action these days but, as Mullins remembers it, Blackmore’s baking was “too good. I used to spend a lot more time in the sauna back then”. An extra pound here or there is nothing to Blackmore, however, as she can readily weigh out at just nine stone.What made the difference for her was a conversation between others in the back of a Liverpool taxi just weeks after the 2018 Festival, when the trainer Henry de Bromhead was casting about for a stable jockey and Eddie O’Leary, one of his principal owners, mentioned Blackmore. Since then it seems hardly anything has gone wrong for the new team, who paired up for two winners at the last Festival and have been bagging Grade Ones for fun in Ireland this season.Blackmore’s life has changed. Having been worried that it was a mistake to give up her first plan of being a vet, she is without question the most successful female jockey Britain or Ireland has ever produced. She has been signed up as ambassador to the bookmakers BetVictor and has picked up other gigs outside the sport, like her role representing the luxury shopping outlet Kildare Village, bringing with it the fun of photoshoots. “Describing myself as a model might be a massive push,” she says, inclined to play down everything except her commitment to the day job.Reticent in talking about herself, Blackmore has a particular antipathy for questions about what it means to be a female jockey. Asked about the happy situation in which she finds herself, she says: “Henry’s got a serious class of horse now. I’m extremely, extremely lucky to be getting the opportunities on them. I’m just ready to get cracking at it now.”She seems happiest discussing horses, so we fall to considering her mounts this week, and immediately the fondness she feels for Honeysuckle, her Irish Champion Hurdle winner, shows up. “She’s very special. She was extremely tough at Leopardstown, to battle back after the last like she did. This is her first trip to Cheltenham and hopefully it goes well.” She runs in the Mares Hurdle rather than the Champion because the extra half-mile is reckoned to be a big help, though it means taking on the intimidating Benie Des Dieux.Captain Guinness (“One to keep an eye on”) starts the rider off in Tuesday’s Supreme, followed by that impressive jumper Notebook in the Arkle. He nearly blew his chance last time by bolting down to the start, which Blackmore is determined not to let happen again. “I’m just going to be more awake on him this time, more in anticipation of him doing that, whereas the last day I wasn’t expecting it.”Her winners from last year are both back. Minella Indo tries his hand at chasing in the RSA while A Plus Tard is expected to tackle the Ryanair rather than the Champion Chase. “The way he finished up the hill last year was unbelievable. I think he’s progressed since then.”Minella Melody in the Dawn Run and Aspire Tower in the Triumph have fairly obvious chances. Monalee, her Gold Cup mount, is further down the betting but Blackmore points out that the fancied Delta Work beat him by just a head last month.It could be a very big week for a jockey whose success has been thought-provoking for Mullins. “Her main asset is, she’s fantastic at getting horses to settle and she’s fantastic at getting horses to jump. Every time she’s got an opportunity, she’s taken it. Since she got in with Henry, she hasn’t missed, it’s been bullseye after bullseye.“I would have changed how I ride from watching her. I’ve probably gone from trying to give her advice to asking her advice. And it raises some questions. I was thinking about strength and Rachael is a nine-stone girl and yet she’s as good as anyone. You see her win plenty of tight finishes and you see her able to settle up strong horses. It’s changed the way I think about riding.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f291fb0019989aca718b3ccdb3264236e1087d1/16_187_2959_1775/master/2959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303430336ddb73713718b9953ddb34d3","title":"scotland france six nations match report","story":"France’s hopes of a first Grand Slam for a decade were ended by their own indiscipline and Scottish performance that blended defensive grit with attacking invention. An early yellow card for François Cros was followed in the first half by red for Mohamed Haouas and while those two losses did not make the defeat inevitable, they contributed to an out-of-sorts display at odds with the form that had produced three consecutive victories.Failure to pick up even a losing bonus leaves them level with England on 13 points at the top of the Six Nations table. They now have to pick themselves up for their home game against Ireland on Saturday night, while England have to await news on the rearrangement of their match against Italy in Rome.For their part, Scotland will travel to Wales with hopes of at least holding on to third place. Their win against Italy a fortnight ago was not seen as hugely significant given the modest nature of the opposition, but this was altogether more impressive. Unlikely as it sounds after their defeats by Ireland and England, a win in Cardiff would take them to the top and even if that lofty status were temporary it would provide compelling evidence of real progress after a difficult campaign without their playmaker Finn Russell following his falling-out with the head coach, Gregor Townsend.Sean Maitland will receive plaudits for his two tries – one either side of half-time – while Stuart McInally showed a poacher’s instinct to score later on off a misfiring lineout. Adam Hastings added his team’s other points with the boot, but the key ingredients of their success were the well-drilled defence that has been the most significant feature of this campaign and the indomitable will to win of Stuart Hogg, for whom this was a first victory as captain.France, who had to bring Peato Mauvaka on to the bench after Camille Chat was injured in the warm-up, lost Romain Ntamack to a head knock early on. They were deprived of Cros for 10 minutes for a dangerous tackle on Grant Gilchrist – although Paul Willemse seemed to be the real culprit – then worse followed for them close to half-time, when Haouas was sent off for punching Jamie Ritchie.A man down at the first scrum, France were penalised for not driving straight and Hastings opened the scoring with a simple effort from 25 metres. The stand-off added another, longer effort near the midway point in the half, but a moment of genius from Antoine Dupont put the visitors ahead with the scrum-half’s perfectly weighed punt being collected and touched down in the right corner by Damian Penaud. Mathieu Jalibert, Ntamack’s replacement, converted from the touchline.Scotland tried to counter immediately, but their momentum was halted when a brawl involving several players from each side broke out close to the France line. Haouas’s offence was the most blatant – at least after several reviews of the incident – and he was sent off for the right hook on Ritchie.Another penalty in front of the posts produced another three points for Hastings and Scotland and in the last play of the half Maitland added a try. Gilchrist made the initial opening as the defence was stretched to breaking point, Hogg took the attack on, then Sam Johnson put the winger in at the right corner. Hastings missed the conversion, but a 14-7 half-time lead against 14 men was an excellent position for the home team to be in.That became 21-7 five minutes into the second half with Maitland again touching down and Hastings converting. Hogg was the instigator this time, breaking from midfield after Hamish Watson had turned over a France attack and some slick passing involving Chris Harris and Ali Price ended up with Johnson again giving the winger the space he needed to score.The arrival of the rain made handling trickier and another France attack was stopped just short. A Jalibert penalty took them into double figures and briefly revived their chances of mounting a late recovery until McInally, just off the bench, scored. The hooker threw in poorly, but the ball bounced off a French lock, allowing him to collect and race clear from 20 metres out. Hastings converted and at 28-10 down France realised the game was up.Their captain, Charles Ollivon, got a score back five minutes from time, with Jalibert converting. Another try would have produced a losing bonus point and give France the edge going into the final round of fixtures, but it was Scotland who came closer to scoring in the dying moments of the match."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/563913c202987d5354183a726426bd55744adb37/0_259_4387_2632/master/4387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40a4bf352aeea02a6066113b91824ba7","title":"tyrrell hatton holds on for arnold palmer invitational victory","story":"“That” European Tour has delivered once again. A week after Paul Azinger caused an international incident with snippy comments about the ability or otherwise of Europe’s best players to prevail in the United States, Tyrrell Hatton offered the perfect response. On yet another gruelling afternoon at Bay Hill, Hatton claimed the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the biggest cheque – just short of $1.7m (£1.3m) – of his career. This marked the fifth win in succession of this tournament by a non-American three of whom are European. A penny for Azinger’s thoughts.Nobody can claim Hatton did this the easy way. The Englishman triumphed by a shot, at just four under par, after what developed into a battle with Marc Leishman. “Tyrrell never gave up,” said Leishman. “He did what he needed to do there.”Hatton had wobbled with a double bogey at the 11th, where shades of his old, petulant nature were visible. He found water off the tee and duffed a chip which didn’t make it to the green but steadied himself sufficiently to reel off seven pars from there. Hatton was bold when it counted his tee shot into the tricky par-three 17th was wonderfully nerveless. Leishman, 73 against Hatton’s 74, couldn’t keep pace.“It’s an incredible feeling to win at such an iconic venue,” said Hatton, who was playing in only his second tournament since wrist surgery. “I grew up watching this event on TV, to be sitting here with the trophy is amazing.” Hatton duly described his caddie, Scotsman Michael Donaghy, as a “national treasure”.Sungjae Im, who was a constant threat to Hatton, finished third at two under. Bryson DeChambeau, at minus one, completed only a quartet to break par. Keith Mitchell, Joel Dahmen and Danny Lee earned Open Championship spots courtesy of top 10 finishes.As Rory McIlroy birdied the 4th, thereby tying the lead, he appeared set for a meaningful tilt at the trophy he won in 2018. Instead, and strangely, he hit reverse gear from there. He bogeyed the 5th, hardly a disaster, but took seven at the par-five 6th. An opening nine of 40 – McIlroy whacked his tee shot out of bounds at the 9th – meant he required snookers to win. McIlroy remains a model of consistency and will shortly reach 100 weeks combined as the world No1 but falling short, naturally, will sting. His 76 left him four short of Hatton in a share of fifth.“I’ve had chances and I wish I had converted one of them over the last few weeks, but I’m still in good form. I’m playing some good golf. And hopefully if I just keep putting myself in those positions, it’s only a matter of time.”Matt Fitzpatrick, playing early, had an outside chance of taking the title when five under par for his round and one under in total by the 17th tee. A very costly double bogey followed for the Yorkshireman.His 69 meant a share of ninth and he can be counted among those who approve of the Bay Hill setup.“I would so much rather play it like this every week, where it’s a battle and you’ve got to go work hard and grind instead of wide open fairways,” he said.Brooks Koepka’s sentiment was more profound. The four-time major winner, short of form in 2020, signed off with a 71, 10 strokes fewer than on Saturday. So how would Koepka describe his golf? “Still shit,” he replied."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cad0d66c2a50b339cda038efbfbc2ce7522054ef/728_669_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2950355f36cd6d1eb9e214399cb3d9d9","title":"wigan hull kr super league match report rugby league","story":"Wigan returned to the top of Super League and underlined their early-season position as the team to beat, although they were given a stern test by an injury-hit, resilient Hull KR side. Two tries for the Man of Steel, Jackson Hastings, were among the five Wigan scored to see off the Robins but this was far from a straightforward afternoon’s work for the Warriors.Hull KR were without eight first-team regulars and several other key players were injured as the afternoon went on.It was much to the visitors’ credit that the Super League leaders never really looked comfortable until well into the final quarter.“These are the important games to win over the course of a season,” said the Wigan coach, Adrian Lam, after watching his side register their fifth win of the season.It took them until May in his first season in charge last year to reach that mark, underlining the transformation in fortunesunder his tenure.This victory swung on a number of pivotal moments. With the game finely poised at 12-12 in the minutes before half-time, a superb break from Bevan French led to a magnificent try finished by Hastings. From there Wigan led for the remainder of the game, despite stubborn resistance from their opponents.The quality from the likes of Hastings and French at crucial junctures was decisive. Earlier tries from Hastings and Liam Farrell had levelled the game after Ethan Ryan and Greg Minikin claimed deserved scores for the visitors. Injuries, however, contributed to Hull KR’s second-half downfall.“We had one fit player left on the bench for the final 30 minutes,” said Tony Smith, whose side remain in the early-season battle at the bottom. “I can’t question my players’ effort though we bent our backs and held our own against a very good team for large periods.”Lam rightly pointed out that this was a game Wigan may have lost last year, and when Ryan Brierley reduced their lead to just two an upset seemed plausible.However, with Will Maher and Joe Keyes leaving the field due to injuries, the Robins’ gameplan, and their resistance, unravelled.Tries from Sam Powell and Liam Marshall either side of the hour mark – both converted by Zak Hardaker – opened up a three-score lead and, in the end, this was always going to be enough to see off the Robins’ spirited threat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a4e37606f13189868ea3c5e29f4aec68f74d7f6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc6178045afff9bbc94e6647936137df","title":"sarcasm and sausages manchester comedians mancunians alternative comedy","story":"Amateur nights, ‘chaos energy’ and jokes about yeast … Our writer continues her UK comedy tour and discovers Mancunians’ appetite for the alternativeIt’s Manchester’s first ever Grubby Comedy night. The sold-out audience at the Red Bank Project, a recently renovated arts space, is ready to watch a lineup of local acts, including Edinburgh Comedy award-nominated sketch duo The Delightful Sausage, aka Amy Gledhill and Chris Cantrill.“We’re lucky to be in a city where there is this appetite for alternative stuff,” says Gledhill. Four years ago, Gledhill (originally from Hull) and Cantrill (Bradford) relocated from London to Manchester. The Delightful Sausage began as the name of their DIY comedy night, a precursor to Grubby. “One of us would dress up as a sausage and the other would dress up as a butcher,” Gledhill says. “It was mad, but really different.”That will be no surprise to anyone who has seen the pair’s hilarious show Ginster’s Paradise, a visit to a twisted British holiday camp, where silliness meets darkness as they “channel Brexit anxiety”, says Cantrill. When they first paired up, they were even more abstract. “A big part of our first show was yeast: there was a yeast businessman, we won some yeast, yeast could cure stuff,” Gledhill says. “We just thought yeast was funny.”Cantrill and Gledhill both do standup, but Manchester gave them the space to collaborate on weirder stuff. They soon met other alternative acts. Many had also created their own nights: Sham Bodie, an experimental mixed bill from John Stansfield and Ben Tonge Flim Nite, where performers create sets based on famous movies and offerings from some of Grubby’s lineup – character-heavy night Quippodrome with Jack Evans and Jain Edwards, and Jim John Harkness’s open mic Entertainment Club.Even if you’re baffled by experimental comedy, Manchester has something for you. The MEN Arena and Lowry theatre host TV-famous names, while the Comedy Store and the Frog and Bucket provide big weekend shows and amateur nights. Meanwhile, Toby Hadoke’s long-running XS Malarkey “bridges the gap between alternative DIY and glossy Saturday-night comedy,” Gledhill says.In Manchester, big names share bills with newcomers, says Bethany Black, who’s been doing standup in the city for two decades and grew up in nearby Chorley. “Really quickly you’d end up working with people you’d seen on telly.” A few gigs in, she’d played alongside Alan Carr and Jason Manford.Standup Rachel Fairburn grew up in north Manchester and began her comedy career here around 10 years ago with a course at the Comedy Store. She’s played pretty much every gig in the city, including “unsung hero” The Comedy Balloon – a weekly open mic run by Jason Cooke for 20 years. “The Manchester scene should big it up more because it’s always been good,” Fairburn says.Like any workplace, Fairburn says, the comedy scene has its politics – the community’s small enough that everyone knows everyone else’s business – but people like Cooke consistently support Manchester acts. At the Frog and Bucket, Jessica Toomey, who helps run Manchester’s Women in Comedy festival, recently took over from her dad, founder Dave Perkin, and has been ersifying lineups. “She’s booking more women, there’s lots more variation in acts,” says Black.Manchester’s universities have given the comedy circuit many graduates. Fairburn’s All Killa No Filla podcast co-host Kiri Pritchard-McLean and her sketch group Gein’s Family Giftshop went to Salford University, whose alumni include Peter Kay and Peter Slater. The tech comedy group Foxdog Studios are computer science graduates of Manchester University, where Joe Lycett and Lou Sanders studied.Others come here specifically for comedy. Grubby’s MC Sean Morley has travelled from Sheffield. Black praises “fantastic” new standup Tony Wright, who grew up in Kent but now does comedy here. She also reminisces about “Little Tyneside” – a house where Geordie comics lived together – and is currently writing a sitcom about her year in a grotty Manchester flatshare with four other comedians.“There’s no whiff of drama school,” Morley says of the local standup scene. “Comedy is still very much a working-class artform here.” Morley describes the “backbone of Manchester comedy” as being: “Everything’s a mess, but we’ve managed to get people together in a pub, so let’s make the best of it. It’s a roll-your-sleeves-up attitude.”Gledhill agrees: “‘Down to earth’ is probably the best way to describe it. There’s an honesty to it, less ego involved. We’re quicker to talk about gross or sad stuff, in a way that’s not sentimental.” Cantrill adds: “But with a rich seam of sarcasm.” Fairburn recognises this in her own standup: “You’re a bit sarcastic and you like taking the piss, but it’s always done in a way that is not offensive. When you grow up in Manchester, that’s the humour, you take the piss out of each other constantly.”Audiences here can make comedians work hard for laughs – which can be beneficial. “A lot of acts get very good at comedy very quickly, because the audiences tend to be tougher,” says Fairburn. Part of the skill comes from playing Manchester’s spectrum of nights: “If you can make all those different people laugh, then you’re a good comedian.”Many acts develop “an edge” from this, Cantrill says: “Once you’ve followed a meat raffle and people are tutting because they wanted a tribute act instead, when you do a gig that doesn’t go exactly how you want, you’re like, ‘This is easy!’”At Grubby, Morley guides us playfully through the night. He introduces Harkness’s character of a failing entertainer veering towards a breakdown, then Edwards’s pleasingly offbeat stand-up featuring a dog-less Crufts routine. Evans brings self-described “chaos energy” with his set, and Foxdog Studios link our phones to their projector for a finale of interactive musical comedy. The audience is in hysterics throughout. In Manchester, that must mean even higher praise than usual. This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6346c3364e9bbba868f2fb3a4ee9eb1e322117a/712_296_1042_625/master/1042.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bdc658a6bd8e065631f3e0a1d374a91","title":"its perfectly possible to make it on your own how women are building for the future in bangladesh","story":"From brick making to setting up shop, women are taking the lead in supporting their families in Barishal, helped by support and training funded by the British Red Crossby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalWhen Geeta’s father didn’t return home from fishing one day, she went looking for him in the brick kilns near their home in the Barishal region of Bangladesh. “Nobody knows where he went,” she says. “As children, we used to think he left to find a better job and forgot to tell us – but then he never returned.”This meant that at the age of 15, Geeta became the main breadwinner for her family. Running odd jobs here and there, making barely enough to get by, she was soon drawn to the cylindrical chimneys of brick kilns that punctuate the city’s horizon.Today, Geeta, 45, is a mason at the same brick kiln she wandered through as a child. She works from 9am to 5pm every day, earning 4,000 taka (roughly £36) a month. “At first the work was tiresome but now I’m used to it,” she says. Though her family continue to live in poverty, she is glad she is able to contribute towards their expenses and enjoys some aspects of the job. “Around here, the water washes everything away – so it feels good to be able to build things that last,” she says.“Sometimes the air here is difficult to breathe,” says Reshma, a single mother of two, as she weighs firewood outside her stall. After her husband left her, the monsoon destroyed her house, causing the thatched roof to collapse while she and her children slept. “It’s been one disaster after another,” she says.Now the sole provider for her children, Reshma also had to deal with the stigma of being a single parent. But focusing on pulling her family out of poverty meant she didn’t have time to think about what others thought, she says. Reshma soon began selling vegetables on the side of a road, but struggled to earn enough to feed her children. Silvery wisps of hair escape beneath the bright orange shawl she wears casually over her head. “My situation has aged me,” she says. “I used to be beautiful, but all this stress has taken its toll.”But after receiving livelihood training and financial support from the Red Cross, Reshma was able to start her own firewood business. Now she has her own secure shop space and has ersified to sell vegetables as well as firewood, ensuring a year-round income.“I wanted to find something I could sell continuously, not just by season. Selling vegetables only is a problem – if you have too much stock, it will rot if you can’t sell it. But firewood is something I can store and sell whenever people need it.” Since many families in her community use firewood for warmth, cooking and boiling water, her product is in continuous demand.Running her own business allows Reshma to juggle her workload with family commitments. “Before, I used to struggle to feed my sons and often couldn’t get home on time to breastfeed my youngest. Now I can set my own hours and be around to provide their meals. Because my income has doubled, I am able to buy proper food for my children.” Reshma also plans to use her income to repair her home, so she can better cope when the storms and monsoons come around.“People always ask me how long will you survive on your own? They think that without a man, a woman can’t survive,” says Reshma. “But I’m showing them there are other alternatives. That it’s perfectly possible to make it on your own.”And that’s what Amirjaan, at the age of 65, is doing. She yells as loudly as her lungs can muster banging a metal pan with a spoon as she walks along the winding, dusty roads of her small village in Palashpur, near Barishal. She’s calling out for all things old, broken and unwanted. Behind her she pulls a creaky, wooden cart filled with clutter biscuit tins, metal boxes, copper cups, a broken mirror.“People don’t realise the true worth of things,” she says with a grin and twinkle in her eye. But Amirjaan does – she runs a successful scrap metal business. Sitting on a straw mat, as pots and pans dangle above her head, Amirjaan sifts through the day’s findings, determining the value of each item.For a small, older woman, Amirjaan knows how to make a lot of noise and, despite her age, she regularly lifts materials in excess of 20kg. “How could I do all this if I wasn’t strong?” she smiles.Amirjaan begged for scrap metal and rummaged in the streets for whatever she could find. “I have suffered a lot.” But after receiving a cash grant from the Red Cross, Amirjaan was able to set up her own business.Not only does her work help clear the rubbish-strewn streets of Palashpur, but Amirjaan is also making a profit from recycling – and occasionally even discovers cast-away trinkets she prefers to keep. Proudly showing off a blue ring that adorns her middle finger: “Some things are too precious to me to let go of,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e24ea05872bfd8a3644a556868b0cd7c7afd226/0_0_2164_1298/master/2164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a07b160cecf8e4a912f8cc73876da7a","title":"my europe 27 things we love european union","story":"To celebrate Europe, writers in all 27 EU countries share a favourite place that evokes the spirit of their nationI often dream of the journey over the Taygetos mountains from the western coast of the Peloponnese peninsula to the town of Sparta. It’s a trip I’ve done many times, most recently with my family. You start by the beaches of Kalamata, where my daughter was born, and a mere 10-minute drive up a small winding road takes you into the mountains, with the white houses and sea below. This is the route Telemachus (Odysseus’ son) took to visit Menelaus and Helen, newly returned from Troy.It’s Greece, so these are proper mountains. The road crests at 1,600 metres, taller than Ben Nevis, and there is a Swiss chalet-style cafe here that serves good hot chocolate. We tend to stop a bit before, at the village of Artemisia, where the Theotokos taverna has a balcony overlooking a valley on one side and a spring on the other.Locals sell herbs and honey down by the spring and the waiters (the owner’s kids) fill up your jug from it. Just before Sparta is Mystra, the ruins of a Byzantine city (pictured). The top of its battlements is my favourite spot on Earth – mountains on one side, the white splash of Sparta on the other. All of history in one spot.Andrew BostockIt started with a mug. That was when I knew I’d been accepted into the fold at Capitano del Popolo, a bar and restaurant in the Umbrian outpost of Orvieto. I’d sought temporary refuge in the hilltop town after losing my job in Rome in 2016, and was soon enraptured by its charms. Capitano del Popolo quickly became my stomping ground, a convivial place to drink caffè latte from my personal mug – a gift from the wonderful owner and chef, Valentina Santanicchio – or enjoy one of her dishes, such as handmade pappardelle with wild boar ragù, while sitting on the terrace under an often-piercing blue winter sky and marvelling at the 14th-century palace across the square.Italy is brimming with history and culture, places to visit and things to do. Venice, Rome and Florence are itinerary staples, Orvieto less so. The town, with its imposing cathedral, fresh air, sublime views of the Umbrian countryside and friendships made, is now my number one place to escape to from Rome. I often describe Orvieto as a comfort blanket, which wrapped me in its warmth at a time when it was needed most.Angela GiuffridaThe Ostend seafront is one of the places in the EU to which the UK is (geographically) closest. This two-mile strip of Belgian coastline also offers one of the loveliest strolls in Europe. A five-minute walk from the railway station, the promenade starts with stalls selling fresh seafood and chips.Continuing west, the route passes seafront cafes, museums, belle époque houses, a modernist casino, the splendid Thermae Palace Hotel, a spooky sculpture in memory of the Ostendais artist Léon Spilliaert, and children pleased to be at a favourite Belgian beach. But it’s the sea itself that will keep you staring. A hypnotic expanse of water, shifting through black and white, with blue, green and gold reflections of the sky. You can’t see Margate on the British coast but it’s only about 65 miles away.When Charlotte Brontë arrived in Belgium in 1843, she wrote of her “prosperous and speedy voyage” from London Bridge Wharf along the north Kent coast and on to Ostend. Following the suspension of passenger services from Ramsgate 170 years later, there are sadly now no ferries to this windswept haven for passengers leaving England today. Thank goodness for Eurostar.Emily WaterfieldWarsaw’s Old Powązki cemetery captures better than almost any other place the essence of a continent that so readily defines itself in terms of its history. A resting place for generations of poets, writers and composers, the cemetery is most famous for its thousands of iron, bronze and stone tombs and sepulchral sculptures, as well as the chestnut trees, oaks and lindens that shelter you from the heavens above. But what captivates me most is the beauty and variety of the names of the great and the good of 19th- and early 20th-century Warsaw that lie below them.Many have wonderful foreign names that provoke nostalgia for a long-gone Poland that was genuinely multicultural: names like Paweł Pellizzaro, Henryk Leon Malhomme, Kazimierz Wolff-Zdzienicki, Wacław Malcolm-Morris, Matylda de Castellaz-Abramowicz. While others are, to me at least, simply glorious names in their own right: Fidelis Matuszewski, Jan Habdank-Stpiczynski, Karolina Semelman Neugebauer, Hipolit Flock and my own personal favourite, Felicjan Szmakfefer.Poland’s cemeteries are known for All Saints Day commemorations (1 November), when millions of Poles gather to lay candles on the graves of loved ones and national heroes. But I find the living’s habit of making the day about themselves can be irritating, and Powązki is best visited on a winter’s weekday afternoon, when you have only the dead for company – a perfect place to reflect on the future of a country and continent that refuses to rest in peace.Christian DaviesA defunct church is potentially an eerie place, but the former church of Absalon in Copenhagen’s hip Vesterbro district is always buzzing with life and laughter. In 2014, Lennart Lajboschitz, founder of the Flying Tiger retail chain, bought the building for £1.2m and exchanged the pews and altar for long tables, comfy sofas and a bar. Now around 700 people visit this community space every day: some come to enjoy a coffee, a chat and a game of backgammon or chess, others to work on their laptops.Every evening at 6pm up to 200 people gather in the main hall for a communal meal. At around £5 a plate, it’s an affordable dining-out option that attracts people of all ages and nationalities.Others come to attend one of numerous activities: yoga, tango lessons, quizzes, drag queen bingo, table tennis, dodgeball tournaments, bridge, life drawing, a writers’ workshop and crafts such as pottery and bookbinding. Some of these may also involve drinking Baileys … because, well, why not?Andrea BakI could spend all day on the Wuppertal Schwebebahn, a unique suspension railway system in Wuppertal. Which makes me a Schwebebahnliebhaberin (floating rail aficionado), a word as slinky as the monorail system itself, an elegant, airy, 13km engineering wonder which snakes its way through the Wupper valley (between Düsseldorf and Cologne), humming along the track between Barmen and Elberfeld, and must be one of the nearest experiences to flying.“Why drive, when you can float to work?” was the thinking at the turn of the 20th century, when commuter numbers were growing and construction work on it began. Industrialisation had caused the western German region to develop so quickly that there was no room for broader streets to take the increase in traffic, and so the decision was made to go high. Steel girder construction was all the rage at the time – Paris got its Eiffel Tower, Wuppertal its floating railway, complete with the strident green limbs that give it its height and majesty.The Kaiser and his wife took a ride on it in 1900, hence the Kaiserwagen (carriage 5) with its velvet upholstery and gold trimmings, which has since been restored and can be ridden at weekends. An even more famous journey was undertaken by a circus elephant called Tuffi, who was put on it as a publicity stunt in 1950 but panicked in the overcrowded carriage and plunged into the river Wupper below. She survived with only minor injuries, as did her story, which has been retold to German children ever since.Not only is it a pleasure to ride – ideally kneeling on a seat at the back looking out of the window on to city and river life below – but also very efficient, with a train running every four minutes and reasonably priced (€2.90 for an adult single, €7.20 for 24 hours). It remains the transport of choice for Wuppertalers, moving around 25 million passengers a year.Wuppertal is also home to the dance company of the late choreographer Pina Bausch, and the Schwebebahn features in the 2011 film Pina, Wim Wenders’ tribute to Bausch.Kate ConnollyIt’s not the tallest structure in Bulgaria. It’s not even the tallest TV tower in the country (that accolade goes to Rousse). But Kopitoto, or the Vitosha Mountain TV Tower to give it its official name, has defined Sofia’s skyline since the mid-1980s.Most people are quick to laud Kopitoto (which means “the hoof”) for the spectacular views it offers over the city – it stands at 186 metres (about double the height of Big Ben) on an outcrop of the 2,290-metre Vitosha mountain, around 20km from the city centre.As a sucker for brutalist architecture, I’ve always loved the sheer scale of this concrete marvel of engineering, which is hexagonal in shape – but with three of the six sides extended, it appears almost triangular. From the 1960s until the beginning of the 90s, there was a cable car that took you up the mountain. Now the defunct graffiti-laden terminus station, right next to the TV tower, attracts urban explorers. My only regret is that it doesn’t do tours. • Svetoslav Petrov, editor-in-chief of Boyscout in BulgariaThe lifeblood of the trendy Letná district, Bio Oko cinema is the perfect place to immerse yourself in Czech culture. When I arrived a decade ago, I was here all the time, devouring every Czech-produced movie I could, trying to get to grips with the country’s dark history and offbeat humour. But it’s far more than just a cinema, and the bar outside the deckchair-strewn auditorium is a great hangout. It’s ideal for a quiet espresso during the day, but in the evening it springs into life with hip locals spilling out from the tables all the way up the stairs, drinking craft lager and eating delicious homemade quiche.The walls are lined with old communist-era movie posters, and many of these original prints are available to buy at the Terry Gilliam-inspired shop, Terry Posters (in sister cinema Kino Svtozor), from as little as €6. Mark PickeringIt’s fair to say that a few years ago Douglas Street, in Cork’s south inner city, an area blighted by the ill effects of anti-social behaviour, did not have the best of reputations. Walk along it today, however, and the historic thoroughfare, just five minutes from the city centre, has significantly been transformed.At the western end is the oasis of Nano Nagle Place, a former convent that in 2017 was converted into a complex that celebrates the extraordinary life of the eponymous 18th-century pioneer of Catholic education. There is a museum, a garden and a “sustainable foods cafe”, the Good Day Deli, in an airy modern glass pavilion.At the eastern edge is the primary engine of the area’s positive change: Coughlan’s. An almost 200-year-old “backstreet old man’s bar” taken over by musician and creative force Edel Curtin in 2012, Coughlan’s – which with pure Cork perverseness is pronounced “CAW-lans” – has since become the award-winning best music venue in the country.The intimate listening room in the formerly unloved lounge bar has a total capacity of no more than 65 seated, and yet Coughlan’s has managed to attract star American singer-songwriters Anaïs Mitchell, Ryley Walker and Sarah Jarosz, and leading Irish musicians such as Lisa O’Neill, Glen Hansard, Lisa Hannigan and Mick Flannery.It’s like a major venue in a music-savvy friend’s sitting room, with the added bonus of – so Coughlan’s claims, and with some justification – the best pint of stout in Cork.Philip WatsonThe village of Pyrga lies between Nicosia and Larnaca in the east of Cyprus. It’s a pretty place, the sort that Peter Mayle might have settled in had Provence not got him first. As it is, Pyrga’s only claim to fame is that it is home to a remarkable stone building. It could be mistaken for an old storeroom, except the gothic detail above the door hints at something more special. This building is a medieval royal chapel.Inside, damaged but beautiful frescos look as if they have been transported from medieval France. They tell the story of the marriage of King Janus to Charlotte de Bourbon in 1411, and betray the fact that Cyprus was a medieval French kingdom. Its rulers were the Lusignans, cousins to the English Plantagenets and as the chapel’s garrulous caretaker will tell you, Queen Charlotte is an ancestor of the UK’s current queen.Cyprus has not always been comfortable with its medieval heritage. For some, celebrating this French period and subsequent Venetian rule undermines the claim that Cyprus is a Greek island. Yet the Lusignans and their heirs left some stunning monuments, which easily overshadow the Roman remains at sites like Kourion. Apart from Pyrga, Kolossi and Limassol have two of the most intact Crusader castles , and the capital, Nicosia, is encircled by massive Venetian walls.Most dramatic of all, in the middle of Nicosia, sits the huge 13th-century French gothic Cathedral of St Sophia, which was converted into the the Selimiye Mosque in 1570. For a lover of medieval culture like myself, these gothic churches – many of which have been converted into mosques or subsumed into Byzantine structures – make Cyprus an unexpected revelation.Michael Paraskos, novelist and lecturerTwo former railway sheds are now home to one of the most exciting cultural spaces in Luxembourg City, which is aimed at sharing ideas and fostering new talent. Built in 1877 to store steam locomotives, the Rotondes remained underutilised throughout the 20th century (one was a warehouse, the other a bus garage). A decade ago the ministry of culture started to renovate these national monuments to host cultural activities, reopening them five years ago.The Northern roundhouse now hosts exhibitions, lectures, dance, secondhand markets and other events. The Southern roundhouse is a dark, cosy bar that holds quiz nights, concerts and theatre performances. The building between them houses Radio ARA, where I work.Once winter is over, the outdoor courtyard is filled with pallet furniture and people drinking and eating – bankers, hipsters, mums, musicians – the place is a magnet for all types, like Luxembourg itself.Wendy Winn, radio presenterRiga is an architecturally eclectic place with an incredible variety of coexisting styles: you can see the finest examples of art deco, alongside brutalist Soviet architecture and neoclassical buildings. One of my favourite places to visit is Riga Central Market, a Unesco world heritage site on the banks of the Daugava a few hundred metres from the old town. It’s a wondrous blend of art deco and neoclassicism, and when it opened in 1930 it was recognised as not only the largest, but also one of the best marketplaces in Europe.The five pavilions are former zeppelin hangars, and beneath each cavernous ceiling is a specialist market selling vegetables, dairy, meat, fish and local specialities. Riga doesn’t have a historic cafe tradition like Paris or Vienna, but the place to meet artists and bump into writers or musicians is the Cafe Osiris restaurant, which has had a loyal clientele for 25 years. Owner Andrejs Žagars says: “It’s the only cafe that reflects part of Riga as it was at the beginning of the 1990s. This place ... is an authentic proof of the time when Riga was changing, when Latvia was changing.”With its simple yet refined menu, Cafe Osiris is one of my favourite places to eat in the city, and we’ve used it to host Riga Biennial dinners for visiting artists on many occasions.Agniya Mirgorodskaya, founding director of the Riga Biennial FoundationAs the Eurostar makes its way through northern France’s post-industrial heartland, passengers en route to Paris or Brussels just want to be on their way, which is a pity. In Roubaix, one of the grittier towns in a region once famous for its mines and factories, sits a jewel called La Piscine, an art deco swimming baths transformed into a museum. It doesn’t look much from the outside, but step into the pool hall, with its mosaic tiles and enamelled-brick showers, and the starburst stained-glass windows cast a magical glow over a collection of nude statues and sculptures from various artists and periods posed around the pool.When I visited for the first time, the museum was almost empty and the effect was breathtaking. The frozen figures look as if they’re about to take – or have just taken – a dip in the rippling water.There is more to La Piscine: its permanent collection, which has now been extended into a former factory next door, includes works by Giacometti, Rodin, Claudel and Picasso. But the pool hall alone is worth the visit. Get off the train at Lille and take the metro for 30 minutes to Roubaix. Paris and Brussels can wait.Kim WillsherUnlike most European capitals, Bratislava is not overcrowded. Even so, it’s hard to believe that, tucked just behind the Eurovea shopping mall, there’s such a relaxing, crowd-free spot. I discovered this Danube river walk when I was working in the city and would slip off at lunchtime to stroll beside the water and watch the ducks foraging for food. There are usually couples and colleagues picnicking along the bank, but it’s also dotted with great cafes and restaurants. My favourite is Primi, a chic, Mediterranean-style eatery that serves terrific sea bass and bowls of tasty gazpacho. I actually had my first date with my now husband here – it must have had a certain kind of magic.If you head over Starý most – a newly renovated pedestrian and tram bridge – the opposite bank offers an incredible view of Bratislava castle, especially dazzling at sunset. The “botel” and restaurant Dunajský Pivovar offers a good gawping spot, as well as some excellent Slovakian cuisine. For the complete Bratislava experience, order a plate of traditional halušky (potato dumplings with sheep’s cheese) and a summery pint of the homemade brew. Markéta HorváthováWay up north, surrounded by meadows and forests, the border between Sweden and Finland consists of lively rapids called Kukkolaforsen, part of the larger River Torne. The area has a long history of log-driving, war and smuggling, and four languages are spoken here: Swedish, Finnish, Sámi and Meänkieli – a minority language closely related to Finnish. Midsummer the sun is up all hours at midwinter it never rises.The tiny village of Kukkola is the unofficial sauna capital of Sweden. I warmly recommend a sweaty session in the village sauna, a large log cabin that can accommodate 65 fiery enthusiasts on three levels of long benches, heated by a large aggregate that holds 600kg of stone. Afterwards you can take a cooling dip in the stream, then head to the local inn for specialities like moose, gravadlax in a cup and coffee cheese with cloudberries.For a historic sauna experience, follow the river north a bit to the aromatic 300-year-old smoke sauna of Matkakoski – thought to be the oldest sauna in Sweden still in use. Nearby you can fish for whitefish and salmon and forage for berries and mushrooms. Jens Linder, chefVisitors are always impressed by Tallinn’s old town and fall in love with the local cuisine. But, when they venture out of the city they’re even more amazed by the open spaces, untouched nature, long empty beaches, and bus stops seemingly in the middle of nowhere.Estonia is small (about a fifth the size of the UK) and around half of the country is covered in forest, making it very easy to escape and not see another person. Approximately one-fifth is protected under its five national parks and nature reserves. A network of hiking trails crosses the country, quite literally off the beaten path. Lahemaa national park has a mix of forest, bog and seashore Kõrvemaa nature reserve is great for birdwatching and Soomaa national park is unique – it floods every year, so is only accessible by kayak.But my favourite national park is Matsalu, known for birdwatching – it is home to over 200 different species. In spring the trees come to life with the sound of thousands of birds chirping. The birdsong is indescribably beautiful it’s like a symphony and therapy for the soul. Like many Estonians, I have a country house that I escape to – mine is near Matsalu and has a hot tub and sauna for soaking in post-exploring.Kristina LuppBudapest has long been marked by grand cafes, pastry shops and, above all, by the Danube flowing between the steep hills of ancient Buda and the expensive villas of Pest on the other side, comprising a wild profusion of building styles.In the heart of Pest there is a small interior courtyard: 10 Magyar utca.You can cut through it by day, proceeding through the quiet Magyar utca gate, stepping over silent wooden cobbles, to the busy Múzeum körút. Built by Miklós Ybl in 1852, four years after the failure of the 1848 revolution and 15 years before the establishment of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the courtyard is an eclectic, beautifully proportioned, faintly Venetian blend of classic and romantic.Much of Budapest is empire grandeur under bombardment. This is not. There are spaces that hold you through colour, air, texture and proportion. The first time you see Giotto’s Pazzi Chapel in Florence, you feel it.If Budapest has a humane soul, it is something like this. You breathe differently here. You hope for more. George SzirtesOne of my favourite places in Bucharest is the National Museum of Contemporary Art (MNAC). It was here that I discovered avant-garde Romanian art, which has flourished ever since the 1970s, when dictator Nicolae Ceausescu stopped imposing the socialist-realist style.The museum is in the neoclassical Casa Poporului, or the Palace of the Parliament, the second-largest government building in the world after the Pentagon and the embodiment of Ceausescu’s ego and ambition: building it required an entire neighbourhood of about six square kilometres to be bulldozed and 57,000 families relocated.Getting to the museum is an adventure in itself, especially if you’re wearing high heels, as it’s a walk of a good seven minutes from the gates to the entrance.It’s not just the contrast with the totalitarian undertones of the Palace that sets MNAC apart. On the top-floor terrace of the museum, you can enjoy a glass of lemonade or an occasional gig, and take in the best view of Romania’s isive new People’s Salvation Cathedral, which cost the country about €400m. Paula ErizanuHook of Holland is an odd place to love. Go there and look south, and you’ll see one of the densest concentrations of industry in Europe: giant cranes, chimneys smoking like upturned cigars, and massive cargo ships rumbling their way from the Rhine into the North Sea. Yet head north and you’ll see something different: an arc of empty white sand stretching for miles. On a sunny day, you could almost be in Thailand.The appeal lies partly in the beach’s beauty, but also in the way it captures the spirit of the Netherlands: beautiful but industrious, peaceful but dynamic. It’s a crossroads where culture and history have always blended, like ingredients in a cocktail.I first came to the Hook a decade ago, soon after I moved to the Netherlands, when I lived just up the coast. Later, my wife and I were married in the sand dunes. Now, I come here often with our little daughter and watch her play in the waves. Sitting on the sand with a plate of fresh fish, we’re nearly as close to Essex as Maastricht. Britain feels tantalisingly close, yet also very far away.Ben Coates, author of The Rhine: Following Europe’s Greatest River from Amsterdam to the Alps (John Murray Press, £9.99)If you’re a wise enough traveller to know that Slovenia is well worth a visit, then you’ll be sure to see the delightful capital, Ljubljana, and will doubtless head off to fairytale Lake Bled, dolloped by a church-topped island and with a Grimm castle looming on a clifftop above it.The question, then, is: what else you should see, beyond the Big Two attractions? My favourite place in my adopted homeland is the medieval town of Kamnik. Once a far more important city than Ljubljana, it was the feudal stronghold of the Bavarian Andechs clan, who made it a stop on trade routes between Budapest in the east and Venice to the west.Today the town boasts three castles, hiking trails close to the centre, an important rare books library, rich industrial heritage (the KIK factory here once produced much of the gunpowder for the Austro-Hungarian army and the Stol factory exported Thonet rocking chairs to the US), and may have the most microbreweries per capita in the world (six for a population of around 10,000). At the foot of the Kamnik-Savinja mountain range, it is also an ideal gateway to the sunny side of the Alps, a 10-minute drive from the Velika Planina mountain plateau , the closest you’ll get to Middle Earth in Middle Europe. Noah Charney, author of Slovenology: Living and Traveling in the World’s Best CountryMy favourite place in Vienna – and indeed in Austria – is one that conjures up the most vivid image of the former multi-ethnic and multilingual western half of the Habsburg empire: the chamber of the former House of Commons (Sitzungssaal des Abgeordnetenhauses) in the old Imperial Parliament (Reichsrat). It’s largely unused since the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918 (except for the swearing-in of the president) miraculously, it also escaped wartime bombing.What is splendid and moving about it, aside from its size, beauty and sense of history, is the fact that representatives from almost all parts of the empire gathered there from 1883. German speakers from Austria itself and also from Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Carniola and Bukovina, as well as Czechs, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Italians, Romanians and even one member of the Jewish National Party, all elected on the basis of universal male suffrage after 1907, met in this chamber. For all the linguistic chaos and political isions, the riotous and boisterous filibustering, the subterfuges and boycotts, it somehow functioned as the world’s first multinational parliament.In 1918 it became redundant and the inidual nations went their own way, leaving the leaders of the new Austrian Republic too few to fill the former Imperial Chamber. Subsequent decades saw conflict between many of the nations that had been part of Austria-Hungary, culminating in the Balkan wars of the 1990s this chamber is reminiscent of gentler times, when all nations of the monarchy – no matter their disagreements or even hatreds – were able to contain themselves in a usually civilised arena rather than resort to violence.The modern-day EU parliament, with its 705 MEPs representing 27 countries, is perhaps its heir, though it lacks its magic and gravitas.At the moment, the Imperial Parliament building is closed for rebuilding and refurbishment, and will remain so until 2021. The glorious former House of Commons chamber itself will undergo a mere clean-up and a few repairs, and will return to its full splendour.Christopher BrennanMO museum, which opened in October 2018, changed everything in Vilnius. Not only is it an incredible place for Lithuanian modern art, it’s also an example of new-wave Lithuanian philanthropy. The museum was funded by two Lithuanian scientists and designed by architects at Studio Libeskind. It’s a striking building, at the intersection of the old town and the city’s more recent westwards expansion.MO museum recently had a wildly successful exhibition called The Origin of Species: the 1990s DNA. I went four times, because it really was a way to relive our recent history – the wild 1990s, the starting point of capitalism in Lithuania, the foundation of our modern, democratic state.You could relive experiences such as trying on new jeans in winter while standing on a piece of cardboard in Gariūnai (the infamous open-air market 20 minutes outside Vilnius) buying one cigarette from a kiosk and watching movies on a VHS player.There are permanent exhibitions of Lithuanian modern art as well – my favourite painter is the postmodernist Šarūnas Sauka. The museum also has a boutique cinema, a cafe and a small shop full of great Lithuanian art, jewellery and books. At the moment, preparations are being made for a huge exhibition showcasing the works of cult British film director Peter Greenaway. Artificial rain is said to be part of the show’s experience. Neringa RekasiuteTwo or three times a week for the past 18 years, I have shopped in Barcelona’s Santa Caterina market. It’s a social event as much as a shopping expedition and not somewhere you can go in a hurry because there are always updates on children, illnesses, operations and deaths to be discussed. It has a very Mediterranean, familial vibe.I often have breakfast in the market bar, Bar Joan, a family affair run by Joan and his sons and daughters. They know their customers well and no sooner do I pull up a red vinyl stool than one of them is fixing me a café con leche and calling to the kitchen for a bikini (toasted ham and cheese). They also make a fine tortilla de patatas.One morning I sat next to a man who breakfasted on tripe and beer followed by a carajillo (coffee with a splash of cognac). Spanish men of a certain age often kick off the day with a hit of booze, frequently red wine. Even after living here for 20 years I can’t imagine drinking wine at 8am, which is probably just as well.Stephen BurgenIn Malta’s capital city there are more than 25 churches displaying incredible baroque paintings and architecture. In the oratory of the church of the Order of St John, which is a true gem of high baroque, there is a painting that I really admire and always moves me: Caravaggio’s Beheading of St John the Baptist.Included in the ’s list of the 10 greatest works of art ever, and once described as “the painting of the 17th century”, it is as alive now as it has ever been, and with a message that is still relevant: life and death, youth against old age, the contrast of colours, with light and dark captured by the astounding chiaroscuro technique of the eccentric genius. It reveals not only the story but the very self of the artist, and engulfs the observer in its theatrical action, sparking our emotions too.There are many historical sites to visit in Valletta – the Grand Master’s Palace, Casa Rocca Piccola (a “living” 16th-century palazzo), the Malta National Community Art Museum – but Caravaggio’s masterpiece is the one I always come back to. A visit to the cathedral and its oratory is by far the highlight of the Valletta experience.Fra Nikola Soukmandjiev, diplomat, priest and tour guideThe air is heavy with the scent of wild rosemary, sage and pine as I cycle along the path that skirts Lošinj’s north-western headlands.They call Lošinj “the island of vitality”, and this is more than mere marketing guff. Wild herbs blanket this long, spindly island that dangles into the Kvarner Gulf south of Rijeka, and the smell of them instantly gives me a lift during my meandering bike ride through the pines.Every now and then I park my bike and plunge into the impossibly clear water. I love the fact that the beaches that ring Lošinj are – like most of those in Croatia – pebbly rather than sandy. Some of them take a bit of effort to reach, usually involving a long hike down a rocky trail, if you don’t have your own boat.This all adds to the rough-and-ready ruggedness you get away from the big beach resorts. Simplicity is the key, and you can taste it in the grilled fish served at waterside restaurants and the giant rounds of bread baked under a cast-iron bell.It’s this gentle assault on all the senses that I appreciate every time I go to Croatia’s Adriatic coast – from the vivid blue-green of the sea to the heady fragrance of herbs and pine that have been baked in the heat. Total bliss.Mary NovakovichWhen democracy returned to Portugal in the spring of 1974, the Portuguese celebrated by throwing themselves into building a “modern” nation state (with the aid, later, of EU funding). While I love the bright lights and cosmopolitan vibe of Lisbon and Porto, it is the vestiges of “old” Portugal that really enchant me. To find them, just step into any neighbourhood pastelaria (cafe-bakery). You’ll find the day’s newspaper on a table, the footie on the TV and friends shooting the breeze over average-tasting but cheap (less than €1) café expressos.In Portugal, pastelarias double as repositories of local pride. Aside from the ubiquitous pastel de nata (the famous creamy custard tart, now available in M\u0026ampS), every self-respecting Portuguese town boasts its own speciality sweet. Cernache do Bonjardim has its almond cartuchos (shells) Castro Daire its bolo podre (literally, “rotten cake”) Chaves its meat-filled pastel. My favourite is the sugary, eggy palha (straw) sweet from the historic city of Abrantes in the centre of the country. For the real deal, head to Confeitaria Palha de Abrantes on the main square: Portugal, in a single bite. Oliver BalchThe Midnight Sun Film Festival, established in 1986, enjoys a stellar reputation among cinephiles and moviemakers. A true celebration of the craft, the five-day festival skips the red carpets and invites the audience and acclaimed international directors to the small village of Sodankylä, in Finnish Lapland, to enjoy the round-the-clock feature film screenings each June, when the sun blazes above the horizon day and night.The programme ranges from premieres and rarities to classics and oddities, from silent films to karaoke singalong shows in a former circus tent. The morning discussion sessions with directors are a much-loved tradition, but not everybody makes it to those – the price of wrecking one’s circadian rhythm with high doses of sunshine.The laid-back atmosphere and lack of hierarchy encapsulate something of the Finnish propensity for happiness (Finland has topped the world’s “happy league” for the past two years). At an intimate festival whose whole ethos is to celebrate a love of cinema, one feels comfortable sharing a drink, a story or even a sauna with a random film buff or a world-famous film director – former guests include Francis Ford Coppola, Mike Leigh and Terry Gilliam.

If the bill passes with a two-thirds majority, it will then go to the Senate for further debate.The Alabama Board of Education in 1993 voted to prohibit yoga, hypnosis and meditation in public school classrooms. The ban was pushed by conservative groups, and some schools have reported complaints from parents who say the practice endorses a “non-Christian belief system”.The Alabama yoga ban got new attention in 2018 when an old document circulated listing yoga – along with games like tag and “duck, duck, goose” – among activities deemed to be inappropriate in gym class, according to the board.The ancient practice of yoga has its roots in Hinduism, though it is now a common form of exercise practiced across the world, including in private gyms in Alabama.“It’s something that, as athletes, have adopted as a culture,” Gray, who is a former college athlete and has taught yoga, said. “It also helps me with my discipline and being able to focus and to accomplish my goals.”Gray’s bill was also introduced at the end of the last legislative session but failed to gain tractionGray’s bill seeks to dissociate yoga from its religious roots, and says that local school systems can decide if they want to teach yoga poses and stretches. However, the moves and exercises taught to students must have exclusively English names, according to the legislation.

What they wanted was someone without kids who had a lot of energy to keep up with him because he’s a huge dog. But he’s still a puppy.”The billboard was paid for by Scott Poore, owner of Mission Driven, a Kansas-based clothing company that gives financial support to shelters for homeless pets.“It’s unbelievable it was this hard of a process,” he said. “We were telling the same story to the same audience for those five and a half years but when Mission Driven bought the billboard we reached a whole new audience.”Staff at the shelter threw a farewell party last week for Merrick, who is enjoying the freedoms of his new life by running around the large yard and drinking from the toilet.Nussbaum reported that Merrick has also taken a liking to a female dog that lives next door.He has also become a social media star in his own right, the Facebook page Merrick the Rescue Pup amassing more than 2,200 followers in its first few days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08537c694897e338f25ec797aa3079eae5599d8e/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cebec40b724c1d5825bd84cb45449ae","title":"kamala harris endorses joe biden","story":"Endorsement follows former presidential candidates Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Mike BloombergJoe Biden’s campaign for the White House received another significant lift on Sunday when Democratic senator Kamala Harris, until recently one of the former vice-president’s main rivals for the party’s presidential nomination, announced her endorsement.In a short video statement released on Twitter, Harris promised she would “do everything in my power” to ensure Biden beats off a challenge from Vermont senator Bernie Sanders for the nomination and goes on to be elected president in November.“I am with great enthusiasm going to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States,” the California senator said. “I believe in Joe. I really believe in him and I have known him for a long time.“One of the things we need most now is a leader who really does care about the people and who can therefore unify the people.”Biden, she said, was a public servant who had “always worked for the best of who we are as a nation, and we need that right now.”Harris’s support means that Biden, whose faltering campaign for the nomination was restored by a remarkable Super Tuesday turnaround, goes into Tuesday’s primary contests in a number of crucial midwest and western states, including Michigan and Missouri, with the backing of almost all of the key figures previously running against him.Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar dropped out last weekend and threw Biden their endorsements just before 14 states went to the polls on Super Tuesday.Billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, suffered a disappointing Super Tuesday and withdrew on Wednesday after spending $500m on his campaign. He immediately offered his backing and resources to the Biden operation.Meanwhile Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Massachusetts senator who dropped out on Thursday, has yet to announce an endorsement, with Sanders hoping she will swing her supporters to him.The Vermont senator, 78, also picked up one notable endorsement on Sunday, that of Jesse Jackson, the veteran civil rights leader who won the Michigan caucuses in his unsuccessful 1988 run at the Democratic presidential nomination.“A people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path,” Jackson said in a statement. “The most progressive social and economic path gives us the best chance to catch up and Bernie Sanders represents the most progressive path.”Harris, once seen as a likely frontrunner, ended her own campaign in December after struggling for months to overcome low opinion poll numbers. In a tweeted announcement to supporters she said running for president had been the “honor of my life” and promised to “keep up the fight”.Harris has previously been severely critical of Biden, notably during a contentious debate in July last year when she attacked his record on race relations. Biden, she claimed, worked with segregationist leaders in southern states during the civil rights era and supported “busing” of school children to achieve racial integration, claims Biden strenuously denied.Biden, after his extraordinary Super Tuesday turnaround, holds a narrow advantage over Sanders in the chase for Democratic delegates who will decide the nomination at the party’s convention in Milwaukee in July.The former Delaware senator and Barack Obama’s vice-president for eight years, has so far secured 664 of the 1,991 state delegates he needs, with Sanders – who raced out to an early lead after victories in Nevada and New Hampshire, has 573.On Tuesday a further 352 delegates are at stake in primary votes in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0423aab395e588566738a55caff1665d0c06d2a/0_0_2743_1646/master/2743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859c5cd1b667f5bf12ceb9a64db043e3","title":"tell us how is coronavirus affecting your day to day life","story":"We want to hear about how coronavirus has impacted your daily life.

Is it possible to bury the political hatchet?A bigoted old bastard: that’s how Letitia Clark thought of her dad, Tony, when she found out he had voted to leave. She worked in a restaurant, where many of her colleagues were EU migrants, and was dating an Italian. “He disappeared for a while,” she says of her father. “I think it was a wish to avoid conflict.”The vote played a significant role in Letitia’s decision to move with her then boyfriend to Sardinia, where she still lives and has written a cookbook, Bitter Honey, about Sardinian cuisine. She and her two brothers – a journalist in Cape Town, and a captain in the Royal Marines who travels all over the world – lead very different lives from Tony’s in quiet, rural Devon.Tony gets a good shoeing over Brexit whenever they see each other, most recently at Christmas. “We have so little time together as a family anyway, it seems a shame to focus on the things we don’t agree on,” Letitia says. Tony, 70, agrees: “I would never actually fall out with family or friends about it. You shrug your shoulders and get on with it.” He and his daughter share an inability to take themselves too seriously, and clearly love each other very much.Yet we all have to live together on these little islands, so how can we begin to find a way forward? What strategies are people using to address conflict with loved ones?Laughing about it has helped James, 32, from Maidstone, defuse conflicts that arose as a result of his leave vote. Most of his friends voted to remain. “It’s usually in the pub. Some of them take it personally, like I’ve attacked their sense of being, when I really haven’t. I decided to vote that way because I didn’t think there was any accountability in Europe,” he says. He found social media especially hard. “I was called an idiot, a racist, and accused of not knowing what I’m talking about. I don’t mind if you disagree with me, but it was the language used.”Then, about a year ago, a girl he had been talking to on a dating app ghosted him because he had voted leave. “All my friends, even my remainer friends, found it hilarious. That sort of brought us together. You get some perspective, realise that politics isn’t the be-all and end-all,” he says. James says the election did momentarily reignite tensions. “Now, when I go out with friends, we have a no-politics rule. It has got a lot better. They have been a lot less argumentative now that Brexit has happened.”Olivia Whelan, 38, from London, has reached the “resignation” phase: “I can’t have the same argument over and over with people.” Having studied in Germany and worked there for a decade, she was dismayed by the result and by the fact that her parents – who had lived in Spain for seven years – voted to leave. “When I found out, I was very upset. I found it very difficult for that whole first year to talk about anything else, especially with my dad, who had told my mum how to vote.”But she has come to understand her parents’ reasons for voting leave. “They really did think there would be that £350m a week for the NHS.” She is now, “amazingly”, dating a man who voted leave, which she says would have been unthinkable 18 months ago. They first went on a date in 2017, but ended up screaming at each other about Brexit. “I felt quite sad. I was still so angry and all I could see was that, if you voted for that, you must be terrible, your politics must be terrible, you must hate this country. I couldn’t see past it at all.”Has Olivia been through a grieving process of sorts, and come out the other side? “Yes, life has to go on. We have to find a way to live together after this.” Whether the harmony with her parents and her partner will continue, she doesn’t know. It depends what happens politically. “It’s calm at the moment, but if things get hairy again, I’m going to find it quite difficult.”Alison, 75, a British citizen who lives in Portugal, doesn’t know anyone else in her community of expats who voted to leave and, while her husband didn’t vote, he was pro-remain. “I was subjected to a constant barrage of criticism,” she says. “I frequently felt bullied, sidelined and isolated. I love Europe. I’ve always travelled in Europe. It’s the EU I don’t like.”Things have calmed down a little since the election, but it is clear from talking to Alison that she is still hurt. “I can stand up for myself and make my reasons known. But if you’re totally alone in that argument with no support from anybody else, it’s intimidating.”What about her husband? “We argue every time we watch the news,” she sighs. “You can’t orce your husband because of different political views. We’re fine.” It doesn’t sound fine – how does she think things will progress? “I’m not sure. We’re in a bit of a limbo at the moment. I think more war could break out.”There’s something particularly British about many of the stories I heard from families trying to resolve Brexit conflict, after a callout on the  website. Many of them were simply burying it. Does banning politics as a conversation topic simply repress negative emotions until a later date? Or does it allow people the time and space to focus on what unites them?One person struggling with a politics moratorium is James Turner, 41, from Buckinghamshire. James, who voted remain, and his family live close to his wife’s parents and siblings, and their families, who all voted leave. Brexit sparked conversations that shook his understanding of the people he thought he knew. “I couldn’t believe how emotional I found it,” he says. “When that leaks into family dynamics, it’s really hard.”A lack of communication following several disagreements has left James second-guessing his own feelings. “It occurred to me that it might not even be an issue to them, they might not have even realised how much it has affected me,” he says. This isn’t simply a difference of opinion, though, but extreme right ideologies. What would help James move forward? “Just a conversation that would go a long way to making me feel better about it. I’ve tried so hard to make that happen. But everyone seems terrified of engaging.”Ana, 43, lives in London, and is Spanish-Italian. She has lived in the UK since she was 15, when her anglophile parents sent her to study. She stayed, marrying a Briton who had been raised in Spain, and they have two children, aged eight and 12. When her mother-in-law and husband voted for Brexit, she felt betrayed. “I feel Brexit has been a validation for people expressing anti-immigration feelings,” she says. Pete, 37, who is British and lives in Germany, wept at the Brexit result – voted for by both his parents and their respective partners. It sent him down a long and stressful path towards German citizenship. He became snappy and withdrawn with his mother. “I resented her for what I saw as her supporting people who were working against my way of life, causing chaos for my friends and family, and stripping people in Britain and in the EU of important rights,” he says. What helped was channelling his energy into remain causes and working on his own responses. “I have made personal efforts to change my thinking, and I have the impression she has, too. I am lucky that both my parents are still here, and I want to have enjoyable times with them, and appreciate the good things about our relationship.”Simon, 48, from Solihull, was the first in his family to go to university. He voted remain. He told me how his Brexit-voting father had called him a “liberal elite” and he had called his father “a fucking stupid builder” during years of beer-fuelled arguments in the pub. “For a while, I was using all the hard data. I’d print out arguments with experts and statistics. He’d look at them, but it took me years to realise that it wasn’t the data that was going to change his mind. He hadn’t used reason to get to that position he just wanted out.”What was a logical question to him, Simon realised, was an emotional one for his dad. “It became clear that we were on different wavelengths. If your criteria are completely different then you could be speaking a different language.” But, Simon says, it would never have got to the point where father and son stopped speaking.When Simon wrote to me in January, his father was very ill he died before the month was out. Despite their political differences, the men were close. “As I used to say, ‘Dad, you are a complete arse but I love you.’ Him being ill crystallised the whole thing: some things are more important than politics. Ultimately, this is just an argument in the pub – it’s not going to change how we feel about each other.”Some names have been changedWe tend to make presumptions about the wider set of values other people hold on the basis of one or two that are salient. This is particularly evident post-Brexit. People assume that a person’s stance on Europe is a reliable indicator of all sorts of other values, often negative. Healing requires recognising the complexity of our value systems, and that holding a single view you find intolerable is consistent with holding any number of other values you share.Julian BagginiI usually prefer to avoid seeing a orce as a place where you win or lose. As a lawyer who deals with matters involving a high level of emotions, my number one priority is to keep my clients focused on the desired outcome, instead of seeking cheap wins and ego boosts. In the context of Brexit, the comparison should be that of a orce with children, where the best interest of the child should always come first. It is my job to help people see beyond the emotional hurt and seek common groun1d on which to build a future for themselves, unburdened by past hurts, as well as for their children. With Brexit, things are similar: accepting the new reality, and finding common ground with those who have chosen a different path to the one we would have preferred, is the only way forward.Rakhi SingalIf you’ve fallen out with someone over your views on Brexit, and want to get your relationship back on track, talk – ideally face-to-face. Say you know you have had your differences recently, but you’re still familyfriendspartners and your relationship is important to you. You don’t have to come round to their way of thinking, but you will need to agree to disagree and draw a line under it. If the other person is ready to move forward, try talking through some of the things that you do agree on, and looking back at some of the good times you’ve shared. Keep in mind that you are two different people with unique perspectives – it’s just that the polarisation around Brexit has made these differences more visible. Difference can be a good thing – it’s how you manage it that counts.Peter Saddington, at RelateGet perspective: trying to understand where someone else is coming from is tough but helpful. Try to see things through their lens. If you can understand their starting point, you will be in a better position to come up with solutions that give them some of what they want. This is critical to being able to move forward – if you are offering them nothing, don’t expect them to agree. Learn what triggers negative reactions in you – is there a specific point of disagreement that winds you up? Whatever it is, identify it and practise staying calm when thinking about it, or experiencing it.

But it’s the children the doctor remembers most.“There was a boy, about nine years old, brought in by his parents with terrible injuries. Part of his head was missing and he was bleeding from his ears,” she said.“It was obvious there was nothing we could do for him, but his heart kept beating and he kept breathing for hours. It was torture for his parents because we all knew he could not live. In the end they wanted me to give him something to help him die. At that point, I just collapsed. I couldn’t help him or them.”Ballour, 33, whose work at the hospital is the subject of the Oscar-nominated documentary The Cave, has many such horrific stories, which she says continue in Syria even as we speak.Since 2011, 500,000 Syrians have died in the country’s bitter civil war and more than five million have been displaced, many into exile. Ballour is now one of them, living in Turkey, but still haunted by her work in eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held suburb of Damascus that was besieged for five years and pounded with bombs, rockets and chemical weapons. The UN has classified the siege – considered the longest continuous blockade in recent history – a war crime.In recent months Russian warplanes, part of a military alliance with Syria’s leader Bashar al-Assad, have regularly attacked the rebel-held area of Idlib, bombing civilians, hospitals and schools in violation of international law.Last week, after clashes between Turkish forces who back opposition rebels and Russian-backed Syrian forces left 200 soldiers dead and dozens of civilians including children killed or injured, a fragile ceasefire was brokered between Ankara and Moscow. Observers say it is unlikely to last. For Ballour it has to hold. The violence, she said, must stop.Sitting in a Paris cafe last week, Ballour had come straight from a meeting with French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. She had been in Belgium days earlier and is travelling to Geneva this weekend, then on to the US, to plead with European and American leaders to put pressure on Russia, and to ask for increased humanitarian aid in Syria and for the thousands fleeing the war. Not just concrete measures, but empathy.“I ask people in Europe to remember refugees are human beings. They have a right to be safe, to live. These people don’t want to leave Syria. I didn’t want to leave, nobody wants to leave. We all just want to survive. When I can, I will go home,” she said.Ballour’s parents remain in Syria, in fear of reprisals because of their daughter’s high-profile defiance of the regime. But they have become used to her challenging their traditions and expectations.As a child, Ballour, the second youngest of a family of four girls and two boys, railed against not being allowed to ride a bike like her brothers, and refused to be married at 13 like her eldest sister. Her ambition was to study engineering, but her parents disapproved, insisting it was no job for a woman. They finally agreed she could study medicine at Damascus University.“It was expected that I would get married and have children. My father would tell us girls: ‘What good is a degree in the kitchen?’, but I was top of the class at school and I wanted to do something. My dream was to graduate, have a clinic and help children,” she said.By 2012 – a year after the civil war began – Ballour had completed her general medical studies and was specialising in paediatrics but abandoned the course to treat patients at the east Ghouta hospital. When the air raids intensified, pounding nearby buildings to rubble, the hospital was forced to operate from a maze of underground rooms and tunnels.Four years later, when she was still just 29, staff voted to appoint Ballour hospital manager in charge of the remaining 100 employees, including one surgeon and a handful of doctors, most of whom were students. Drone footage taken between bombardments shows the extent of the destruction around them.In 2018, under daily, sometimes hourly, bombardments, Ballour despaired at the hopelessness of their situation as Assad’s forces closed in. She ordered the evacuation of the hospital and the medics who had saved thousands of lives left in fear of their own.The Cave, recorded over two years by Syrian director Feras Fayyad – who also made the Oscar-winning documentary Last Men in Aleppo – captures the full horror of the war: injured adults, children and babies caught in bombing raids arrive covered in blood or choking from a chemical weapons attack surgical operations are carried out without anaesthetic to the sound of classical music. Ballour is also forced to confront local men who, even in extremis, argue that running a hospital is no job for a woman.Today, she hopes she can be a role model for Syrian girls, and has established a fund to challenge gender bias in conflict zones.“I will never forget what I saw. I remember each child and I can see them. I am here to be their voice, to talk about their suffering and their lives. To tell their story of how people are being killed every single day. That is why I am here,” she said"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddd79c03d88148308d9eb89135bd40e0bff1b18c/0_205_3105_1863/master/3105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f81c2f2c4bc118692da2ad3bd55a42b","title":"coronavirus face mask facts spreading covid 19","story":"The truth about how easy it is to catch Covid-19, who is vulnerable and what you can do to avoid infectionWearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill – ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.However, masks will probably make little difference if you’re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply.All viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes Covid-19 is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection – the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most “successful”. This doesn’t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted.The team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more “aggressive”, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage – there haven’t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms.Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.A pandemic is defined as worldwide spread of a new disease – but the exact threshold for declaring one is quite vague. In practice, the actions being taken would not change whether or not a pandemic is declared. Containment measures are not simply about eliminating the disease altogether. Delaying the onset of an outbreak or decreasing the peak is crucial in allowing health systems to cope with a sudden influx of patients."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd127271c9d90bf07f66c4c78fbe8d59027dfddf/0_331_4960_2975/master/4960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61b458dd03d93b61f4e04139268cd794","title":"coronavirus foreign office advice over italy confuses british holidaymakers","story":"FCO updates advice after saying travel to Lombardy largely safe despite mass quarantineThe Foreign Office is facing criticism over its lack of clear advice for British people with holidays booked in northern Italy and those currently in quarantine as a result of the region’s escalating coronavirus crisis.Hours after a decree was approved to lock down the Lombardy region, the department was still advising that it was safe to travel anywhere in Italy except for 11 towns where the outbreak originated.The advice was updated later on Sunday to warn against “all but essential” travel to the whole Lombardy region, including its capital, Milan, as well as areas of Emilia Romagna, Marche, Piedmont and Veneto, including Venice.British holidaymakers had been left confused about whether they could still go to Lombardy and whether those already there could find themselves trapped in the quarantine zone.In the updated advice, the Foreign Office urged travellers to check flight details with airlines and said there were no restrictions on people leaving Italy. At about 8pm, the Department of Health advice about who should self-isolate for 14 days on their return was updated to include all those who had been to the locked-down area, rather than just the original 11 affected towns.Airlines servicing the region follow Foreign Office advice. Late on Sunday night budget airline easyJet announced that it was cancelling some flights to and from areas of Italy affected by the lockdown.A spokesperson said easyJet, “in common with a number of other airlines”, was reviewing its flying programme to Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Venice and Verona until 3 April. The number of flights is expected to continue to decrease until then.The airline said affected passengers would be informed of cancellations by email and text message, and would be offered a full refund or a change of flight. However, flights on other airlines were still being advertised after the updated advice was published. Return flights to Milan on some budget airlines were advertised at less than £40 on some aggregator websites. It means some holidaymakers have been left not knowing whether they can claim compensation from their insurance companies if they want to cancel.Italy’s lockdown plan emerged on Saturday night as the country continues to grapple with the worst coronavirus outbreak in Europe, which has killed 366 people and infected at least 7,375. It was put into effect on Sunday afternoon.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly. Labour and the Lib Dems called on the Foreign Office to clear up confusion and worry among British travellers.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “Since the very start of the coronavirus outbreak, the Foreign Office have been consistently behind the curve in terms of issuing up to date travel and evacuation advice to keep British nationals safe in the highest-risk countries, and we are now in the alarming position where — for unexplained reasons — they appear to be taking a more relaxed attitude than the countries concerned.“Dominic Raab needs to get a grip of this crisis, and pull out all the stops to keep our people safe.”Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, also called on the Foreign Office to give clearer advice to people travelling to or trapped in Italy. He said: “People are increasingly worried about the spread of coronavirus and the government must be providing informed and accurate guidance, especially up-to-date travel advice to all those who could be affected.”Those arriving in the quarantined region in Italy — or planning to travel back — said they had been given no guidance.Crew members of one of the first British Airways flights to depart from Lombardy after the region announced the plans for a lockdown were seen wearing masks onboard, but took them off 15 minutes after take-off.Those onboard included Ben Roeves, who had been able to change his British Airways flight in order to come back to the UK earlier than his scheduled flight later on Sunday after seeing the news about the lockdown of Lombardy.At Milan Linate airport, he said, he had seen more airport staff, security and military than passengers — although the numbers on the security front were no more than normal in comparison with other trips. After landing at London Heathrow, he disembarked at the gate and joined the normal flow of passengers from other flights. British Airways has been approached for comment. Vaughan and Richard Bellamy-Williams, aged 40 and 55, arrived in Milan by train from Paris on Saturday night in the latest leg of their abridged “Phileas Fogg” tour around Europe. They had just checked in at their hotel as information about the Lombardy-wide quarantine emerged on social media.“The trip is now blown, which is a bit of shame,” Vaughan Bellamy-Williams said. “The train was pretty much empty from the French-Italian border. They must have thought we were the only ones mad enough to go to Milan.”The pair were due to travel to the southern Italian town of Bari but have decided to turn back home to London. They have booked a British Airways flight for 8pm on Sunday, which their insurer has said it will cover. Milan remains calm but they feared potential unrest and food shortages, they said.“We both take daily medication and its not a good environment to be enjoying a relaxing holiday,” he said. “We will have to self-quarantine for two weeks but I would rather do that in my own home.”Language teacher Adam Preston, from Scotland, was at a pub with two colleagues in the northern Italian town of Romano di Lombardia on Saturday night when the announcement of the decree appeared on the television.“We saw the word ‘quarantine’ but wondered exactly what that meant in practice. I suppose I hoped the headline was hyperbolic,” the 34-year-old said. “I am still waiting to see what it means — if I can just take my British passport and get on a plane.”Preston said that the announcement does not yet appear to have had much effect in the town of roughly 20,000 people.“Gyms are closed, swimming pools are closed. Supermarkets are kind of bare — people are bulk-buying,” he added.For now he plans to remain in place and decide tomorrow whether he will try to journey home. His school is still open but was closed for a fortnight last month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214b9ea4ab0ce7550b4a608aecbe94873fda0c86/0_36_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=376511f24eedd1ad306724e6b8b453d8","title":"coronavirus should we keep calm and carry on","story":"Simon Jenkins gives a list of “scares” that have not reached the predicted body count (Let them wash your hands, but not your brain, Journal, 7 March). He does not discuss HIVAids and the 1918 flu epidemic, which had devastating consequences. All the medical experts he speaks to are “calm”. Yet the World Health Organization is demanding immediate dramatic action. It cites the actual experience of China moving from 40 cases on 1 January to 3,000 a day in February. Its government was only able to limit this spread by the imposition of a quite astonishing level of social control, including closing all schools and universities, the strict quarantining of whole populations and the use of mass surveillance to track those infected. As the WHO says, this is not a drill and the “carry on as normal” approach is inviting catastrophe.Prof Greg PhiloGlasgow University• Re Simon Jenkins’ article, both awareness and balance are possible.

This message is both simple and life-saving, and it bears infinite repeating.Prof Brendan KellyTrinity College Dublin• Isn’t it time the government dug out some second world war posters? “Coughs and sneezes spread diseases, trap your germs in your handkerchief.” And we could cheer ourselves up with the wartime phrase “for the duration”.

Categories include long-life milk, bleach, dried pasta, tinned vegetables, children’s medications, water and anti-bacterial wipes, gels and sprays.The restrictions apply both online and in stores. Customers have been told by the supermarket: “We know there’s demand for certain products at the moment and we’re working really hard to maintain availability of those to help customers. We’ve taken a common-sense approach to make sure everyone can access essentials.”No other supermarket has yet resorted to rationing food, but the majority are limiting anti-bacterial gels to two per customer — if they have not sold out already.Ocado, the online supermarket, was rationing toilet rolls on Sunday evening, with customers able to buy a maximum of two 12-roll packs of Andrex.Commenting on reports of people panic-buying, Boris Johnson said on Sunday: “We’ve had no advice from the scientific advisers or medical officers that there’s any need for people to buy stuff in.” As of 9am on Sunday, 273 people in the UK had been diagnosed with Covid-19, an increase of 67 from the 206 cases confirmed on Saturday. It represents the largest day-on-day increase in diagnoses. On Sunday evening it was announced a third patient had died in the UK of coronavirus.Coronavirus concerns appear to have created an international rush for toilet paper. Two women have been charged after a fight broke out over toilet roll in an Australian supermarket, a video of which was shared widely online.One Asda customer complained that she had placed an online order for her elderly mother last Sunday, but that it had arrived on Saturday minus the toilet rolls.The environment secretary, George Eustice, will meet with food industry representatives on Monday. A Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: “The environment secretary will hold a further call with chief executives from the UK’s leading supermarkets and industry representatives on 9 March to discuss their response to the coronavirus. The meeting will discuss support for vulnerable groups who may be in isolation.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08f19da0673e187942d9cff8cd89b53864e3c21b/281_868_8438_5062/master/8438.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=685c1a3a6dd496ddf45fc09b1396b8e0","title":"coronavirus symptoms what are they and should i see a doctor","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 6 March, the global death toll was 3,404, while more than 100,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.The death toll has passed 3,000 in China, where there have been over 80,000 cases. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, has had 6,593 cases. More than 55,000 people in China have recovered from Covid-19.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2d816777367dc5d50d949588c9e41994640e1b9/100_0_1720_1032/master/1720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2770b84d71392414e42ef9c140ac6f50","title":"marxist marsupial germanys left draws hope from an unlikely hero","story":"The most popular symbol of the radical left in Germany is an avowed anti-capitalist and a firm believer in collective property. He takes down neo-Nazis with the same bouncy energy as he tackles property speculators.Books expounding his views, running at several volumes, top the German bestseller charts posters bearing his face are currently plastered all over the country’s cities.His only liability, in terms of electoral optics, could be a fatal addiction to booze-filled pralines – and the marsupial pouch in which he keeps his copy of Mao’s red book.The Kangaroo Chronicles, a quartet of comic novels by slam poet Marc-Uwe Kling that has sold millions of copies in Germany over the last 10 years, is a classic man-meets-beast buddy story in the vein of Seth MacFarlane’s 2012 comedy Ted – only that its animal protagonist is mainly vulgar in the Marxist rather than the foul-mouthed sense.A big-budget film based on the cult books opened in German cinemas last week, seemingly showing that hairy lefties stuck in 1970s dogmas don’t just trigger feelings of warm affection in the political bubbles of the big cities, but can also have mainstream appeal.As if to emphasise that message, a day before the movie’s premiere parliamentarians in the eastern state of Thuringia re-elected the only state premier for the leftwing party Die Linke – the popular and widely respected Bodo Ramelow.And throughout the week, several pollsters have predicted that a three-way coalition between the Greens, the Social Democrats and Die Linke could yield a governing majority at the next federal elections, which would be the first time the successor party to the East German Socialist Unity party would enter the national government since the fall of the Berlin Wall.Yet Kling’s cult hit also demonstrates exactly why the kangaroo, an avowed political populist, is also the worst nightmare for a leftwing party with an eye on the seats of power.The film, directed by Swiss filmmaker Dani Levy, shows the communist marsupial team up with Berlin locals against Jörg Dwigs, a Trump-style property tycoon and founder of the fictional AzD (“Alternative to democracy”) party: a classic “the people v the elite” narrative, which the German far left has found more difficult to adopt than its counterparts in Britain, America or Southern Europe.“The German left is still nervous about using populist rhetoric,” said Jürgen Lang, a political scientist and journalist who specialises in the history of Die Linke. “There’s a fear that once you go down the road of talking about ‘the people’, you are in an arena where the far right will beat you at that game.”Even in a left party notoriously ided between libertarian, orthodox anti-capitalist and Trotskyist wings, said Lang, “there are factions that hold populist positions, but there isn’t really a populist faction”.Aufstehen! (Get Up!), an attempt to manufacture a left wing populist grassroots movement along the lines of France’s gilets jeunes led by charismatic Die Linke politician Sahra Wagenknecht, disintegrated barely a year into its existence.Bodo Ramelow hails from Die Linke’s party branches in the east. Unlike the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which is at its most rabidly nationalistic in the states that used to make up the German Democratic Republic, left party politicians in the same regions have shown themselves more interested in forming governing alliances than theorising about world revolution.“Ramelow and his people have, in the past few years, shown us evidence that they are capable of accident-free, pragmatic and solid governance,” wrote Der Spiegel this week.For there to be a realistic possibility of a Green-Red-Red coalition after the next German elections, scheduled for 2021, the Left party will have to prove that it is capable of containing its Kangaroo-ish tendencies, however.A video that surfaced in Germany media last week briefly seemed to threaten Ramelow’s chances of being re-elected.Rather than criticising the comments, the party’s co-leader Bernd Riexinger responded with an attempt at a joke: “We are not shooting them, but we will make them do some useful work.” Ramelow was one of the first to criticise the comments when the video emerged, calling them “unacceptable”.Anyone who sees The Kangaroo Chronicles will know that a broad-church German left setting its eyes on government in 2021 will meet similar turbulence along the way. “We can be friends,” the movie’s marsupial hero says to his more moderate political ally, before whispering to himself: “Until after the revolution, anyway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef4819bfbea24aeb79d32d4fbb18201e5d8060b8/0_258_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c67963bbab02970326a4ffd688e3e6bc","title":"saudi arabia releases images king salman amid purge royals","story":"Monarch seen carrying out duties as speculation mounts over crown prince’s successionSaudi monarch King Salman was pictured carrying out official duties on Sunday, two days after his brother and the former heir to his throne were arrested in a sweep that sparked a new wave of palace intrigue and speculation about his health.Photographs released by the Saudi royal court showed the 84-year-old king receiving several ambassadors and reading through correspondence. The images doused claims that the detention on Friday of Prince Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who was ousted as Crown Prince two years ago, heralded an imminent change of ruler.The move came as two other princes who had also been arrested were freed late on Sunday. A source confirmed that both Prince Abdul Aziz bin Saud bin Nayef and Prince Saud bin Nayef had been questioned by royal court aides since being seized from their homes on Friday.Saudi officials continued to insist on Sunday that the detentions had foiled the early stages of a coup against the heir to the throne, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who had ordered his relatives arrested. He is viewed as the de facto ruler, controlling all the major arms of government from defence to the economy.Officials said King Salman himself had signed the arrest warrants, an unusual move against two of the Kingdom’s most senior royals — one of whom, Prince Ahmed, is his only surviving full brother.Both men had been seen as among the last remaining obstacles to Prince Mohammed’s almost inevitable ascension. Earlier purges of business figures and rivals had already cleared the way for the 34-year-old crown prince.The early-morning arrests caused new shockwaves in a kingdom shaken by three years of cultural reforms combined with a ruthless crackdown on dissent, highlighted by the 2018 murder of the critic and journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which was carried out by royal court aides.King Salman’s support for his son appearedconsistent throughout. However, persistent reports from inside the palace revealed glimpses of an ongoing tussle for power, which the young crown prince appeared to be winning.Saudi observers and regional officials were still scrambling to make sense of the latest arrests, which came hours after the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, was received by the king. A source told the  that both detained princes had called their families on Saturday telling them they were being kept in private villas.Prince Ahmed asked for a robe that hetraditionally wore for public appearances, the source said. The request caused speculation that he might soon make a statement. Other senior princes were reportedly ordered to make public assertions of support for Prince Mohammed in the immediate aftermath of the arrests, three of whom did so on Twitter. Prince Mohammed, in his role as crown prince, has accumulated unparalleled power for an heir and effectively rules Saudi Arabia. He has claimed to be in no hurry to take his father’s chair, but his critics – including some from the ranks of the senior royals and ruling families in the Gulf – have claimed that he is impatient and impertinent, seeing him as unpredictable and brash. “The Kuwaiti leader has never warmed to him, the Emiratis are often dismayed and have erged over Yemen, and the Qataris think they have his measure,” said one senior western official. “There are a few around the neighbourhood who are bent on making sure this isn’t a smooth run to the throne.”Dissidents outside the Kingdom had claimed the arrests of Prince Ahmed and Mohammed bin Nayef would lead to King Salman being sidelined in coming days or weeks.However, it is understood that he wants to remain in power until at least the G20 summit in Riyadh in November, which is seen as a crowning achievement for a kingdom trying to break the shackles of decades of hardline rule underpinned by deep cultural repression.“It was all very confusing over the weekend, and the course of travel still isn’t clear,” the source said. “But I wouldn’t put money on the king being forced out. That would be a very difficult sell even for MbS (Prince Mohammed). It would play poorly with the region and would be a hard sell to his allies.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4196753.1583687394!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish universities face financial black hole over coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFees for non-EU undergraduate students range between €10,000-€20,000 in engineering and science, while they climb to between €40,000-€55,000 for those studying medicine.Irish universities face losing tens of millions of euro in tuition fees from the impact of coronavirus due to large numbers of international students from China and elsewhere being forced to cancel or postpone enrolments.Sources across several universities say contingency plans being drawn up include delaying international student entry or providing online courses for these students until the virus threat subsides.Irish universities have become increasingly reliant on revenue from international tuition fees due to a reduction in State investment per student over the past decade or so.The bulk of most university income is now generated privately and international fees account for a large proportion of this.For example, fees for non-EU undergraduate students range between €10,000-€20,000 for students studying business, engineering and science, while they climb to between €40,000-€55,000 for those studying medicine.Post-graduate non-EU students typically pay between €10,000 and €35,000.“There are significant concerns in the system right now,” said one senior higher-education source. It has the potential to get significantly worse. The longer this goes on, the more serious the implications are.”Another said international student recruitment was already suffering, which would place universities under acute pressure in the coming academic year.“This wasn’t so much an issue in the past when most funding came from the State, but we don’t have that luxury anymore,” said another source.One source said options such as delaying the academic year for international students were being considered. Another involves allowing students to begin their course online for a discounted fee.Another source said it is planning to switch its international student recruitment to markets where the impact of coronavirus has been less severe.Latest figure indicate there are an estimated 32,000 international students attending Irish universities whose tuition fees generate in excess of €200 million annually.In a report prepared for the Irish Universities Association last year, Indecon estimated that international students also generated an additional €120 million in non-tution fee expenditure.Bookings downMany universities and colleges are also worried at a potential drop off in summer students learning English. These people typically occupy on-campus accommodation between June and August.Some sources say many from Italy and Spain are holding off making bookings, or cancelling existing bookings.Many English language schools are also worried about the prospect of a fall-off in international student numbers.It is estimated that more than 120,000 international English-language students attend language schools here, placing Ireland fifth place globally in terms of actual numbers of students per head of population.Trinity College Dublin, meanwhile, has told staff and students that a member of the college community who was diagnosed with coronavirus appears to have made a good recovery. In a message sent on Sunday afternoon, it said: “At this time, no other case has been diagnosed to our knowledge. Most of the Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute is functioning as normal except for a few rooms on the fourth floor. “The college remains open for the moment and most students should attend classes and other activities as normal on Monday.” In a series of protective measures, it has instructed any students or staff returning from “high-risk” areas to avoid coming into college for 14 days . Travel to affected areas has also been banned.It also appealed to the college community not to “engage with or contribute to the circulation of rumours on social media as this is unhelpful and causes unnecessary anxiety”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Two new cases of the coronavirus Covid-19 have been confirmed by the HSE, bringing to 21 the number of confirmed cases in the Republic to date.It said both cases were as a result of transmission of the virus in the community.The National Public Health Emergency Team said one of the cases involved a female in the east of the country. The other involved a male in the south of the country and was associated with the Bon Secours Hospital in Cork.It said a risk assessment was underway, adding the HSE was “now working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients may have had, to provide them with information and advice to prevent further spread”.Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer with the Department of Health, said on Sunday: “Ireland remains in containment phase with 21 cases to date, three of which are associated with community transmission.“Most people who become infected with Covid-19 experience a mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for some.“Every inidual needs to be aware of how to protect their own health and the health of others.“The most important way they can do this is by following public health advice.”This includes washing hands regularly with soap and water maintaining at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughingsneezing avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth and practice cough and sneeze hygiene.The 19th confirmed case was announced on Saturday. It was a man from the east of Ireland who had travelled from Italy.Earlier, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said it could not dispute reported projections that up to 1.9 million people could become sick as a result of contracting the coronavirus.However, Mr Reid said modelling work on how the Covid-19 outbreak could impact the country would not be completed until later in the week.The Business Post reported on Sunday that health authorities were forecasting that about 40 per cent of the population could become sick as a result of the virus. Mr Reid said he could not dispute these figures, but said the work was not yet concluded and the evidence was changing day by day.Much of northern Italy has been put in a state of quarantine as a result of the outbreak there. The measures, which are due to be in place for a month, are expected to affect some 16 million people. There have been seven confirmed cases in Northern Ireland to date.Mr Reid said the health service had plans to deal with a surge in the numbers who become most seriously ill as a result of the coronavirus. These include using high dependency units, resuscitation units and intensive care facilities in the private sector.He told RTÉ’s This Week programme that the Government had also allocated an additional €20million to open a further 25 intensive care beds in the public hospital system.Sudden impactMr Reid said the HSE was looking to take actions that would prevent the coronavirus having a sudden impact on the health service and rather to spread the effects over a longer period of time. He also said close to 100 health staff in Cork had been impacted as a result of a case of coronavirus identified in a patient last week at Cork University Hospital (CUH).Authorities have been unable to establish how he fell ill with the virus. When the case was first confirmed, 60 staff were told to self-isolate. Mr Reid said the health system could not sustain that level of staff having to self-isolate.CUH on Sunday said it would be reducing and rescheduling outpatient appointments between Monday and Wednesday as a result of the coronavirus.It said services including dialysis, radiation therapy, infusions, endoscopy, chemotherapy, cystic fibrosis treatments and the dressings clinic would not be impacted by the rescheduling of appointments. Surgeries are to proceed as normal unless patients are contacted and advised otherwise.“All other appointments are being rescheduled, unless patients are directly contacted by the hospital to attend their scheduled appointment,” the hospital said in a statement, which added that visiting restrictions remain in place throughout the facility.“Cork University Hospital apologises for any inconvenience this may cause to patients.”Under new rules announced on Saturday healthcare workers who have had close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19 but have not developed symptoms, and are deemed to be essential workers, may work, provided they adhere to infection control precautions. They will also have to undergo twice daily monitoring for 14 days.SymptomsHealth workers who have had close contact with a confirmed coronavirus case and have developed symptoms are to be excluded from work.Mr Reid said the health service would take every action possible to protect the public. He said he had received full support from the Government and there would be “no short steps”.It was announced on Saturday that recruitment restrictions in place in the health service are to be lifted to deal with the outbreak. Siptu said on Sunday that this would not only apply to nurses but also other essential grades in the health service.The HSE said there would be “no barriers to the recruitment of the workforce that is required to support our critical clinical services during the Covid -19”.“The HSE are also expediting all other avenues in terms of those on panels and awaiting appointment, those who have left the service for reasons of retirement, career break, secondments etc are also being identified and contacted,” a spokeswoman said.“The HSE will ensure that every method of engaging staff that are required for managing services at this time are maximised and we will not fall short in this regard.”In proposals tabled to trade unions on Friday, the HSE said that if a national public health emergency was declared in relation to Covid -19, the cancellation of annual and discretionary leave would, if necessary, be considered by the National Crisis Management Team. It said that some or all identified non-essential services may have to be cancelled or postponed in order to deal with the effects of the covid-19 infection.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Three new cases of Covid-19 in NI but health staff working to prevent spread of the virusHSE has said staff may be required to work different hours or in a different location in its policy to deal with coronavirusJournalist organised rally demanding equal status for men and women in Catholic ChurchFigure is almost as many removals as had taken place in the previous two yearsHSE chief \u0026lsquocannot dispute\u0026rsquo forecast of 1.9m people falling ill but evidence was changing dailyColleges fear losing millions as foreign students may be obliged to cancel enrolmentAviation authorities signal radar record after RAF fighters confront long-range bombersAdvice, covering Milan and Venice, comes after strict measures announced in response to outbreakBoth teams taking precautions as number of cases in NI rises to sevenRory\u0026rsquos was the only shop in what has become Dublin\u0026rsquos party district when it opened in 1960Raiders were armed with hammer during incident in Leopardstown complexGarda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau involved in operation near ShankillChoosing the right course and institution is the first stepRelatives say the centenary of the mutiny is a good time for a gesture of reconciliationGarda\u0026iacute are appealing for witnessesAbsense of ill leader Naomi Long a shame for party acting like it has the wind in its sailsWhat is the Graduate Management Admission Test for?HSE says there will be \u0026lsquono barriers\u0026rsquo to health recruitment in response to outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4196598.1583674451!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus footballer diagnosed after match in northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA nurse during a demonstration of the Coronavirus pod and COVID-19 virus testing procedures set-up beside  Antrim Area Hospital, Co Antrim in Northern Ireland.

In a statement they said that, immediately after the confirmation, the club contacted all Hanover FC players as well as Coagh United and those involved in the Mid Ulster Football League. “(We are) liaising with the NHS via their helpline for advice which has now been passed on to all in question,” the statement added. “We also immediately cancelled a planned function and have arranged for a deep clean to be performed by qualified contractors. “Again we wish to stress that this was something we had no prior knowledge (of) but, following swift actions upon discovery, we hope that this will help ensuring all those in direct contact with the person in questions remains unaffected.” Upper Bann DUP MP Carla Lockhart said: “My thoughts are with the player who has contracted this virus and I wish him a speedy recovery and return to full health again. “Hanover FC are to be commended for their swift actions and openness on this sensitive matter.”The North’s Public Health Agency said “staff are working quickly to identify contacts the iniduals may have had, with the objective of preventing further spread of the virus”.“Further positive tests have been expected and the advice to the public remains unchanged. Northern Ireland is still in the containment phase,” added the department. The department said that in line “with established protocols, presumptive positive Northern Ireland test results are sent to Public Health England laboratories for verification”. – Additional reporting from PAStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4196738.1583686329!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus irish residents advised against non essential travel to northern italy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers disembark a train that arrived in Naples from Milan on Sunday.

Photograph: Cesare AbbateEPA.The Department of Foreign Affairs has warned Irish people against non-essential travel to parts of northern Italy, including Milan and Venice, after emergency measures to deal with the coronavirus outbreak were announced. The department’s updated travel advice covers areas of Italy, where an estimated 16 million people live, that have been put in effective quarantine following a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases. The emergency measures say people should not enter or leave Lombardy, Italy’s richest region, and 14 provinces in four other regions, which include cities such as Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia and Rimini. The move came in response to the number of confirmed coronavirus cases increasing by more than 1,200 in a 24-hour period this weekend - the largest increase since the country’s outbreak began two weeks ago. Deaths attributed to the virus increased to 233 and the number of patients in intensive care as a result of the outbreak has risen to 567 (up 23 per cent).UnprecedentedThe unprecedented restrictions are to remain in force until April 3rd after being signed into law by prime minister Giuseppe Conte on Saturday night.Mr Conte said nobody would be allowed to move in or out of the areas covered by the restrictions, or within them, unless they had proven, work-related reasons for doing so, or health issues.“We are facing a national emergency ... we have to limit the spread of the virus and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed,” he said. In its updated travel advice, the department said that until “further notice, we are advising that citizens do not travel to the region of Lombardy, and to the other provinces that have been placed in isolation”. “For the moment, we are advising against non-essential travel to the regions of Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Piedmont, and Le Marche.” It said tourist attractions, ski resorts, museums, bars and nightclubs would be closed in these areas until April 3rd. “Restaurants and cafés will have limited opening hours and movements within and around isolated areas will be subject to police checks,” the department said. “The elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions, have been advised by the Italian government to remain indoors.” InsuranceWhen an official advisory against travel is in place, those who have booked holidays to the area and have travel insurance could be able to claim for losses incurred. People who have booked with tour operators should also be able to obtain refunds or reschedule their trips.The impact that the Italian measures will have in the short-term was unclear on Sunday evening and the main airports in the affected regions appeared to be operating normally, with three flights scheduled to and from Dublin and Milan on Sunday. Neither Ryanair or Aer Lingus responded to queries as to what impact the quarantining of northern Italy would have on their flights to the region. Nor did the airlines say how many people departing from northern Italy travelled to Dublin this weekend, which was when three Six Nations matches between Irish and Italian teams were due to take place before being cancelled as a result of the virus. Many Italian fans still travelled to Dublin having made their bookings with more than 10 flights from northern Italy arriving on Friday and Saturday.

She said the Russian aircraft were prevented from entering British airspace north of Ireland.After a similar incident when Typhoons scrambled twice in one day last August – before the UK left the European Union – in response to Russian Bear bombers approaching British airspace, the MoD said Russian aircraft “frequently attempt to test Nato’s level of readiness” as well as conduct “intelligence-gathering missions”.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Islamists pelt campaigners with stones on march through Pakistan\u0026rsquos capital IslamabadAuthorities say 71 people inside hotel at time of collapse, 58 were under quarantineGunmen open fire at Kabul ceremony attended by political leader Abdullah AbdullahBlossom-viewing parties, concerts, sporting events and job fairs all falling victim to coronavirusIn China, schools in provinces reporting no new cases started to set opening datesChina sees rise in new confirmed cases as Australia imposes further border controlsFear, bewilderment among those told to isolate themselves but do not know whyExplainer: Fragile breakthrough aimed at withdrawal of US troops faces many obstaclesCountry\u0026rsquos first weapons test in three months after lockdown to halt spread of coronavirusChengdu Letter: Despite handling of the crisis, Xi Jinping\u0026rsquos government still has support42 dead and neighbourhoods trashed after clashes between Muslim and Hindu communitiesPanic-buying began after death of nation\u0026rsquos first coronavirus victim on February 13thGermany says it is heading for epidemic as France has second death and Greece has first caseUneasy calm follows sectarian violence over citizenship law that critics say is biased against MuslimsClashes erupt between two sides over controversial citizenship law as Trump visitsSweden demands release of Gui Minhai, sentenced on charges of leaking intelligenceDecision by 94-year-old leader threatens future of southeast Asian country\u0026rsquos ruling coalitionItaly battling with explosion of cases, which rose on Saturday to over 150Members of the Irish community in Wuhan react to news that they will not be allowed to leave compounds until March 10thThe simians have lost all fear of humans \u0026ndash irrespective of their importance or statureStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4196914.1583702436!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taliban declines to mark women s day in afghanistan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWomen participate in Aurat March, Urdu for Women’s March, in Islamabad, Pakistan.

Never one to miss a good bandwagon, here’s my suggestion. Coronavirus, though deeply alarming, offers an opportunity to turn back the clock on some of the most egregious cultural howlers to hit these shores.Some claim that the “stiff upper lip” was only ever a temporary aberration. In Weeping Britannia, a cultural history of crying, the historian Thomas Dixon describes this national characteristic as a “myth”, drawn from a brief period between the end of the Victorian sentimental era and the funeral of Winston Churchill in 1965, when thousands lined the route with dry-eyed restraint. Three decades later, Princess Diana’s death engulfed Britain in a tidal-wave of lachrymosity, which has never fully subsided. Much as I admire Dixon’s thesis, I say this is quitter’s talk.Already, the reaction of state and civil society suggests that rumours of the death of British stoicism may be exaggerated. The government has so far struck the right balance between panic and complacency. We have a new media sensation in the form of chief medical officer Chris Whitty. An unlikely hero in these fickle, celebrity-obsessed times, to be sure, but so eminently reasonable, so reassuringly bureaucratic, that his mere presence has a soothing effect.Most impressive of all has been the public. Some frenzied hoarding aside, habits have changed quickly, calmly and with little fanfare. The sight of a group of hand-washers, dutifully humming Happy Birthday or God Save the Queen now fills me with pride. Introverts have particularly taken to the new regime, relishing the opportunity to spurn social engagements and crowded events.Older folk accept their heightened risks with dour nonchalance “We’ve all got to die of something”, as my 79-year-old Dad put it recently. Many view the explosion of dark humour as offensive. To me it is both empowering - showing that we’re not defeated yet - and a welcome return to Anglo-Saxon bloody mindedness.British reserve could make a reappearance, too, following decades of touchy-feely mission creep. Pleasingly, the enforced chumminess of the sign of peace at church has been downgraded to nodding rather than effusive handshaking.The middle-classes have long felt pressure to engage in the mwah-mwah double-cheek peck, perhaps to evoke a sense of continental flair. But for safety’s sake, we should revert to the restraint preached by Basil and Sybil Fawlty (“What are you doing?” “I’m kissing you, dear” “Well don’t”). Perhaps we could even start wearing broad-brimmed hats again, the perfect accessory to keep would-be kissers at bay and make the remote nod a necessity.In a new era of pandemics, standoffishness has much to recommend it.Pandemics and epidemicsThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The pieces had been chosen by the folk musician Nancy Kerr as part of her selection for Radio 3’s Inside Music – a two-hour weekly slot in which musicians present their eclectic personal choice of compositions.Beside the Bach, Kerr’s choices included some works that I love, some that I don’t, and a remarkable pairing of the familiar and strange – Béla Bartók’s Romanian Folk Dances in their original version, and vividly reimagined by the Romanian ensemble, Taraf de Haidouks. By the end of my trip, I had been cheered by some old favourites, inspired by new works, and encouraged to consider why I am moved by Schiff’s performance of Bach, while Dame Ethel Smyth’s rousing anthem, The March of the Women, leaves me cold.Beyond some years of schoolgirl piano lessons, I have no particular musical knowledge. I am an amateur, in the strict sense of the word – interested in music of all genres, not just classical – and I bring to my listening what you might describe as an intelligent lack of expertise. There, it strikes me, my duties as an auditor end but Sir András has other ideas.In a forthcoming memoir, Music Comes Out of Silence, based on conversations with the journalist Martin Meyer, Schiff bemoans the declining “quality and general culture” of modern audiences. “The average listener of today has hardly the faintest idea about what he is hearing. He neither knows anything about new music, nor can he differentiate between outstanding, moderately good and poor performances.” He suggests that while concert-goers of the past developed their taste by learning to play an instrument and read a score, the decline of music education has meant that the virtuosity (or otherwise) of contemporary musicians falls upon ignorant ears.There is an old-school testiness about these reflections which tends to confirm the idea that – with rare exceptions – musicians are most expressive in their chosen medium. Once they turn to language, they are as prone as the rest of us to clumsiness and disharmony. But there is also a sense that Schiff, after years on the concert platform, has forgotten the innocent pleasure of being an amateur.When I went to hear Sir András play the Goldberg Variations some years ago, I could have followed the score, beadily noting the precision with which he observed dynamic markings and ornamentation. Instead I chose simply to listen, trusting him to interpret Bach’s work, and trusting myself to appreciate his interpretation (or not, as the case may be).The essence of performance in any genre is communication. Professionals, who have built their reputation on relentless hard work, understandably conflate excellence with expertise but audiences have an acute sense of something beyond mere technical brilliance: you could call it authenticity.No doubt our attachment to this elusive quality leads us sometimes into errors of taste: admiration for performers (various names spring instantly to mind) who might not conform to Sir András’s fastidious criteria. But it is surely a kind of professional deformation to think that only the well informed can appreciate great works of art.If we want classical music to survive, we need to invite everyone into the concert hall, not check their credentials at the door.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

And it\u0027s exciting to see Bond try to be his normal self among women of a 2020 mindset.The reaction to him is what\u0027s important. You see how women like Nomi have to deal with men like him in the workplace.The actor added that her character could be seen as more senior than Bond in the new film as her methods are more up-to-date.She said: Bond\u0027s been gone a long time and now here comes this new agent who is hungry. Yes, you could say she thinks she is more capable of getting the job done in 2020, since her methods are up to date.Last year, there were rumours that Nomi would be the new 007, taking the title from her older colleague.When asked if she saw the rumours, she said: I did, I\u0027m really glad that conversation\u0027s happening. Because black women have very rarely in cinema been given the opportunity to be in power, where they\u0027re able to be the example.Daniel Craig this weekend insisted that the delayed No Time To Die will be his final Bond film, meaning a replacement will have to be found soon.Craig had been set to appear in his fifth Bond movie next month, but its release was pushed back to November due to the global spread of coronavirus.While it had been widely believed a new actor would take over following No Time To Die, recent reports suggested Craig was contemplating staying on.However, he used his hosting gig on Saturday Night Live to confirm it would be his final 007 film.This next James Bond film is going to be my last, Craig said. But it\u0027s going to be one of the best. Because we got Phoebe Waller-Bridge from Fleabag come to help with some of the dialogue.In a nod to Fleabag\u0027s irreverent breaking of the fourth wall, Craig added: It\u0027s not going to be that different.

I had already been involved in previous outbreaks like Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever (during the Sierra Leone civil war in 1997) and was focused on how to improve treatment but at the same time stop the spread of infection in health care.Health professionals are on the frontline of such outbreaks. Over the years many colleagues have ended up contracting diseases, often with tragic consequences.  SARS - like Ebola - was spread through healthcare facilities. I’m really worried about the potential of Covid-19 to do the same.During severe outbreaks staff are forced to work in extreme circumstances and can miss out on essential steps of protection. I remember a nurse I once saw crying into her gloved hands on an Ebola ward, grieving for a friend she had cared for during her last hours of life or a doctor who performed a difficult procedure on a nurse with Lassa fever in a dimly-lit, overcrowded ward with no bin to store his medical waste.  In order to combat these outbreaks we also need to follow the standards of infection control that are supposed to apply to every single patient in health care - I think this will be the biggest threat to the UK during this outbreak.   These include the so-called ‘standard precautions’ that include avoiding contact with patients’ body fluids, preventing the spread of fluids or droplets and adhering to strict standards of cleanliness of equipment and rooms. Such measures may sound simple and are universally agreed, but regularly ignored by busy staff (including in the UK).   As a result of SARS proper infection control measures kicked in more effectively in those countries who lost staff. The likes of Hong-Kong, Singapore and Canada, were described as having been “burned by SARS” and adopted new standards in response. The challenge now is for the UK to implement such standards quickly across every branch of healthcare. Otherwise who knows what might be the eventual impact of Covid-19?During the H1N1 outbreak I was a researcher focusing on pandemic preparedness. I had been contacted by the House of Lords to contribute to an inquiry about preparedness in the wake of avian flu and was working as a specialist advisor to the Cabinet Office. Then, in the middle of the inquiry, H1N1 happened.The first cases were in April 2009 in Mexico. It seemed severe at the beginning with potentially high numbers of fatalities but very quickly it became quite evident the disease was not as severe as initially feared.The virus circulated very quickly in the UK but proved to be quite mild so containment wasn’t really necessary. Also everybody knew a vaccine would come along quite quickly and in the meantime we had anti-virals to limit the impact.With coronavirus we don’t have that weaponry. Another concern is that H1N1 started in April at the end of the influenza season which really helped the response. It is not yet proven whether warmer temperatures will affect the spread of coronavirus – there is a lot we still don’t know.Ultimately H1N1 led to nearly 460 deaths in Britain but seemed to particularly affect children and pregnant women. The number of people hospitalised was actually very small but even then it put hospitals under pressure. At one point every paediatric critical care bed was in use.With coronavirus, the affected population is different with a very high fatality rate among over 80s and a need for intensive care spaces. There is a risk of the virus being spread around hospitals and care homes are another worry. The H1N1 outbreak emphasised to us the need to be flexible in our response – and certainly coronavirus will test that once more.In 2014, I was working in the main teaching hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone, leading a small team from King’s College London working to strengthen the health system. Ebola had started over the border in Guinea and my first memories are knowing the outbreak was heading towards us and thinking how are we going to get prepared? In the early months of the outbreak, almost all of the staff who were infected with Ebola at our hospital died. One face that stays in my mind was an amazing young nurse called Hajara Serry, who we were supporting to improve emergency care. One day I saw her slumped in her chair with a yellow glaze to her eyes that we had come to recognise as ‘Ebola eyes’.I remember putting her in the ambulance late on Saturday. We both knew she was almost certainly going to die, and that my farewell would probably be the last words she would ever hear – she didn’t survive the journey. I’m still haunted by the knowledge that we had failed to protect her.In the early days of the outbreak, officials thought the best thing to do was to downplay things. It’s hard to imagine the unimaginable and there is this innate desire not to worry people. That’s fine for a few weeks but then when the virus comes you haven’t laid the groundwork. I worked with England’s current Chief Medical Officer Chris Witty during the outbreak and the approach he is taking with coronavirus, of being honest and urging people to get prepared, is definitely the way to go. But, as with Ebola, it is now already too late to get fully prepared. The first line of defence in any outbreak is a strong healthcare system and the NHS has been underfunded for too long, pushing it to breaking point. This idea that any country can suddenly find more doctors or wards overnight is fanciful – those things take time and investment to build.We’re going to have to deal with the fact that there are a lot of unknowns with coronavirus. The public needs to be informed – there can’t be a disconnect between communities and the public health experts. We need to get organised and become part of the response, caring for our neighbours and taking care not to spread misinformation or fake news. All of us need to step up. I was chairman of Public Health England (PHE) in 2012 when a man who had recently arrived in London from the Middle East was taken to hospital with a severe respiratory infection.  PHE did genetic sequencing on the virus and matched it to a similar infection and genetic sequence that had been reported to a public discussion forum a few weeks previously by an Egyptian doctor working in Saudi Arabia.It proved to be Britain’s first case of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - a respiratory illness caused by the MERS coronavirus that is believed to infect camels which then spread it to humans. The patient was isolated immediately in St Thomas’ Hospital and no further transmission occurred.  Since 2012 there have been five cases of MERS confirmed in England and they have caused no outbreaks. During this same period nearly 1,500 people suspected to have the infection were tested in UK laboratories.This PHE experience of it shows the importance of strong infection control in hospitals, while other countries such as South Korea have suffered large MERS outbreaks when sub-standard infection control practices occurred in health facilities.With all emerging infections there are many concerns, but two which particularly stand out are that health workers are at great risk of infection and that all humans are susceptible because they have not experienced previous infection that develops antibody protection. Last week, the first case of a patient being infected with Covid-19 within the UK was discovered in Haslemere, the small commuter town just off the A3. It was, to me especially, an eerie twist of fate: two years ago, Haslemere was at the heart of another pandemic, this time a fictional one I and a team of experts created as part of an experimental documentary. The idea was simple. Using a newly-built app, we would ‘infect’ the good people of Haslemere, then track where they went and who they interacted with over the course of a day, allowing us to view how quickly a potentially deadly virus spreads. At the time I remember saying it would be a case of “when, not if” Britain is hit by a deadly pandemic. Whether Covid-19 is that pandemic remains to be seen, but our findings in 2018 were certainly telling. We saw there are certain places where transmission is more likely to occur, like train stations, medical centres and high streets. Our  ‘super-spreader’, in fact, was a worker in a hardware shop. Those findings weren’t entirely surprising, but the model also showed how simply the contagion could be slowed, especially by hand-washing. It is the main piece of advice being issued at the moment for a reasonThe data told us so: our simulation predicted that the number of people who caught our ‘virus’ within 100 days could be slashed from 42 million to 21 million – but only if people washed their hands an extra five to 10 times a day. Ours was ‘just’ a data model, of course, but those findings are now being used to help organisations tasked with dealing with Covid-19. We knew it would be useful I didn’t quite think it would be so soon.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/05/19/container.jpg","title":"coronavirus business impact britain no deal brexit","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.While large multinationals may be able to ride out the economic turmoil on the horizon, some smaller firms have more to worry about.\u0026nbspBen Chapman reportsBritish manufacturers say they are summoning up the “wartime spirit” to deal with anticipated staff shortages and supply disruption caused by the coronavirus.But for some, the major concern is a short, deep shock from the outbreak followed by the longer, more drawn-out pain of a hard Brexit.While large multinationals may be able to ride out those twin problems, some smaller firms have more to worry about.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe government warned this week that up to a fifth of the workforce could be off sick at the height of the Covid-19 epidemic, a scenario that would present serious problems for manufacturers.“We may have a few people off or we may be decimated,” says Donald Pow, a manager at Allied Vehicles Group in Glasgow.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson spokesman insists coronavirus will not delay BrexitAround 250 of Allied’s 670 staff work in manufacturing, mostly in Glasgow. They operate 15 stages of a production line which transforms ordinary vehicles to make them accessible for people with disabilitiesWorkers at each stage have specialised expertise which can’t necessarily be replaced if significant numbers are off work. Clearly working from home is not an option.“It’s very difficult. We can move people from other parts of the business but at some point we would not be running efficiently,” says Pow. “We’re not just going to shut our doors and say, ‘Things are a bit difficult, let’s stop working.’\u0026nbspThere’s a bit of that wartime spirit.”For Allied, Brexit, and the\u0026nbspuncertainty over what it will entail, represent bigger concerns than the virus, says Pow –\u0026nbspat least for now.The company exports vehicles to countries across western Europe. It is already concerned about tariffs and the effect of a highly uncertain future. “Brexit is affecting both the reality of our business and our customers’ confidence,” says Pow, who is concerned the company will be less competitive in future with rivals based inside the EU.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The same cannot be said for many British companies who may need to call on emergency funding to ride any turbulence caused by the outbreak.The Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey\u0026nbsp(who starts the job in 10\u0026nbspdays), told MPs this week he may take action imminently to support lending to struggling small businesses. That might include relaxing banks’ capital requirements to allow them to hand out more loans – but there’s no guarantee that the banks will actually do it.Live: EU reveals ‘very difficult differences’ with UK over BrexitBoris Johnson spokesman insists coronavirus will not delay BrexitCoronavirus and no-deal Brexit: Spot the differenceBoost from US trade deal could be as small as 0.02 per cent of GDPFor some British firms, the impact is already being felt.Tudor Rose International, a Gloucestershire-based logistics company, exports well-known food and drinks brands around the world.\u0026nbspIt is close to the sharp end of the outbreak. Costs have shot up around 15 per cent so far as the company struggles to find enough ships to transport its products, says commercial manager\u0026nbspJohn Stephenson.\u0026nbspTudor Rose is losing sales as ships stay stuck in Chinese ports, causing a major backlog in the key arteries of world trade.\u0026nbspWith many Chinese factories shut down to contain the virus’s spread, there is much less to ship and so freight companies have cancelled sailings. That leaves British firms facing a shortage of containers to put their goods into, pushing up prices.“It has an effect all along those routes via places like Mumbai and the Middle East,” says\u0026nbspStephenson.Shipping is often seen as a canary in the coal mine for economic shocks to come. With a vessel taking about a month to make its way from China to Europe, the sharp drop in activity in China is still working its way through.Stephenson estimates that there are about 100 fewer vessels on the global routes along which Tudor Rose ships its food and drink. That may not sound like a lot but each one is vast, carrying an average 20,000 containers.Two million fewer containers has a real impact, says Stephenson. “It’s already been quite pronounced. We’ve had a customer already waiting for a large order that we haven’t been able to fill.”Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe effect coronavirus is having on shipping is unprecedented, he says. “We do see some seasonality of demand but we’ve not seen an event like this that’s had this much impact.”Tudor Rose has been looking to boost sales in North America where disruption has been less severe than Asia but there is a limit to this strategy.“We sell fast-moving consumer goods so we need a consistent, regular supply to our customers,” says Stephenson. The company anticipates some rebound in demand when the outbreak calms down but for the most part, sales lost now are likely to be lost for good.If Chinese ports open up fully again things will improve, but Tudor Rose fears there may be further shutdowns at other key points along the route as governments seek to contain the virus.“We are at the early stages of this. It’s only in the last 10\u0026nbspdays that it’s come to light how significant this could be,”\u0026nbspsays StephensonBack in Glasgow, Donald Pow is remaining vigilant but relatively relaxed, given the situation. “We don’t know what’s going to happen many of the experts don’t seem to know what’s going to happen.”“It’s like that old football manager cliche: we just take each game as it comes.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Or are companies in for disappointment?Hundreds of flights have been cancelled, major sporting events called off.Business has dried up entirely for some unfortunate firms.The economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak has already been significant.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd it’s likely to get worse.There’s speculation the Tokyo Olympics this summer might need to be postponed – a festival on which the Japanese government has already spent some $25bn (£19bn).But that’s why businesses and iniduals take out insurance isn’t it? To cover themselves for when unexpected and hugely damaging shocks like disease outbreaks hit?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Latest travel updates as coronavirus continues to spreadCan face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe UK government this week, under pressure from industry lobby groups, designated\u0026nbspCovid-19 a “notifiable disease”, in order to make it easier for affected companies to claim insurance.So can we expect an avalanche of claims and big losses for insurance companies as a result of this outbreak?Or are companies in for disappointment if they expect to be compensated for the economic damage wreaked by Covid-19?It’s worth drawing a distinction between two broad categories of business insurance, say experts.First, there’s event cancellation insurance, which is a type generally offered by sophisticated insurance markets like Lloyd’s of London or major insurance conglomerates.Torsten Jeworrek of the German insurer Munich Re\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspReuters\u0026nbsplast month that his firm had provided cancellation insurance for the Tokyo games “in the hundreds of millions of euros”.Second, there’s the more general cover for “business interruption” offered to companies by smaller insurance firms.But if a firm is covered it’s covered, isn’t it?Not necessarily. It all depends on the wording of the inidual insurance contract.But it’s important to bear a broad principle in mind, namely that there’s a difference from the perspective of the insurance company between “definable” and “undefinable” risk.And insurance firms are unlikely to have written an insurance policy that covers a firm from the impact of an undefinable risk.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Think of a hotel that sees its bookings slump because people change their travel plans. Or a company that suffers because it’s staff don’t turn up to work because of illness.Would cutting rates really help the economy deal with coronavirus?In any case, industry experts caution that “notifiable disease” clauses (the classification the UK government updated this week) are not standard in insurance contracts.“Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks, not those that are very unlikely, such as the effects of Covid-19,” said a spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers.So what’s the bottom line: are insurers going to be hit hard or not?Crawford Forensic Accounting Services produced a report last month on the likely impact of coronavirus on the insurance sector.It concluded that “successful claims under business interruption coverage for infection are not common”.Crawford director Frederique Hardy also told The Independent that event cancellation insurance contracts tend to be very bespoke, making it difficult to generalise about the ability of event organisers to make claim.Yet the general view of the industry – at the moment – is that coronavirus is unlikely to result in an explosion of costly payouts.If that’s correct it points to a lot of disappointed firms.And, as a by product, it’s likely to increase further the pressure on governments to give stressed companies economic relief in the form of more time to pay tax and perhaps forbearance on debt repayments to banks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of Australia also cut rates, with investors expecting other major central banks to soon follow suit.Officials and companies in Britain, France, Italy and the United States are struggling to deal with a steady rise in virus infections that have in some cases triggered corporate defaults, office evacuations, and panic buying of daily necessities.The outbreak spread across the United States on Thursday, surfacing in at least four new states.“The interplay of virus containment fears and stimulus measures means that in the near term we expect market volatility to persist,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.Yields on US Treasuries fell to a record low and Treasury futures jumped as investors increased bets that the Fed will follow this week’s surprise rate cut with further easing.The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to a record low of 0.7650 per cent on Friday.Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari said late on Thursday the Fed could cut rates further if needed.Money markets are pricing in another 25 basis-point-cut from the current 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent range at the next Fed meeting on March 18-19 and a 50-basis-point cut by April.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So I felt like a six-year-old. I felt very, very inadequate doing it.”Kristin Scott Thomas on Fleabag, ageing and the horrors of war Thomas’s monologue about womanhood in the second season of Fleabag was extremely popular among fans. You can read the speech in full, below.“Women are born with pain built in. It’s our physical destiny: period pains, sore boobs, childbirth, you know. We carry it within ourselves throughout our lives, men don’t.“They have to seek it out, they invent all these gods and demons and things just so they can feel guilty about things, which is something we do very well on our own. And then they create wars so they can feel things and touch each other and when there aren’t any wars they can play rugby.“We have it all going on in here inside, we have pain on a cycle for years and years and years and then just when you feel you are making peace with it all, what happens? The menopause comes, the f***ing menopause comes, and it is the most wonderful f***ing thing in the world.“And yes, your entire pelvic floor crumbles and you get f***ing hot and no one cares, but then you’re free, no longer a slave, no longer a machine with parts. You’re just a person.”Thomas\u0027s latest role is\u0026nbspin the choir comedy Military Wives, which is out in cinemas now.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No need!!”Another added: “Nah. That\u0027s too far! I kiss my husband on the mouth in front of the kids, but not full on tongues.

Aged 37, she is the first MP of Palestinian descent and the first female Lib Dem MP from an ethnic minority background.

country still deeply split over the decision to leave the European Union, a new poll has suggested.Some 46 per cent of those polled by BMG for The Independent said they would like to rejoin the EU, against 54 per cent who believe the UK should stay out.And there was a deep generational ide, with 63 per cent of 18-24 year-olds, 60 per cent of 25-34 year-olds and 51 per cent of 35-44 year-olds wanting a return to Europe, while 69 per cent of over-65s want to stay out.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile the poll suggests some Remainers have become reconciled to Brexit, there was little sign that the UK’s departure from the EU on 31 January had persuaded the majority to accept leaving.The 46-54 split in favour of staying out indicated a small swing in favour of Brexit since January, when a poll taken a fortnight before departure day found 52 per cent wanting to Remain and 48 to Leave.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with

That is why Liberal Democrats will never stop fighting for Britain to have the closest possible relationship with our European friends.And Naomi Smith, the chief executive of Best for Britain, which campaigned for a second Brexit referendum, said: “There are many and varied reasons Brits are worried about the terms on which we leave the world’s largest single market.“Concerns around job security are there and for some people, particularly young people who have only ever been European Brits, there’s a real sense of loss about what’s just happened.“The Government doesn’t need to pit old against young.\u0026nbsp“If it relaxes its wish for a quick orce it can begin working out how we can retain as many of the benefits of EU membership as possible, giving young people greater security while still getting Brexit done.”The chief executive of the European Movement, Hugo Mann, said: “This poll clearly demonstrates that Boris Johnson does not have a mandate for his destructive Brexit plans. The prime minister is trying to use the election to force through a damaging hard Brexit that will harm our economy and our NHS and limit opportunities for the next generation”.Best for Britain\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the Queen is nothingnot practical.She has learned the lessons of the unedying exits of Princess Diana and the Duchess of York from The Firm and won’t make the same mistake this time.That’s why she quite beautully told Harry:  “You are much loved and will always be welcomed back” — a line that brings tears to the eyes of a  soppy old monarchist like me.The Queen has not accepted that Megxit is permanent and probably never will. Harry needs some time away to explore and live a le where he isn’t playing second fiddle to his father and brother.Duty and the love of his country might just pull him back soon, she hopes.But perhaps the Queen hasn’t factored in the persuasiveness and passion of Meghan — a truly modern woman with very dferent plans for her husband and their “brand”.SOMETHING Kinda Woohoo as Girls Aloud fans like me got fresh hope this week.One of the main obstacles preventing the chart-topping band reuniting has been the feud between the lovely Nadine Coyle and some of the other members.But Kimberley Walsh met Nadine this week and they seemed to be getting along just fine. Of course, the real battle will be getting Cheryl Tweedy on board.Although with her last single peaking at No, I think she might be willing to kiss and make up with Nads too. As the Pussycat Dolls have proven, there’s nothing like an enormous cheque to help smooth over bitter relations.After all, a high-profile pregnancy and cute baby being born at No always lts our collective spirits, right Similar sentiments were expressed when Tony Blair and David Cameron said  their wives were expecting while PM.  The pregnancies of Kate and Meghan were widely celebrated, too.But we are  gripped by a nasty culture war driven by social media.So after the happy announcement, Twitter once again became a hateful cesspit where apparently respectable professionals found despicable ways to slag off a young woman expecting her first baby, to a man she loves, and spout pathetic conspiracy theories.Ironically, many  were  the same crew who have been banging on for  weeks about the need to be kind to those in the public eye.But those rules instituted by the London liberal keyboard warriors only applyyou have the same political views as they do.If you are a Tory or a Brexiteer, or on the right or work for a popular newspaper, you are such an abhorrent human being in the eyes of the likes of Alastair Campbell and Jameela Jamil that you can be torn to shreds without a hint of irony from the perpetrators who are no better than abusive trolls.THE idea that over-weight people need reminding that they’re the  F-wordis nonsensical.If you have been obese and still battle the bulge every day, you’ll know that being the F-word is inside your head every minute.That’s why I embrace the idea put forward in the Pledge To Eradicate Weight Stigma, by Professor Francesco Rubino, from King’s College London, that describing people as fat, overweight and obese is just as debilitating as a racial slur in .Skinny folk convincing themselves that overweight people are McDonald’s-obsessed lazy slobs is offensive and wrong.And that type of outdated approach will do nothing to solve our obesity epidemic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But even there, transport is in a woeful state compared with the capital’s Tube, trains and buses. No wonder, when London has had three times as much transport funding as the rest of England.It is great that the former Red Wall seats which handed the Tories power have forced them to prioritise our “left behind” regions.But it remains scandalous that instead of increasing their productivity, Labour and Tory Governments let them fall even further behind.That ide has become a chasm which our new Chancellor must close.FLYBE’S collapse is a tragedy for its workers and those at airports reliant on it. But it is right that taxpayers did not bail it out.The firm was badly run, was operating on a wing and a prayer and was finally ruined when coronavirus — which has now claimed its first le in Britain — suddenly destroyed demand.Some of its routes are vital to the economy. Those can be subsidised and offered to rivals under public service rules. Others will be snapped up tooenough passengers make them viable.But Labour’s call, for virtually any job losses anywhere to be rescued using public money, is the road to national ruin.FOR three years MPs and their rogue Speaker brought Parliament to its knees by refusing to honour the Brexit vote.Some stuck two fingers up at their own Leave-voting electorates. And while many of the worst offenders were booted out in last December’s election, plenty on the Labour benches survived.Now they are rewarded with a pay rise to nearly £, a year. Inflation is just . per cent. Their hike is . per cent.How can that be justied They all but destroyed the reputation of the Commons. Now they are sitting pretty on salaries three times the national average, plus perks galore.Far too few are worth anything like it.THE growing of lettuce in space is fantastic news for the historic manned Mars mission we may see within  years.It means astronauts can munch fresh leaves, and maybe tomatoes and peppers, all the way to the Red Planet.If they run out, there’s always Mars bars. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The level of uncertainty means it is unwise for it to attempt to settle the big questions on tax, spending and borrowing.One influential Tory source tells me that: “You can’t do spectacular, interesting stuff during corona. But you can do boring and dficult things.”The Budget will concentrate on delivering the Tories’ election promises. Inside the Treasury it has been dubbed the “Manesto Budget”.It will contain changes to ensure that more infrastructure projects are built outside London and the South East, there will be a “Union connectivity” project launched to better link up England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — expect Boris’s bridge to get a mention — it will green-light a slew of road projects, provide money for fast broadband and increase funding for research.It will also curb the entrepreneurs’ tax relief that has turned from being an encouragement to take a risk on a new business to a general form of tax relief for wealthy investors.The Budget will also seek to emphasise that, despite the undoubted, short-term disruption the coronavirus will cause, the medium-term future for the economy is pretty rosy.Unlike with the  financial crash, the economy will rebound strongly once the virus has passed.There is, though, a big debate going on in government about how much the Government should do to help iniduals and businesses through the corona downturn.The rise in the number of people in the UK who are their own boss means there are more than four million workers not entitled to sick pay.The Government will, almost certainly, offer these people more time to pay their taxes. But what more it should do is the subject of growing debate in Whitehall.One of those involved in these discussions points out: “We can’t pay for the whole gig economy for the next six months.”A minister argues that people can get an advance from universal credit within two days in urgent cases. They fear thatthe Government starts paying the wages of the self-employed, then it will be hard to see where it should stop.They point out that a plumber who earns £, a week now, will almost certainly lose money as the virus spreads. Should the State make that up Coronavirus will change the way we live over the next few months, at the very least.But the challenge for the Government is to ensure that work on everything  doesn’t cease while the country tries to fight this crisis.It still has a job of work to do to get the country ready for le outside the EU and to prepare the economy for the great changes that technology is about to bring.BORIS JOHNSON is determined to defend Priti Patel, his Home Secretary, who is facing ious allegations of bullying from civil servants.Internally, he has given short shrt to those who have suggested he distance himself from her.There is a view in Downing Street that several of the most dramatic charges against her don’t stack up.They also claim that these concerns about Patel’s behaviour were not expressed as official complaints at the time.They, “didn’t reach up at a formal level”, I’m told.No knows, though, that it has a fight on its hands to save Patel.One source tells me: “Yes, she can survive. But there’s no smoke without fire. It is shaping up to be quite a big struggle.”Part of the issue is that there is a view among senior civil servants that, given that the top civil servant at the Home Office has quit because of this row, Patel should go too.But Downing Street know thatPatel goes, it would become harder to push reform through the system.One of those at the heart of government tells me: “You can’t have a situation where civil servants get to determine who their Secretary of State is.”The next hurdle for Patel to clear is Sir Alex Allan’s inquiry into whether her behaviour breached the ministerial code.There is a quiet confidence among her allies that while she will receive some criticism from his report, she won’t be found guilty of breaching the code.Buther former Permanent Secretary Sir Philip Rutnam really is determined to take his case to an employment tribunal, then the situation will become far more dficult for the Home Secretary.THERE’S a new political ide: Do you still shake hands or have you started bumping elbows to try to reduce your risk of contacting coronavirus Boris Johnson is still very much a hand-shaker, as is the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock.But some other Cabinet ministers have taken to either nodding politely or bumping elbows.As one of those close to the talks put it: “We’ve told them what we think. Their illusions are disappearing rapidly.”The question now is whether when the EU negotiators turn up in London in less than two weeks’ time, they come with a dferent approach or carry on pushing these ideas.THE local elections in May might have to be postponed because of coronavirus.If the UK’s response to the outbreak is still in the delay phase, continuing with the contests would go against that advice, as it would bring large numbers of people into contact with each other.I understand this option is being discussed in Whitehall, but no decision has been taken.But as one figure in government points out: “We postponed a General Election once because of an epidemic.”The  General Election was pushed back to June from May because of foot-and-mouth disease.Delaying the elections – which will see mayors elected in London, the West Midlands and Manchester among other races – would be a big step, and one the Government would only take with the utmost reluctance.The next few weeks will tell us whether it is necessary or not.- James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only the old, frail and sick, they believe, will die. So there is no need to worry.Let’s park, for now, the fact the virus has already mutated into something more aggressive, which might put more people at risk.We need to listen to the experts not for our own sakes but precisely for those old, frail and sick people in and around our lives.That may mean putting other ­people’s needs before our own. Sadly, that does not come ­naturally to everyone. This is the same mindset that sets some people off bulk-buying food andloo roll.Bulk-buying is the epitome of selfishness — quite the opposite of the spirit that united us during World War Two, when people knew they really were in it together.Stockpiling food takes it away from someone who might need it more. I have faith in the public. And I urge everyone to look at what is happening as an invitation — a challenge to rise to — to work out ways in which we can look after each other a little bit ­better.If you know someone old, frail or sick, find ways to make sure they are OK, rather than thinking: “I’m all right, Jack.”As the coronavirus outbreak ­worsens, Britain’s older generation are expected to be warned to self-isolate and stay at home. So it’s up to all of us to do our bit and visit them now — before social distancing is introduced.Coping with loneliness and isolation is already hard enough for many, so let’s do all we can to show them we care. Meanwhile, follow the advice from Public Health England and protect yourself from getting sick as a way of protecting others.Focus on being a good member of your community, on helping others and being a good neighbour. In that way, perhaps, something positive might yet emerge from a very worrying situation.A recent study found our sense of community spirit is declining, with more than half of those polled admitting they barely say a word to their neighbours and do not feel part of a “good neighbourly community”. Just one in ten volunteers with local groups or charities.What happened to us  How did we become so selfish  This “me, me, me” approach is too prevalent. The cult of the inidual approach has led us to think: “As long as my own nest is feathered, I needn’t care about anyone .”If we want something good to come from all this, let’s pause for thought, change our outlook and start thinking of others before we think of ourselves.A crisis can bring out the best — or the worst — in us. We should work to prioritise kindness and bring out the best in each other. The opposite ups the chances of a crisis becoming a catastrophe.I LOVE the fact Heidi Klum, , is so evidently over the moon about being married to musician Tom Kaulitz,  . . . and he is just as happy.In snaps of the pair having dinner in West Hollywood on Wednesday night, she is beaming with pride.Never mind the -year age gap. They both seem to be having a thoroughly nice time together.THERE is no doubt Megxit has put more pressure on William and Kate to meet the public’s expectations and live their lives in the spotlight.While it’s a huge shame Harry and Meghan felt they had no choice but to leave the country, the Cambridges are stepping up to the plate.On their three-day tour of Ireland they have met hundreds of people and posed for countless selfies during an exhausting itinerary.They have visited mental health charities, met farmers and poured oil on potentially troubled waters by speaking at a reception in Dublin about the “many wrongs” Ireland has suffered and our “complex” shared history.They tried their hand at everything from pulling pints to juggling, all the time with smiles on their faces.Some people think that it must be easy being a royal but I defy anyone to do as much as they do in a day, making people feel at ease in their company and all without grumbling.They make a good team and seem genuinely happy to share their lives with us. They will make a great king and queen.SOBERING findings from the United Nations should give us all pause for thought on International Women’s Day.Nine in ten people around the globe are prejudiced against women, it found.That includes depressing notions such as a university education being more important for men than for women and that blokes are more deserving of the jobswork is scarce.Half of the world’s men AND WOMEN feel that fellas make better political leaders, while more than  per cent feel men make better business executives.It is not wholly surprising, I guess,chaps think that way. But these numbers reflect how a horrying number of women think this way too.I guess this is in part due to the received ideas that have formed the backbone of our culture for far too long. That is something for us all to reflect on and challenge wherever we can from now on.ANY woman over  who feels inadequate looking at the drop-dead gorgeousness of Elizabeth Hurley, , can stop the comparisons.It turns out Liz is human after all. Talking to her old friend Trinny Woodall, Liz revealed that she sleeps in a bra every night to keep her cleavage “high and firm” and keeps gaffer tape in her handbag.Gaffer tape, she says, is the secret to her impressive cleavage when she wears plunging dresses.“I wouldn’t be without it,” she said. “I’m obsessed with it. I use it for everything. I have gaffer-taped my body before and it’s the best. There’s nothing better.”Mind you, Liz also claimed she never exercises. Which just goes to show that much of how we look is down to good fortune . . . and good genes.PERHAPS the best thing about getting married for a second time is this: The pressure to do it any way but your way is OFF.I love the fact that when Kate Garraway renews her vows with husband Derek Draper later this year, she is handing the planning reins for the ceremony to her teenage daughter.What a lovely way for the pair to include her. Although having a -year-old arrange your wedding could be . . . interesting.Some people don’t like the idea of renewing wedding vows. But I think it’s romantic.And since anything goes,my husband Paul and I ever do it, the ceremony will be in Las Vegas . . . with me dressed as Elvis.HOW sad – and how shocking – to read a new report saying hundreds of children died or were victims of abuse and neglect AFTER concerns for their welfare had already been raised with social services.It is incredibly dficult being a social worker. It’s one of the most stressful jobs there is.I sometimes wonder why the extended families of at-risk children are not more involved, often not until its too late.Social workers need more funding, more power to take action and all the training that can be made available to them.Maybe that would encourage more people to go into this vital service.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh James!Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson say the last-minute decision to postpone the film was made “after careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace.”That sounds like the film has been pulled for commercial reasons rather than anything to do with deep concerns about public health.And fair enough — because apart from the makers of hand sanitisers, almost every business is going to take a hard knock from coronavirus.But is putting normal le on hold until the end of the year really the way to deal with coronavirus  Is it ultimately even good for business Struggling luxury car manu-facturer Aston Martin were looking forward to the Bond film boosting their sales — Aston Martin have four cars in Never Say Die — but now the firm will have to navigate most of  without the help of . I had already bought my tickets to see No Time To Die on the day it was scheduled to come out, Thursday, April .Frankly, seeing Ana de Armas as CIA agent Paloma in a cocktail dress slashed to the thigh wielding a semi-automatic felt like just what the doctor ordered in these dficult times.But perhaps the Bond producers are right. Who knows how bad things will be by next month It is possible nobody will feel like going to the pictures at the start of April, not even a hardcore Bond nut like me. This health emergency will get a lot worse before it gets better.But even with the tragic news of the first deaths in the UK, so far we have got off lightly compared with other European countries.Escalation here seems inescapable, evenwe all radically improve our personal hygiene. But whatever happens over the next couple of months, panic will only make it infinitely worse.We must all make our own decisions now about the risks we are prepared to take. But I can’t fight the feeling that James Bond has just wimped out big time.The Queen and  are our most famous British icons, forever linked after their brilliant double-act at the opening of the London  Olympics, when Daniel Craig rocked up at the Palace and the Queenparachuted into the Olympic stadium before the opening ceremony.And it is our -year-old monarch who is showing her nation how to act in the face of coronavirus.With her common sense, her calm and her bravery, the Queen has a lesson for us all. Do everything you can to keep yourself and others safe. But don’t stop living your le.The Queen, I suspect, would approve of Tinder’s advice to users to keep a “social distance” from potential partners.“While we want you to continue to have fun, protecting yourself from the coronavirus is more important,” urges the dating app.That seems like a sensible precaution for all young lovers. More hand sanitiser, darling DOG walker Lucy Hignett, , was understandably shocked and appalled when a parish magazine misprint suggested that her firm, Lead The Way, offered a “dog w***ing” service.Lucy, of Thorndon, Suffolk, said: “It was an absolutely horrendous situation.

Harry, hope you don’t mind me writing this letter.“I hope you didn’t mind me cuddling your we.

Charities are calling for an urgent funding increase to help the country’s  hospices which provide care for more , people a year. The homes for people with terminal and le-limiting conditions rely on voluntary donations for two-thirds of their income. But many are struggling to raise funds at a time when there is an increased demand for their services. The Daily Mirror is campaigning for the Government to double its funding to hospices, end the postcode lottery of hospice care, recruit more palliative care doctors and community nurses and to guarantee that all terminally ill children receive end-of-le care. In a letter to Mr Sunak ahead of next week’s Budget, the charity Sue Ryder says the lack of secure funding is putting care for vulnerable people “at unnecessary risk.” “By providing specialist palliative care, hospices including hospice at home help the wider system by freeing up hospital beds that would otherwise be occupied by people at the end of le. “Yet our financial situation is putting the future of hospices and the people for which we provide essential care at risk,” says the letter from Sarah Gigg, the Director of Nursing at Sue Ryder. The letter continues: “Time is now of the essence.  As this is an area of care that affects everyone with a terminal illness – and as our population ages and palliative care needs increase – I urge you to put in place the necessary funding mechanism to place the sector on a sustainable footing, fit for the future.” NHS England has pledged to raise funding for children’s hospices to £million in  , and the Conservative Party pledged to “support our precious hospices” in its election manesto.  But the charities are warning that this a sticking plaster that does not address the underlying problems. A recent report from Together For Short Lives, a group which represents hospiceusers, warned of a “children’s palliative care workforce crisis”. It said services were at “breaking point” because of a growing shortage of palliative care doctors and nurses. There are just  children’s palliative care consultants in the UK when there should be  to . Meanwhile, one in eight nursing jobs in the sector are currently vacant. The Royal College of Nursing recommends there should be around , community children’s nurses in England, but the NHS only has . A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “End of le care is vitally important, and the NHS is committed to caring for people from cradle to grave. Last year the Prime Minister announced a £million cash injection to protect hospices and palliative care services so people across the country will have the best, most personalised and dignied choices when they die.” OPINION: This is not Dickensian London – it is today in our towns and cities  By Ilora Finlay Baroness Finlay of Llandaff is a crossbench peer and a professor of palliative medicine. The mark of a civilised society is the way it looks after its most vulnerable citizens.  And people are at their most vulnerable when illness, loneliness and poverty combine, and they are facing their own mortality.  At that point, hopes and dreams of being fit and well have faded fast. Increasing numbers of people are now below the line in terms of entitlement to any support funding.  They live in the shadows of doorways, stations and even shelter in bins at night to escape the cold and rain. This is not Dickensian London – it is today in our towns and cities up and down our country.  More and more young adults are finding themselves homeless and caught in the downwards spiral of ill health. Often their only solace is found through their addiction to drugs and alcohol that may have been taken to numb the pain of abuse or trauma they experienced.  And so the downward spiral spins ever onwards. In some parts of Britain hospices, with their specic expertise in looking after people who are dying, have followed those charities that have support the homeless and highlighted their needs for so many years. Some hospice staff have been reaching out to the homeless, dying in hostels, and recognised that care needs to go to the person.  They have also recognised that for someone completely alone in the world their dog may be the most important ‘person’ in their le and the only one they can relate to and trust.  "},{"url":null,"title":"government wont consider delaying brexit","story":"NewsGovernment wont consider delaying Brexit to soften impact of coronavirusChancellor Rishi Sunak said he was ready to take \"targeted measures\" in the Budget to help firms as the crisis grows - but extending the transition period is not on the tableShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video rishi-sunak-chancellor-exchequer-updates-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics government-wont-consider-delaying-brexit-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak told Sky News he was ready to take “targeted measures” in his budget on Wednesday to help businesses get through the outbreak, which could see as many as a fth of employees unable to work. And he said Government was ready to deliver whatever action is required to deal with the crisis. Ministers are reportedly preparing for the death toll from Covid- in the UK to reach as many as ,. Supermarket shelves are being left bare of soap, sanitary products and basic medicines as panic buying grips the nation.And former Tory chancellor Philip Hammond said the spread of the virus has the potential to push the UK into recession, and suggested it could pose a greater risk to the economy than a no-deal Brexit .The ex-MP told the Sunday Times the Government needs to address a critical and structural weakness in just-in-time supply chains, which he said have been exposed by the impact of coronavirus on businesses. But Mr Sunak said delaying the end of the Brexit transition period was not an option. “I think very clearly the PM has been clear we donapost want to extend the transition period, he said. “I think people are fed up of having more delays and having people not doing what they say in this regard.” He added: “When it comes to new trading relationships, that work has been going on for quite a while. “Weaposve been very clear and transparent with business about those and we are actively helping them to manage them.”  Mr Sunak also repeatedly refused to say whether his Budget on Wednesday would stick to the spending rules set out in the party’s manesto before the election.

The Labour leadership favourite said the “burning question” was how to beat the Tories at the ballot box in four-and-a-half years time, acknowledging the party had a “huge job” ahead to rebuild.“Weaposve got to pull together – ided parties donapost win elections. Weaposve got to demonstrate to you and everybody  that we are a really effective opposition,” he told the audience at The Mirror hustings in Dudley, West Midlands. “Weaposre unstoppable when weaposre united. Weaposre responsible for the next leg of the journey. Itaposs up to us.”As the contest to take over from Jeremy Corbyn entered its final weeks, Mr Starmeraposs rivals for the top job Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy used the final major hustings to underline the need to get Labour fighting fit.Wigan MP Ms Nandy said Labour had to hold an “honest reckoning” into why nurses and ex-miners turned away from the party to the Tories in their tens of thousands.She criticised Labouraposs manesto for having “nothing to say” about child hunger, Mr Corbynaposs leadership which “allowed factional war” as well as the partyaposs confused Brexit postion which “played games while the country was ripped apart”.In a reference to Ms Long-Bailey giving Mr Corbyn full marks in an interview, she said: “Itaposs not  out of . We can do better and we will. Weaposll start with honesty. I will never duck the dficult choices.” But she suggested the other contenders were failing to do that. “I will stand up for what is right as I have done all my le and - alone in this contest  - I will tell the truth and will fight for the dficult things that need to happen.”  Left-winger Ms Long-Bailey warned that industrialised areas like the West Midlands had suffered a “loss of faith” in politics over the last  years that only a “democratic revolution” including devolution and investment could restore. “We know the Tories are trying to park their tanks on our lawns and we canapost be complacent about this,” she said. “We know that theyaposre already setting up constituency offices and regional organisers in areas where theyaposve broken down the Red Wall already.“So we need to go toe-to-toe with them. We have to be ruthless and that means making sure that all our campaiging zeal goes into these local elections as though we were fighting a general election . Itaposs that important.”In a wide-ranging debate that covered climate change, crime, education and the NHS, Mr Starmer warned the Labour Party it faces the “challenge of our lives” taking on Boris Johnson over a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States. The shadow Brexit secretary claimed the Prime Minister would rather “rupture our relationship” with the European Union than give up his hope of striking a deal with Donald Trump .He slammed Mr Johnson as a “really dangerous man” who could put workersapos rights, as well as food and environmental standards at risk and do huge damage to British industry. “Thereaposs this suggestion that Boris Johnson is some sort of cuddly clown. But heaposs a really dangerous man on so many issues. Heaposll do great damage and Iaposm very concerned that heaposs willing to rip us out of the EU without a deal. It would be a disaster for manufacturing round here,” he said. In a softening of his position in recent weeks, he refused to rule out campaigning to rejoin the EU at some point in the future – but insisted it was “not a priority for now” as the Leave  Remain argument was over.  “We now need to focus on Johnson and what heaposs going to do. I am convinced, whatever he says, that he will rupture our relationship with Europe and go into a relationship with Trump, with a Trump deal. He added: We have left the EU. Itaposs very important that we all recognise that. We have got the challenge of our lives taking Johnson on over this.I donapost think rejoining is our priority  for now and the immediate future. It’s for our kids to decide what our future relationship is. But his two rivals both rejected the idea that Labour could fight the next election on a  of rejoining the EU. Ms Nandy said: “Iaposd rule it out. We havenapost got the option, weaposve lost that right because we didnapost take the deal that ticked every box that we had about protecting close economic and political cooperation. We refused to do it.” And Ms Long-Bailey added: “It would be absolutely disastrous and think we should be setting out a positive vision now of what Britain looks like outside of the EU.”  All three candidates at Dudley Town Hall said it was time to push the Government further on tackling climate change – saying Mr Johnson appeared to have stalled on the issue. Ms Long -Bailey told the audience “thataposs what weaposre up against” while Ms Nandy said the PM should be “shamed into action” and Mr Starmer added “weaposve got to call them out”. Asked on International Womenaposs Day whether it was time for the Labour Party to finally have a woman leader, Mr Starmer insisted he was an “ally of the feminist movement and a feminist myself”. He added: “Iaposm acutely conscious this isnapost about one inidual. Alongside me will be a team working together.” Ms Nandy claimed it was time to “start calling out” the misogyny that existed among some older male Labour MPs who had suggested she was too inexperienced in Parliament to become leader, even though she had been an MP for  years, half of which she spent on the front bench.  Each of the candidates praised the NHS and its handling of coronavirus but raised concerns over its capacity to cope in the event of a major outbreak. Mr Starmer said: “My we works in the NHS but morale is low in her team because day after day, week after week, they have too much work and not enough funding”. They also attacked the Toriesapos record on schools, with Ms Nandy claiming they had “stripped away” support for children outside of school leaving some in her Wigan seat forced to “scavenge through bins and steal from the canteen” to avoid going hungry.  And they highlighted the lack of workersapos rights in the gig economy. Ms Long-Bailey called for a dedicated Ministry of Emloyment, adding: “Itaposs no dferent from standing at the gates of Victorian Salford Docks to seeyou can get a couple of hours of work. Thataposs got to change”. The deputy leadership candidates also appeared at the Dudley event, with favourite Angela Rayner saying Labour had to “take on” the Tories like she did Nigel Farage in an explosive TV debate during the election and  “talk in the language of the people we represent” to win back Red Wall seats.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock wrote to all MPs and peers last week, finally sparking cross-party talks on how to deal with Britainaposs social care crisis. The German-style tax has been considered for a number of years and is reportedly Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s preferred option. After it was suggested by the Commons Communities Committee in , Mr Hancock said he was “attracted” to the idea.But Barbara Keeley, Labour ’s Shadow Minister for Social Care, said it was not clear the plan would raise enough money to ensure the vulnerable had their costs met.The Government has committed to the principle that nobody should have to sell their home to pay for their care. Currently the elderly have to fund the full cost of their care until their assets - including the value of their home - falls below £,. The ‘Social Care Premium’ plan would see over-s, including retired people - pay into a ring-fenced pot for social care. The pot could then be used to fund cash payouts to allow the elderly to pay carers, including family members. Ms Keeley said: “It’s not clear that this proposal would raise the funding needed for the increased access to publicly-funded care needed to ensure vulnerable people are not left with unmet care needs as they are now. “Labour’s plans for social care reform would cap care costs, support the care workforce and introduce free personal care for older people. “There is already consensus that these are the issues that a plan for social care reform must address and we need to see proposals from the Government that actually tackle these areas.”The proposal is thought to be one of six that was set to be included in the Social Care Green Paper which was promised under Theresa May , but never published."},{"url":null,"title":"couple split up airport board","story":"NewsCouple split up at airport but board flight anyway - with le-changing resultsVet Janey Lowes had a glam WAG le with her professional rugby player boyfriend in Newcastle until she went to save street dogs in Sri Lanka and win at Animal HeroesShareComments\"ByJaney Lowes :,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video wecare-the-story-so-far-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,articleId:,articleTitle:Couple split up at airport but board flight anyway - with le-changing results,articleUrl:https:www.mirror news real-le-stories couple-split-up-airport-board-,headline:mirror_couple-split-up-airport-board,primaryTag:Sri Lanka,publishDate:--,firstPublishDate:--,firstPublishTime::,objectType:article,ownerSite:mirror,sensitiveArticle:,embeddedArticle:,liverpoolStoriesArticle:,axatePaywallArticle:,isHavingCommercialFactBox:,subType:news_story,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news real-le-stories couple-split-up-airport-board-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMy le five years ago is unrecognisable from the one I lead now. Back then, I was a vet working with small animals in my native Newcastle, and living with my professional rugby player boyfriend, Alex. At , I had the career of my dreams, a nice house, a nice car, and no money worries. Le was good. I have wanted to be a vet ever since I was a little girl, one of five kids growing up in Barnard Castle, County Durham. My dad’s family were farmers and I was surrounded by animals, although my first true love was Finn, a brown and white spaniel, who was an abandoned puppy I adopted when I was doing work experience at a vet aged . Finn slept in my bed and I adored him. It was Finn who ignited my strong connection with dogs. After qualying from Nottingham University, I relocated back up north for work and moved in with Alex. We’d been together since I was , he was my soul mate and best friend rolled into one. But things started to go downhill when we lived together. On the outside, we had everything, a seemingly enviable and glamorous lestyle. But I’d come home tired and stressed, and he’d be exhausted from playing rugby full time. It was like the fun was over and we needed to shake things up. We booked a trip to Sri Lanka in May . The holiday was supposed to repair our relationship, but we ended up splitting up at the airport before we even got there! We still went as friends, though, and the country blew me away. The beaches, sunshine, friendly locals and surfing were heavenly. The only problem for me – and it was a huge problem – was the street dogs. They were everywhere! The healthy ones seemed happy enough roaming the streets, but all too often they were mange-ridden or injured. Their soulful eyes followed me asasking for help.  One dog that particularly got to me I called Tom. He was so friendly and trusting. He had a nasty gash under his eye, which would have been simply treated in the UK with a few stitches. I knew that in a tropical climate it would soon be infested with maggots. I didn’t have any of my veterinary kit with me, but I couldn’t leave him like that, so I decided I’d pay for a Sri Lankan vet to treat him. I asked several, but despite me offering to pay, none would agree to treat a street dog, because they weren’t viewed as worthy, which shocked me and I didn’t know what to do. Back home, I couldn’t get poor Tom out of my mind. I started Googling Sri Lankan charities that helped street dogs – my worry was those that I could find had been set up by well-meaning iniduals as opposed to vets. I wasn’t sure their ethics and way of working would align with mine. I was desperate to make a real dference. With Alex and I now split, it would have been easy to move out and carry on with my nice comfortable le, but I realised there was nothing tying me down now. Why not go to Sri Lanka and start treating these animals   I had some savings, I thought I could survive for a year, help some dogs, and then come home. So I spoke to my wonderful manager at the surgery, Nick, about my plan. He was so supportive and even gave £, from the company to help me get started. What a boss! Online, I found a woman called Otara Gunewardene, who’d set up an organisation called Embark, based in the capital Colombo, which helped street dogs. She explained the most useful thing a vet could do was neutering and vaccination, which made total sense to me and I decided to make those the focus of my charity, which I called WECare Worldwide. I tied up the loose ends of my le, sold my car and booked my flight for October . Along with my clothes, I packed surgical kits, bandaging and Manuka honey, which can help with wound management. My family came to wave me off at the airport, and I was excited rather than daunted. Landing in Colombo, in the heat and with the tuk tuks and bustle was a thrill, but I headed straight for Talalla, a beautul beach town in the south where I’d met Tom, the dog with the poorly eye whose photo I had kept with me to remember my mission.  I stayed at a surfing retreat initially, where I’d previously made friends from my holiday with Alex. One of the first dogs I treated was Joy, who had been bitten by another dog and whose wound was crawling with maggots. I tweezed them all out, cleaned her up, and bandaged her. No one had ever seen a bandaged dog before! It was a drop in the ocean, but I felt so happy to have achieved something when she went back onto the street, now wagging her tail. Making the charity a success became my focus. As well as treating the dogs, I taught myself how to build a website, how to fundraise, generate publicity, and all the other things you never think about. I also learned how to speak Sinhalese, and soon understood when locals called me a crazy white dog lady!  I worked and worked. I went from having one tuk tuk driver to now employing  members of staff, including five vets, three nurses and several trainees. In the blink of an eye I’d been in the country a year, then two – and now over five years have passed. Sri Lanka is my home. Since my first patient, maggoty Joy, we have helped around , street dogs – from puppies bitten by poisonous snakes, to dogs who have eaten food laced with explosives. I’ve had to amputate mutts’ legs who’ve been run over, and treat STDs, yes, dogs get them too. I am frequently bitten by dogs, including some with rabies, so I’ve needed jabs that have sometimes made me sick. I’ve contracted mange, as well as ringworm, which isn’t nice. I’ve suffered abuse from locals who think I am mad. But it’s all been worth it. Twice a year I come back to the UK for fundraising, and I’ll go to the dentist, hairdresser and get my legs waxed at the same time. My priorities have changed. I haven’t used a hair dryer or worn make-up during the day for years.  I eat fish, rice, and veggies, but I miss proper chocolate, Wotsits, and cheese, which you can’t get here. Surfing is my therapy, I try to go every day. In  I was thrilled to win Vet of the Year. I came back to Britain for Amanda Holden to present me with a Daily Mirror Animal Hero Award. Alesha Dixon and Laura Whitmore were lovely. Then last year, I featured on C’s Ben Fogle’s Lives In The Wild. His dad is a vet and Ben was so supportive and kind.

The plea comes as coronavirus concerns mean essentials such as toilet paper, hand sanitiser and pasta are in huge demand. But the knock-on effect is that vulnerable people, who are unable to leave their homes as frequently, are now being left without food, the Daily Star reports . The Facebook post, which has gone viral, read: I was just at Aldi with my daughter buying bananas and while waiting in a very long line, I met an eldery man who was doing his usual weekly shop. He was very confused and stressed and had been to two supermarkets already before Aldi to find ious things.

Lisa Egan, whose -year-old father is on board the ocean liner, called for the ship to be evacuated as she feared for his health amid the vesselaposs coronavirus outbreak. She told the : Keeping people on board is going to be a death sentence for many. Although the ship is due to dock in Oakland, Calornia, on Monday, only passengers requiring treatment and state residents will be allowed to disembark. It is not known what will happen to passengers from other countries.Justine Grfin, from Coventry but living in Leicestershire, was travelling on the ship with her husband Dave and friends Jan and Allen Duffin, and Sharon and Steve Lane, when the ship was placed under quarantine. The couple renewed their vows on board for their th wedding anniversary. Mrs Grfin told the Press Association: We wonapost be getting off tomorrow as we are at the bottom of the list. First the sick then Calornians, then any other Americans. They have no plans for international passengers yet - rumours going round about Texas but nothing concrete yet.  The couple have not been tested for the coronavirus but believe they will have to enter quarantine in the UK for a further two weeks when theyhome. The longer it takes to get us to England the longer weaposre away from our family. We both have medical appointments to attend, and Dave is having a shoulder replacement operation. Iaposve just got in contact with our MP back in England to try and see whataposs happening. We have been told nothing from the English government or embassy. The international number my sister contacted back home said they would call back in eight hours - that was two days ago.  I had to tell my youngest child Iaposm not coming home and I donapost know when I will be. He was so upset - heaposs only eight and weaposre his special s so he doesnapost deal well with things changing, itaposs heart-breaking. She said an announcement came while the couples were on deck, that the Grand Princess had been forbidden to dock in San Francisco amid evidence that the vessel was the breeding ground for a cluster of nearly  cases of Covid- that had resulted in at least one death after a previous voyage. She said: It came over the ship sound system and we were given an hour to get lunch, which was like a cattle market, and then get back to our cabins. It is very scary but angry as well. We were going to Singapore and Thailand and Bali on a cruise but it was cancelled the week before we were due to go. This cruise was the only one we could get that would work out with work and childcare arrangements. They quarantined the other people who had been on the overlapping cruise the day before us in their rooms so they should have told us then so we could have quarantined ourselves sooner. I have rheumatoid arthritis and take immuno-suppressant drugs, so Iaposm waiting to hearI can still take them.The couple are in a room next to two of their friends, Mr and Mrs Lane, so they are able to speak across the balcony ider. Both women are self-employed and Mrs Grfin said: If we donapost work, we donapost get paid. The ship is operated by Princess Cruises, who also own the Diamond Princess, which was placed under quarantine in Japan last month. More than a quarter of the , people on board - around  passengers - eventually became infected. On board the Grand Princess, Jackie Bissell, from Dartford in Kent, said passengers had been given little information on what will happen next.  We are waiting for the shipaposs captain - but I think heaposs as much in the dark as we are and heaposs said heaposs only giving us information as and when he gets it, she told Radio aposs Today Programme on Saturday.

Beaming Meghan matched his scarlet jacket in a red caped gown, looking relaxed as the couple prepare to start their new le in North America. They are said to be looking to set up a permanent base in either in Toronto, where the American former actress lived before royal le, or the millionaires’ ­playground of Montecito in Calornia. The celebrity hotspot is home to chat show queen Oprah Winfrey – a guest at the couple’s wedding in  – and TV host Ellen DeGeneres, another friend of the Sussexes. Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland also lives nearby in Los Angeles. Harry, , was in unorm last night in his role as Captain General of the Royal Marines, a title he will give up along with the rest when he steps back from royal duties on March . Once stripped of his Armed Forces appointments he will be barred from wearing the unorm – and he is expected to wear a civilian suit at his final engagement tomorrow. After that the couple are expected toto Canada early next week to be reunited with -month-old son Archie, who is currently in the care of a nanny at the family’s rented home on Vancouver Island. It follows weeks of tension at the Palace and in the Royal Family as the couple prepare to build a new le away from the royal fold.The Sussexes closed their ­Buckingham Palace office and sacked their  loyal staff last month, not offering to take any of them into their new le. Meghan also upset ­courtiers by reneging on a deal to not publicise private visits to her patronages while other senior royals had important jobs on the same day. On Friday she placed images in a London newspaper and on Instagram of her at the National Theatre when the Duchess of Cornwall was continuing her vital campaign on domestic violence. It came after she publicised a visit to the Mayhew animal charity last month, the day Prince Charles made a keynote speech on climate change in front of world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. A Palace source said: “To say there’s been a degree of tension would be an understatement.” But last night Meghan looked ­glowingly happy in a £, red gown by London-based label Safiyaa, with a matching £, clutch bag by Manolo Blahnik and long red crystal earrings by Simone Rocha. She and Harry seemed relaxed as they met current and former servicemen and women at the Royal Albert Hall for the Mountbatten Festival of Music, raising money for the Royal Marines Charity and children’s cancer charity CLIC Sargent. A royal source said: “The military is very important to both the Duke and the Duchess. His connection with the Armed Forces is something he cherishes while the Duchess has sup-ported the armed forces in the US since before she joined the family, and now in the UK alongside her husband. It’s something they’ll continue to do.” Harry, who took over the Royal Marines title from Prince Philip in , was devastated when told he would have to give up his cherished military roles as part of the deal to resign from royal le.  But after seeing him so upset, the Queen agreed to a -month review process to see how he adapts to his new le. Insiders have said the plan was to “leave the door open for him toto royal duties in some capacity in the future”. A royal source said: “The Queen is extremely fond of Harry and Meghan and wants only the best for them. She has been very close to her grandson since the death of Princess Diana and has found the isions between the Sussexes and the rest of the family a very testing time. “Some in the Palace are very surprised by Harry’s chosen path and feel he will be very lonely away from his family, away from all he has known.

The couple plan to tackle issues such as medical care and homelessness for veterans and injured service personnel, both in the UK and the United States. A well-placed source with knowledge of the new venture told the Mirror the couple want to “collectively make a change in the armed forces arena”. Palace insiders said the move to celebrate and assist the military would be “hugely welcomed” by the Queen. On Monday Harry and Meghan will stand alongside the Queen, Prince Charles and we Camilla, Prince William and we Kate, at the annual Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey. It is their last official engagement before they step down as working royals on March . The Queen asked them to join the family at the service before they bow out to begin a new le in Canada with their -month-old son, Archie. Their presence at the church service yesterday showed they have built bridges with the Queen and wider family since announcing their decision to walk away from royal le two months ago. Prince Harry , , looked relaxed as he drove Meghan, , to the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park.Harry, who did two tours of Afghanistan during his time in the forces, was devastated when the Queen told him he would have to step back from his military positions after leaving The Firm. Harry will no longer use HRH or his honorary military title as Captain General of the Royal Marines.  But a source said: “Harry has vowed he will never walk away from his ­military friends and comrades. “Giving up his military roles has been the hardest thing for him, and the Queen, Charles and William say how much that connection means to him, which is why there will always be a way back for him.”  The Queen has left the door open for the couple toto royal duties, suggesting a review after  months. The source said: “Meghan also wants Harry to keep up his associations with the armed forces as he was devastated by having to step back from the one part of royal le he liked. “A path has been set for him toto take on those duties againhe wants it.”  The couple got a standing ovation at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday as they made their last official military engagement at a musical festival to raise money for the marines and a ­children’s cancer charity.And at the Endeavour Fund Awards for injured service personnel last week, Harry told the military crowd: “I’ve always got your back.” He said: “I feel lucky to be able to count myself as one ofyou and am deeply proud to have served among you as Captain Wales.”He will continue his association with the Invictus Games, the sporting event for injured military personnel which he set up in . More than  competitors from  nations will take part in the games in May, at The Hague in the Netherlands.  Meghan had an association with the military before she met Harry, having ­travelled to Afghanistan in  with the United Service Organisations, which supports the military and their families around the world.In November, she and Harry visited the Broom Farm Community Centre, just a few minutes from Frogmore Cottage , their home in Windsor, and spent time with the families of army personnel deployed overseas.A source close to the couple said: “They were blown away by the resilience of the families, what they have to endure through time apart and the hardships they sometimes suffer.  “Now they have the chance to help and raise the profile of issues that matter to them.” On their website, they told how they “intend to develop a new way to effect change and complement the efforts made by so many excellent foundations globally”. The venture would be in addition to their “cause driven work”, such as issues around education for all, animal conservation and climate change.

The monarch, , asked the the couple to join her at The Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will officially step back from royal duties following engagements for Commonwealth Day. “It was a really sweet gesture that the Queen asked them to church,” a source told PEOPLE. “It’s telling in the sense that these two are still her family. And as a family, they all love each other.” The Queen wore sunglasses and a pale blue outfit as she was seen arriving at the venue. Meghan and Harry looked happy and relaxed as they were escorted to the church. In January, the couple said they would be moving to Canada and stepping back from royal le in a bombshell announcement that stunned senior royals.  But they were forced to ditch plans for a aposSussex Royalapos brand after reaching an agreement with the Queen over their status. The Queen has previously said: “Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family.  “I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent le.  I want to thank them for all their dedicated work across this country, the Commonwealth and beyond, and am particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family. It is my whole family’s hope that today’s agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new le.” Yesterday, Meghan Markle urged schoolchildren to stand up for your rights during a speech at Robert Clack Upper School in Dagenham, east London.Her comments have been seen as a signal to the Palace as they echo her own battle to quit the Royal Family.

Here is Meghan Markleaposs final speech as a senior in full Good afternoon, everybody. I thought you knew I was coming so Iaposm sorry for the surprise. It is such an honour for me to be here today. When we thought about what I wanted to do for International Womenaposs Day this year, for me it was incredibly important to be with the women of our future. And that is all of you young women here, as well as you young men who play a very large part in this. I think specically coming to your school made a lot of sense for me because of this social justice and the impact that itaposs rooted in.  Your school mantra as you all know is excellence for all, excellence from all, right. Sothataposs the case, how does that apply in your minds do you think to International Womenaposs Day  I think in many ways itaposs very much the same thing isnapost it, the idea of excellence for all and from all, equality for all and from all. Before I continue Iaposm going to go off the cuff here because I do think whataposs really key isthereaposs one brave young man in this room who wants to come and say what he thinks the importance of International Womenaposs Day is, I know thereaposs going to be one of you. Meghan picked a volunteer from the audience, -year-old Aker Okoye, who discussed the importance of men supporting International Womenaposs Day - after first saying the duchess is beautul. Afterwards, Meghan continued: Well done, very well said, and incredible confidence, donapost you all agree   I think that is the point, right  In many societies, it doesnapost matter where you are, itaposs very easy to sometimes compartmentalise or silo this idea of International Womenaposs Day solely being about women - but itaposs not, itaposs about all of us. So I think what you said is incredibly important for all of us to remember, not just on Sunday, not just on International Womenaposs Day, but every day to remember the value that we all bring to the table. And I think being able to be in Dagenham is incredibly profound because as you can see with Geraldineand the other women who had the strength to really stand up for something that they knew needed to be done is the best example of no matter how small you might feel, how low you may feel on the ladder or the totem pole, no matter what colour you are, no matter what gender you are, you have a voice and you certainly have the right to speak up for what is right.  And I think whataposs really key for all of you to remember is especially looking at the people who have paved the way for you to get to this point in your lives and be able to have the access that you do, itaposs not just an opportunity to continue that, itaposs a responsibility. So I just encourage and empower each of you to really stand in your truth, to stand for what is right, to continue to respect each other, for you young men to continue to value and appreciate the women in your lives and also set the example for some men who are not seeing it that same way.

One of the greatest reporters of his generation, Syd, as he was universally known, died in hospital on Friday with his beloved family by his side. Tributes have flooded in for Young, who worked for the Mirror in New York, Belfast, London, Manchester and the West Country.Close friend and former Tony Blair spokesman Alastair Campbell said: “He was a great reporter, but more than that he was a wonderful man.“What made him a great reporter was that he loved stories and he loved people. What made him a great man was that love for people, and a zest for le. “I am one of many, many young reporters Syd took under his wing. “He was one of le’s givers. There in the good times, and the bad. I will miss him hugely.” Piers Morgan said: “Syd Young wasn’t just a Daily Mirror legend, he was a Fleet Street legend. “He was a brilliantly inquisitive and persistent journalist with a fabulously well-honed nose for a cracking story, and a wonderful character, beloved by his colleagues.” Daily Mirror editor Alison Phillips said: “Syd was a true Daily Mirror legend. “He was a fantastic reporter - one of the very best of his generation. “He was a much loved and respected reporter throughout Fleet St and he will be very much missed.”Syd was always proud to call himself “a Mirrorman” and still attended the annual reporters Christmas lunch in Fleet St. Indeed, he served the paper he loved dearly for  years before his retirement in . Young was particularly proud of his roots in Manchester, where he hailed from the working class streets of Ancoats at a time the city was a mighty hub of Britain’s newspaper industry. Posted to Northern Ireland, he earned deserved distinction from his coverage in the early s of the savagery surrounding the erupting terrorist campaign, when bombings and shootings became a brutal fact of daily le. Next came a dream move to the United States and a prize role in the Mirror’s bustling New York bureau. “I always wanted to go to America, the original land of opportunity, and I made it,” he commented later. The moved allowed him a front row seat at historic events, including the fall of US President Richard Nixon.

It should have landed in Beijing, China, later that day but instead disappeared less than an hour after take-off. The wreckage of the Boeing  has never been found, nor has any trace of the passengers and cabin crew on board. Debris began to wash up on beaches across the Indian Ocean more than three years after the plane vanished. Heartbreakingly, the search for the missing jet was called off in  - but there are still no answers as to what actually happened to Flight MH. Conspiracy theories surrounding the plane circulated almost as soon as it went missing. Did the pilot deliberately change the course in a gruesome murder suicide or was the plane hijacked  Were its controls remotely hacked and was it landed safely outside of the radar that should have been tracking it. MH set off in a normal take-off from Kuala Lumpur but  minutes into the flight it made its final communication with air traffic control. It disappeared from conventional radar minutes later but was tracked by military systems for another hour, where it seemed to be deviating from its planned flight path. Journalist Ean Higgins author of The Hunt For MH believes he knows exactly what happened to the jet. Amateur detective Mick Gilbert came up wth the theory, although there is no concrete evidence that this is what happened. He claims there was a devastating blaze in the planeaposs cockpit around  minutes into the flight when the windshield heater on the pilotaposs side caught fire. Ean says this cold have burned out some circuits, including the secondary radar transponder and the communication systems. Pilots are trained for emergencies just like this and would have simply put on their oxygen masks and cut the power to the heater. But Ean claims this led to a catastrophic chain of events that caused the deaths of everyone on board. By cutting power, the crew would also have switched off the satellite data unit, which meant they were no longer linked to satellites. Ean then believes the First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, will have been the one in charge of the plane while Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah dealt with the blaze. As soon as the fire was under control the captain and first officer would have made a distress call. Emergency training for pilots stresses that making sure the plane remains airborne and finding a course for the nearest airport are the two initial priorities in an in-flight emergency. The third is to radio for help and to let air traffic control know what is happening, which means the plane could have changed route without anyone on the ground being aware. However, Ean believes that during the crisis, one of the oxygen masks the two pilots were wearing was yanked out of its socket. The cockpit would then have been filled with the contents of the oxygen bottle, which is a highly flammable gas, and could easily cause an explosion. Captain Zaharie was already on his feet and trying to deal with the flames - but First Officer Fariq would have been incinerated as he tried to control the plane. An explosion of this size would have weakened the windshield of the aircraft, which would in turn have caused a rapid decompression. In these situatons, oxygen masks would fall from the overhead compartments, giving passengers  minutes of air in the out of control plane. Ean then says Captain Zaharie could have fled the cockpit to reach an oxygen mask before he fell unconscious before making his way back into the front of the plane. With the communication equipment destroyed in the explosion, the captain then had a truly horrying decision to make. He had just minutes of oxygen left and many of the passengers were dead or already in comas as their air supply ran out. Captain Zaharie could either try to crash land over Penang, a heavily built up area, and possibly save himself and the flight attendant who had helped him back into the cockpit but at huge risk to the thousands of people on the ground.

Despite extensive searches of thousands of miles of the sea, the wreckage of the doomed plane has never been found. Then, more than three years after it vanished, pieces of debris believed to be from MH started to wash up on beaches in the Indian Ocean. By , the search for the missing aircraft was finally called off with no answers as to what had actually happened to the plane and everyone on board. Ever since it vanished from the skies, theories about what happened to MH have circulated. Did the pilot deliberately change the course in a gruesome murder suicide or was the plane hijacked  Were its controls remotely hacked and was it landed safely outside of the radar that should have been tracking it. The last communication air traffic control had with MH was  minutes after it had taken off from Kuala Lumpur and was on its way to Beijing. It disappeared from conventional radar minutes later but was tracked by military systems for another hour, where it seemed to be deviating from its planned flight path. And one mystery that has long puzzled some investigators is the presence of an additional, unaccounted for, extra passenger. The planeaposs logs had  passengers and  crew listed on board but Andre Milne, a volunteer investigator, claims he has found evidence of an extra person on the aircraft. But the official record for those missing stands at  - not the  total it should have been. Mr Milne said: The extra passenger likely acted in conjunction with larger operational support to take full command and control of the cockpit of MH. The official MH safety investigation team have always insisted the extra passenger was simply a discrepancy. The list had been loaded onto a computer about two hours before take-off. A spokesman said: The actual figures can dfer from that transmitted on the load sheet due to last minute changes. Last month, former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, claimed Malaysiaaposs government secretly believed very early on the MH mystery was a mass murder-suicide orchestrated by the captain. The captain of the Boeing  was Zaharie Ahmad Shah who has been accused of hijacking the aircraft and crashing it in the remote Indian Ocean in a carefully planned plot.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.51195024-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.51195024-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.51195024-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.51195024-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"charity looking for more fundraisers as demand increases","story":"A children#s charity has launched an appeal for fundraisers to help cope with its rapidly-expanding service.Over the last few years Help for Kids has expanded and the charity supports hundreds of youngsters across Dundee and Perth.One youngster received an iPad and wheelchair from the charity while  year old Liam Kidd will receive a special tricycle.His mum Samantha Middleton, said the trike would provide Liam, who is autistic and unable to speak with more freedom.She said: #It will get him out an about more.

We’ve not been beaten in the last few games but it’s important to turn the draws into wins.“We created a number of chances against Alloa on Tuesday night. We just need to put those away going forward.“Alloa was a crazy game. When you look back at how many chances we created – good chances too. In a normal game they go in and it’s -.“It’s one of those things. We’ve taken a lot of positives from it and we’ll take them into the Ayr game.“I’m surprised, from the way I’ve seen us play, that we’re not further up the league.“The squad is a really good one. I thought: ‘It’s going to be really hard to get in the team in the first place,’ but, luckily enough, I was there within a game.“It’s important as a team that we stick together now and try to get as many points on the board as we can between now and the end of the season.”The consistency of James McPake’s recent team selections has translated into improved – and further improving – performances.The -- system employed by the Dee boss since the - draw away to Greenock Morton in early February seems to suit his players.For Elliott, that tactical comfort is a huge positive.“Everyone on the pitch knows their role,” he said.“Defensively, everybody knows what they need to be doing. We defend as a team. But we’ve also created a number of chances in each and every game I’ve played.“It’s important now that we keep going and keep building on the positives we’re taking from each game.“If you get a few wins together you never know how far you can push your way up.”A pair of wins in the next four days against Ayr would be a big ask but it would do the Dee cause the world of good.They would probably settle for four points.But you won’t catch anyone at Dens admitting it.“These games are massive,” said Elliott.“You look at other teams within the league, below you, and they still have an opportunity to finish in the play-offs, so it’s vital we keep picking up wins. But there’s confidence in the dressing-room. In all the games I’ve played, we’ve created loads of chances.“It’s important we keep doing that, keep doing the other things we’re good at, and get three points on the board whenever we can.”Come the end of the campaign, Dundee will have the option to extend Elliott’s stay at Dens.Whatever happens between now and the end of the season, that’s something the -year-old hopes they take up.“I just want to play games and do well for the club. If they like me, the ball’s in their court,” he said.“But as I said, I’ve enjoyed my time since I’ve been here.

We just need to focus on our own business.“We need to find those performances and results again.“Every game is going to be tough and Inverness are going to push it all the way.“They need to keep winning and hope we keep slipping up, but there’s nine games to go and we just need to look after our own business.“We’re still only a few wins away from it so we just keep taking it one game at a time as our focus turns to Partick tomorrow.“This league is tough. It’s dficult just now but the run we were on was unbelievable.“To go those  games unbeaten was incredible and that’s what got us that cushion.“Everybody is capable of beating each other and it’s never an easy night.“We went down to Ayr and they’re a good side, pushing for second place. They’re having a good season, have good players and are playing some nice football.“We knew it was going to be tough with Inverness winning but they’ll need to keep plugging away.” vw, px\"  Of their own dip in form since the turn of the year, Reynolds added: “It is frustrating but it’s a long season with injuries, change of personnel and teams are fighting for their lives.“Every team knows they need to get something and they want to slow us down. It’s a cup final when teams play us. Inverness felt that when they played us the other week and it was the same for Ayr.“It’ll be a tough run-in with people taking points off each other but we just need to keep plugging away and re-focus.“Luckily, our schedule goes from weekend to weekend from now on so we can hit every game fresh, with teams coming in with strained squads playing Saturday-Tuesday.”Reynolds admits United are eager to get back on home soil after some tough games on the road.“Tannadice has been a good place for us and we’re looking forward to getting back on a nice pitch.“The pitch down at Ayr held up well considering the amount of rain we’ve had but it’s nice to get back home.“We need to keep going and pushing to make sure we get three points. I think there’s pressure on every game, home and away, when you play for Dundee United.“We’re coming into every game as the league leaders and it’s been like that all season, but we’ve managed to handle it so far.“We go into every game confident we can win but we know that’s not going to happen. If you’re not on it, it can be tough.

Hopefully by providing the van it has helped the AberNecessities team do this.”Danielle added: “The van has been a total game-changer.“It’s altered the way we approach the movement of supplies between our drop-off points and allows us to get them out to the children who need it faster than ever.“We’re going to keep supporting families and giving a voice to our youngest and most vulnerable people in the city.“We plan to continue to grow so we can support each other as best we can.”She added: “I’m excited to see what the future holds for AberNecessities as we continue to expand and hopefully are able to help more children and families than ever this year.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50896237-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50896237-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50896237-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50896237-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"road partially blocked at aberdeen beach after collision","story":"An Aberdeen road has been partially blocked following a two vehicle crash.Police were called to Beach Bouled this afternoon just before pm..The road has been partially blocked as recovery is on its way for the two vehicles.There are not thought to be any injuries.A police spokesman said: #We were called at .pm to a two vehicle road crash, with the road blocked.#Recovery has been called and cars can pass through with care.#"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor january 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,in  The Argyllshire Advertiser ran a story entitled #Skate park pipe dream a reality for Lochgilphead#. Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

The glass came well back. At a quarter to eight we heard a poor weather forecast with gales and rain for practically every area including north-easters for both Malin and Hebrides. In the news that followed we heard that Moyanawas in trouble on her way home and was asking for help as she would have to be abandoned.As there was no hurry about moving as we meant to wait for the flood and there was obviously little enjoyment to be had on deck we turned over and went to sleep again. We hoped to make Tobermory in the late afternoon having the flood with us all the way andthings got no worse.At half past nine we began to turn out. A cold strong north-westerly was blowing but it was dry. Seewolf had sailed for Oban but Lindisfarne was still with us with Guy still shoutingand singing with undiminished enthusiasm. The Saguenay was not happy – a man was crouching in her cockpit with the lead line in his hand keeping watch for the first sign of dragging.We had a breakfast of grapefruitand bacon and eggs. One of the eggs when broken into a cup was so rotten it nearly blew the Pilot out of the forecastle.After our meal we had a big clean up above and below and the Tar pumped the ship then, with the wind falling light, the rain started again and blankets etc. up on deck to air had to come down in a hurry, but the glass was beginning to show signs of being somewhere near the bottom for the time being.The Tanky and Tar took shelter in the dog-house with the Major and talked of this and that while the rest of us occupied ourselves below. The Bosun and Pilot finished putting the tacklines in the flags, the former got a book while the latter started sketching. The Skipper had a patent lighter that could be used in any weather no matter how blowy or how wet, but which, when working emitted a series of sparks and this was the subject of one of the sketches. The Mate fitted up a tumbler holder in the ladies cabin then did some knitting, the Skipper, after cutting the tacklines to the requiredhad a snooze.At two o’clock by which time it was calm and raining less heavily, the Tanky and Mate started getting our dinner of lamb salad, greengages and custard, coffee and Yo-Yo biscuits, ready and the Pilot and Skipper tried mixing gin and Dubonnet but decided that to do so merely spoilt good gin. The Tanky, however, seemed to enjoy Dubonnet by itself and she was given the freedom of the bottle. About this time the man in the Saguenay got tired of holding his lead line and he shted billet to inshore from us.When we started lunch it was almost a flat calm, but coming on deck after it ready to go onto Tobermory, we found the wind had risen considerably and had veered a point. We got our anchor at four o’clock and under engine went out into the Sound of Mull and, turning west, began to get up our sails as we passed the Morven Pier.In view of the forecast and of what we could see ahead of us we decided to tie down two reefs. We got the tack and clew lashed down and had started on the reef points when we began to doubt the wisdom of proceeding. The wind was fresh and getting stronger every minute and the sea was increasing similarly – to go on would mean getting a proper hammering and the prospect of a north-east gale would mean our intended anchorage in Tobermory would probably be most uncomfortable .The decision of whether to turn back or not was left to the Skipper for as usual, on these occasions, the Pilot steadfastly refused to offer any opinion, but he did agree that the Skipper was right when he decided on the former course. Round we came, the jib was broken out, and we scampered back to Loch Aline. At the narrows the jib was furled and under engine only we ran up to Kinlochaline and let go off the boat-house at ten past five. The Mate, Tanky, and Tar, down below and unaware of our change of plan were quite bewildered when they heard the chain run out and the first named came on deck to find out where we had got to.The Saguenay had preceded us to this anchorage and the Lindisfarne came up a little later and Guy said that Kyle Bay, in the rapidly rising gale, was getting almost untenable. In Kinlochaline we were very comfortable though, even here there was quite a lop on the water and we were sheering about a good deal in the squalls. It was raining very heavily but the Bosun took the Major ashore, but still without any concrete results.At six we had a cup of tea with cake and biscuits and by the time this was finished it was blowing a full gale. The weather forecast was bad and our only consolation was that it was ever so much worse for the South.In the Channel the barometer had reached a record low level for July and force  and  winds were commonly reported all over England and Wales. With us the glass had turned and was . up since mid-day. Then with the exceptions of the Bosun who was in the dog-house and the Tar who played patience we spent the next hour or so dosing in the cabin.At half past eight we had a supper of scrambled eggs and meat roll for those that wanted it, then we put up the tents and down the angel and veered a further five fathoms of chain, making it twenty out in three fathoms of water.We could see out in the Sound of Mull that a huge sea was running and down by the narrows the top of the water was being swept off in spindrt. The squalls where we were were very fierce but, there being no sea, we were lying quite comfortably and never once put a pull on the anchor though we did suffer rather badly from bobstayitis.Two motor boats came up for shelter. One, Ormidale, anchored off the west shore opposite us, but the otherlet go out in the middle of the loch and kept steaming to her anchor for as long as we could see her.It was a wild night and at eleven o’clock to cheer himself up the Bosun made coffee for himself and the Pilot and half a cupful for the Tanky. While they were having it the rest of us started to turn in.That gale was news and in our sheltered corner we had no idea how bad it was. Even in Crinan warps were carried away and yachts set adrt in the basin. All round the coast were reports of vessels in distress one, a steamer in the Channel, being rolled right over.Next week:"},{"url":null,"title":"pedal power at macpool","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt was with trepidation I arrived at Mid Argyll Community Poolahead of the aqua bike try-out session [writes Rachel Carruthers].Exercise classes and I don#t often seem like a natural fit but I was excited to give the new craze a go.Aqua cycling uses stationary bikes immersed in a swimming pool, with water up to participants# waists, making it a non-weight bearing exercise.Aqua bikes can be used at all abilities and are often used in high intensity classes, giving a vigorous cardiovascular workout in a low impact environment # an ideal way to reduce obesity and prevent ill health.Stationary cycling and water-based exercises are also frequently recommended for patients suffering with osteoarthritis or recovering from knee and hip surgery or injury, therefore combining both is an obvious step.MACPool successfully applied for funding through the Argyll and Bute HSCP Self Management Fund to run the All Ability Cycling Project in partnership with Cycling UK and the Ardrishaig Bothy. As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin. The duo first meet when stowing themselves away on the cruise liner, and their hare-brained schemes get them into some serious trouble, but also provides plenty of entertainment.A notable performance comes from Holly Nichol, who makes her GAOS principal role debut as the feisty and sassy nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney. Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC. Kick-off is pm with Kintyre Park the expected venue.

carers and the wider community, who have all contributed to this journey.ldquoWe are keen to continue our progression and plan to focus on our vision and values, ensuring the best outcomes for all of our young people.The inspection, carried out by Carol McDonald, notes: ldquoSince her appointment in August , the new headteacher has led important improvements in the work of the school.ldquoShe has won the confidence and respect of staff and parents.ldquoShe is providing clear strategic direction for change and improvement.ldquoThe senior leadership team are working well together and providing

They felt a pleasure in being immersed and connected to the le that swum and floated around them. ldquoBeing in the landscape, in nature, is a key thing about swimming in the sea for me, said East Lothian swimmer Lil Vischer, ldquoand itrsquos the one landscape you can get into, right up to your nose. A complete immersion.Our book looked at some of the research into what plunging into chilly water and exposing yourself to sudden cold water shock was doing to us physiologically, and how that might link with its increasingly vaunted physical and mental health benefits. We also touched briefly on how time spent in nature is being shown, in a myriad of ways, to be good for us. In Shetland, GPs have been authorised to give \"green prescriptions\" such as rambling or bird-watching . As a society we are waking up to the fact that stepping outside and finding some green space, might be not just be enjoyable, but therapeutic. A new book on the subject, by Isabel Hardman, is even catchily titled The Natural Health Service.Next weekend, a clutch of authors who have an interest in the kind of nature-connecting activities are speaking at Aye Write ndash these include Alice Vincent, author of the millennial gardening memoir Rootbound: Rewilding A Le, Lucy Jones, Anna Deacon and myself, as well as Gregory Kenicher, author of Scottish Plant Lore.But connecting to nature doesnrsquot have to involve a long hike in the hills, or plunge in a river ndash it can be done closer to home. Rootbound author Alice Vincentrsquos rewilding has been in urban gardening. ldquoI couldnrsquot leave London. My le was in the city, my support network was there, and I found greater excitement and reassurance in seeing plants thrive in the cracks in the concrete and being able to tend a tiny little plot. Gardening, she says, ldquoslowed me down, offered me a kind of meditation that I couldnrsquot find anywhere  in my le.One person who has looked more deeply than most into this question of the science of why we respond as we do to nature, is Losing Eden author Lucy Jones. Her journey into researching why we feel better when we take a break in some green space, or wander along a beach, or tend a garden, began with her own rewilding. Jones turned to nature, to long walks in Walthamstow Marshes, as her a healing form of rehab following drug and alcohol addiction. She writes, beautully, \"Nature picked me up by the scruff of my neck, and I rested in her teeth for a while.\"The research she discovered on why being in nature is good for us was hugely erse. ldquoMy mind was blown by the iety and depth of the evidence , she says.She delved into studies in the field of biophilia ndash biologist EO Wilsonrsquos term for the idea that we have an innate affinity to other le, and are drawn to living things, and that is an expression of our genes. Jones was interested in why, for instance, we were attracted to certain landscapes, trees, or vistas. ldquoOne of the things that I personally noticed was that there was a sprawling, dark yew tree in the entrance of the cemetery and very time I went under this quite thick, deep canopy, I always felt like I had taken a split-second yoga class.When she looked at studies around tree shape, she found research by Gordon Orians at the University of Washington, that showed we prefer trees that are the same shape as those that would have helped us, by offering shelter and safety, in our evolutionary history. ldquoThese are trees, she says, ldquowith a broad canopy that spreads in width further than its height and it has umbrella-like branches and small leaves.That sense of biophilia is also there in our feelings about open waters. The idea that we have a ldquoblue mind that responds to being near water, was popularised by Wallace Nichols, in his book The Blue Mind: he Surprising Science That Shows How Being Near, In, On, or Under Water Can Make You Happier, Healthier, More Connected, and Better at What You Do. Even looking at images of water relaxes us. Project Soothe, a study at Edinburgh University, has been finding that many of the images we find most relaxing and soothing are those involving water.Jones discovered that MRI scans are showing that looking at fractals, the kind of patterns we find regularly in nature ndash in a tree, a shell, a fern ndash lowers our stress levels. She also looked into the research that had been done into sense of awe ndash that feeling we have when we look at a mountain landscape or the sun setting over the sea. ldquoTherersquos a really exciting new field of the science of awe which has come out of Calornia in the last ten years. Most awe experiences do come through contact with nature. At this laboratory in Berkley Calornia, they studied the effect of awe experiences on an inflammation biomarker in the body, cytokines. They tested for these with ious positive emotions and found that it was only awe that reduced levels of cytokines to a signicant degree. Cytokines, she points out, are associated with disease, depression and ill health. ldquoThat suggested that these awe experiences werenrsquot only giving us a momentary boost of wonder, they were also having a direct influence on our health and le expectancy.A great deal of research in her book covers the importance of trees and green spaces. ldquoWhen I set out on my journey, I instinctively knew that trees are nice and having them on your road is nice in some way. But I didnrsquot expect the strength of the evidence. Studies have found having trees on the street where you live relates to lower levels of anti-depressant use.Tree cover, seeing green, has a measurable impact on public health. It affects mental health, physical health, longevity of le.But not all of us have the same opportunities to connect with green spaces. ldquoTherersquos an inequality of access to nature,\" says Jones, \"and inequality of access to quality of nature as well. People in lower socio-economic groups or from racial and ethnic minorities usually have less access to green space and parks than those who are white and affluent. In towns and cities, there are fewer parks in deprived areas, compared with affluent areas. Yet, good access to green space is something that actually has the potential to help reduce health inequality. One of the experts Jones interviewed was Professor Rich Mitchell of the Social and Public Health Sciences Unit at Glasgow University, who has pioneered the concept of equigenesis ndash the idea that certain environments can reduce the gap between the rich and the poor by weakening the link between socio-economic inequality and health inequality. His studies e have shown that people who lived near parks and woodlands had lower levels of income- related health inequalitiesSuch research suggests that it isnt just important that we rewild ourselves, but that we rewild our cities and societies. We need a wider rewilding revolution. As Jones puts it, \"It should be a human right for everybody to have access to the natural world ndash and thatrsquos something wersquore failing at as a society.\"The authors mentioned in this piece, Vicky Allan, Anna Deacon, Lucy Jones and Alice Vincent, will be speaking at events at Aye Write in Glasgow on March .Everyday ways to rewild your leTake a micro-breakAccording to Lucy Jones, you donrsquot have to go on a long hike in the wilderness to get the benefits of nature. ldquoYou can do it in a micro-break, she says. ldquoStudies have found thatwe take green micro breaks at work ndash looking at a tree, even a pot plant, or out of a window onto a garden, it helped concentration for people who are feeling mentally fatigued.Smell the earth after it has rainedThat aroma is called petrochor, and the compound, Lucy Jones says, it contains is geosmin. ldquoIf yoursquove smelt that itrsquos a beautul smell. Early studies have shown that when people smell that, it activates parts of the brain associated with relaxation and calmness.Get up early and listen to the dawn chorusStudies show that listening birdsong or other natural sounds make a dference to our mental and physical health.Walk to work, or meet friends for an amble rather than a drinkJust taking a walk to work through a tree-lined avenue or a park, can potentially have therapeutic benefit. Lucy Jones says, ldquoIrsquove found that suggesting to a friend to meet up for walks is quite a cool way of incorporating nature in. I donrsquot drink anymore, I try to meet up for walks with friends."},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-blythman-seems-march-tune-successfully-part","story":"And now lets add the Dapper Mongoose, a name Irsquoll recall only long enough to write this review.

A star in and of itself, the lamb comes with salt-baked beetroot that taste exceptionally of themselves, amber-crusted potatoes- in a sort of pommes Anna treatment, only made with duck fat rather than butter- with smoked whipped feta, and a judicious amount of black olive crumb layering on salty savouriness.

Hoolet, like many villages around here, has no gas supply, so central heating runs either by electricity or oil. The topic of electricity bills leads to much sucking in of breath, although there was one couple whose house somehow escaped the notice of the electricity board.Only when they sold up and the new owners found they werenrsquot being charged did it become clear why there had always been such a blazing array of Christmas lights in this particular garden.

Aside from the occasional draught which we could dodge by retreating to the back room, it was wonderfully toasty. This was in large part thanks to generous neighbours above and below whose central heating kept us permanently cocooned.In the country, as I quickly learned, in winter there are two main subjects of conversation: weather and warmth, but the greater of these is warmth. Hoolet, like many villages around here, has no gas supply, so central heating runs either by electricity or oil. The topic of electricity bills leads to much sucking in of breath, although there was one couple whose house somehow escaped the notice of the electricity board.Only when they sold up and the new owners found they werenrsquot being charged did it become clear why there had always been such a blazing array of Christmas lights in this particular garden.

It was subsequently signed by  governments, yet progress since then has been uneven.Inequalities between women and men continue ndash most notably in the ongoing equal pay debate, but as seen also in the under-representation of women in senior positions in business, the public sector, our parliaments and local councils.Women and girls around the world still face hardship, poverty, violence and inequality.Here in Scotland there is a lot to be proud of. We are taking action to challenge gender stereotypes in early learning and education and tackle all forms of violence against women and girls, and we have committed to developing a womenrsquos health plan. And we are leading the world through the provision of free period products in education and community settings, reaching now more than half a million people.The workplace is one of the most challenging areas where discrimination and inequality remains. Its  years since the passage of the Equal Pay Act, but the average gender pay gap for employees in Scotland is  per cent. While this is three per cent lower than the rest of the UK, and the gap has narrowed over the past decade, itrsquos clear there is more to do and we are tackling this through our Gender Pay Gap Action Plan.Our STEM strategy includes measures ndash beginning in the early years ndash to tackle inequality and stereotypes which put girls off studying subjects such as maths, engineering and the sciences. Just last month, the Deputy First Minister chaired the first meeting of a Gender Equality Taskforce in Education.The role played by women in rural industries such as farming is often downplayed or undervalued, and in response to the recommendations of our Women in Agriculture Taskforce, we are providing support and training to help women take up leadership roles and other opportunities.Of course equal pay and equality across workplaces are just part of the jigsaw. Women still assume the majority of caring responsibilities in households.Which is why our transformation of childcare provision to double the number of free hours is so vital. It is happening in combination with other efforts to improve parental employment support for those on low incomes and to encourage better practice for parental leave ndash though this area remains reserved to the UK Government.The Scottish Government has introduced legislation to improve access to forensic medical services for victims of sexual offences. And we have strengthened the law on domestic abuse, to give women better protection against all forms of abuse and controlling behaviour.Funding for frontline services to support women and children has increased to pound million in - to deliver on the Equally Safe strategy ndash reflecting the fact that until women feel safe, they will not be equal.Three years ago the First Minister established the National Advisory Council on Women and Girls, and their second report recommendations focused on how we can shape better policies for women and girls across Scotland, and how we make sure that their voices are heard. This sends the message loud and clear that equality policy is not just one personrsquos job, itrsquos everyonersquos job ndash encapsulating this yearrsquos theme of being Each for Equal.I am proud of what we are doing across all areas of government to help realise gender equality in Scotland.And it is work we should all support ndash because, as Hillary Clinton famously declared in Beijing, \"womenrsquos rights are human rights\" and womenrsquos equality is good for all of humanity.bull Shirley-Anne Somerville is Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People"},{"url":null,"title":"taylor-swift-making-ukulele-cool","story":"IT was immortalised by a music hall entertainer as he leaned against a lamppost at the corner of his street.Now the ukulele is enjoying a resurgence in popularity as stars such as Taylor Swt bring it to a modern audience far removed from the days of George Formby.Multi-Grammy award-winner Swt will pack her ukulele for a tour of European festivals this summer, including a headline slot at Glastonbury.The -year-old starrsquos fondness for the humble, four-string instrument ndash dismissed harshly in some quarters as nothing more than an irritating toy ndash is reckoned to be one of the reasons more and more people are learning to play it.ldquoTaylor Swt is a star so she has definitely influenced a lot of young people who are now playing the ukulele, and that is so pleasing, said Glasgow-based Finlay Allison, one of the pre-eminent ukulele tutors in the country.ldquoShe has shown that it is cool to play the ukulele which, undoubtedly, boosts the instrumentrsquos appeal to younger people. But itrsquos obvious that middle-age and older folk are showing greater interest than ever before as well.Alison, a key member of the Glasgow Folk-Music Workshop, led a highly successful, two-day ukulele school during Celtic Connections in January that attracted more than  players.One of the great charms of the ukulele, he says, is someone can be playing a tune on it after one lesson, eventhat person has never played any instrument before.There are fewer strings on a ukulele ndash four ndash so this simplies the learning process.ldquoWith instruments such as the French horn, oboe, violin or piano, learners have a long spell in the foothills before they can play a tune, but with the ukulele itrsquos dferent, Alison said.ldquoYou can get on to the big ridge to play much more quickly with the ukulele, and this is one of the things that inspires people of all ages to pick one up ... and a player gets instant feedback with the sweet sounds that emerge. Another good thing about the ukulele is itrsquos easy to carry around and that appeals to people. Therersquos no hassle.In the th century, the ukulele appeared in Hawaii having been adapted from a small, guitar-like instrument known as a machete that Portuguese immigrants took to the island.Four main types of ukulele are currently played ndash soprano , concert, tenor and baritone.Today in the UK there have never been so many ukulele clubs ndash more than , according to the Ukulele Society Of Great Britain, which was formed in .Its secretary, James Spencer, pointed out the huge social benefits they can bring.ldquoThere are a number of reasons for the rising popularity of ukulele clubs, but one is it gets people out of the house, said Spencer, who started playing the ukulele just over five years ago.ldquoThe clubs help create a social network and I think the more people who hear the ukulele played, the more they want to join in and play it themselves.ldquoOur club members play in clubs and nursing homes and so on, and everyone enjoys their visits.The society holds two conventions in Hertfordshire each year ndash in April and October ndash but festivals are planned in other parts of the country.In the United States, too, the ukulele is riding a new wave of popularity and already this year there has been a festival in Indiana, and a two-day gathering is taking place in Maryland this month.Blair Jackson, editor of Ukulele Magazine in the States, said: ldquoThere are ever-growing legions of folks ndash young and old ndash who have taken up the instrument more recently.ldquoThe ukulele has never been a more international instrument than it is today, with new clubs springing up all the time.ldquoThe ranks of established ones are still growing and more uke-focused events are popping up around the globe.The late George Harrison, the quiet Beatle, was a huge ukulele fan.ldquoEverybody should have and play a uke, said Harrison. ldquoItrsquos so simple to carry with you and it is one instrument you canrsquot play and not laugh ... I love them ndash the more the merrier.Harrison also gted a uke to his fellow Traveling Wilbury, American singer songwriter, the late Tom Petty, but he said he already had one. ldquoYou can never have enough ukuleles, Harrison responded.Screen icon Marilyn Monroe famously played the ukulele in the classic film Some Like It Hot alongside Tony Curtis and Jack LemonAmerican guitarist, the late Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, also enjoyed playing it while Eddie Vedder, frontman of stadium rockers Pearl Jam, stunned many in  when he won a Grammy nomination in the Best Folk Album category for his Ukulele Songs release.Another George ndash Englishman George Formby, who died in  ndash was a vaudeville entertainer who is credited with greatly increasing the ukulelersquos popularity in the s and s.The Ukulele Orchestra Of Great Britain ndash hailed by the late David Bowie as ldquowonderfully clever ndash heads off for a -date tour of the USA and Canada this month, promising audiences ldquoa funny, virtuosic, twanging, awesome, foot-stomping show.At the end of May it is due to play at The Queenrsquos Hall in Edinburgh.Its members say they are all-singing, all-strumming ukulele players with instruments bought with ldquoloose change. Their belief is that all genres of music are ldquoavailable for reinterpretation, as long as they are played on the ukulele.From Tchaikovsky to Nirvana via Queen, Otis Redding and Spaghetti Western soundtracks, the orchestra likes to offer listeners ldquoone plucking thing after another.As it says on its Facebook page: ldquoYou may never think about music in the same way once yoursquove been exposed to the ukesrsquo depraved musicology.One Scottish musician who has been distinctly unimpressed with the instrument is school music tutor Davy Lees, who works for Fe Youth Music Initiative and also broadcasts for Glasgow-based charity station, Celtic Music Radio.He prefers the guitar for teaching and performing but last month he picked up the ukulele for the first time and learned to play the folk song Freight Train after a friend threw down a challenge.ldquoIrsquom glad I did it and the ukulele I learned to play was a nice wee instrument, but Irsquom going to stick with the guitar, said Lees.However, his brief dalliance with the uke paid off as it helped him raise more than pound for Strathcarron Hospice.Prices for ukuleles start at around pound, though the worldrsquos most expensive, made by John DrsquoAngelico in , sold on eBay in  for ,.ldquoIt is safe to say that the ukulele is no longer considered uncool, said Finlay Allison. ldquoThese days it is clearly on the up and up and thatrsquos great."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Alex Salmond     the trial that could split the SNP from top to bottom","story":"Tomorrow, in Edinburghrsquos High Court, Alex Salmond, the former SNP leader and First Minister of Scotland, will go on trial accused of  criminal charges including attempted rape, sexual assault and harassment.Journalists ndash and the political world ndash have been talking of little  for months.It would, of course, be illegal to report any rumours or the identity of the claimants.

We panic because it feels like wersquore doing something, or evenwersquore not it feels like we should be.One response is to panic buy. People are setting up ldquopandemic pantries to stockpile goods. Australia has all but run out of toilet rolls to the extent that one newspaper printed several blank pages so that buyers could use them in an emergency, which seemed more like a successful PR stunt than a solution. One clip from a Tesco store in Aberdeen showed racks normally filled with hand gels and sanitisers completely empty. When the media runs these stories about panic buying it exacerbates panic buying ndash a shelf-fulfilling prophecy, you could say.In the Second World War there were few media outlets. Social media was something you scrawled on a gable end or in a close mouth, and those that existed were tightly censored, so that every setback, barely reported, was trumpeted as a new beginning. For newspapers, like any incontinent Aussie today, paper was rationed so the news was thin. Nowadays any crackpot computer jockey or scaremonger can trigger a digital snowball effect. In , when some KFC restaurants ran out of chicken in Britain, people were even phoning the police, and probably the Samaritans for all we know.Hysteria needs an audience, evenitrsquos only others staring at screens somewhere in cyberspace. Panic is a bit like laughing in an empty room ndash it makes one feel a little foolish ndash whereas battering out crazed messages on a keyboard seems almost therapeutic.Graham Greene said that writing, like composing a painting, was a kind of therapy ndash an escape from panic and fear. Ralph Waldo Emerson described panic as the terror of ignorance surrendered to the imagination, which is about as a cogent a summation as you can get. So that when experts are at odds over coronavirus, as is understandable when itrsquos such a new one, their ignorance feeds the fear and frees the dark wings of imagination. I said that.There have been panics, most of them unnecessary, since the earliest humans, from which fig leaf to wear to heart flutterings over whether that dinosaur really was a vegetarian . When the Black Death struck it would have taken weeks for the news to filter to the far reaches of the country, probably a lot slower than the disease got there.The most newsworthy, because of the society we live in, have been the panics engendered by economic jolts and crashes, like the Great Depression of  or the global financial crisis of  , although these didnrsquot affect most people.Even last week one US financial commentator was arguing that everyone should be deliberately infected with coronavirus to get it over with quickly, so that the markets would recover ... never mind the thousands or millions who perished.Predictions about the end of the world ndash and there have been thousands ndash did not evoke the level of fear this virus does, probably because so few people heard about it at the time and for each wrong one the next was taken less seriously.Nostradamus put the end of the world at July , Rasputinpinned it more precisely to August , . Jehovahrsquos Witnesses keep getting it wrong ndash  was their last shot.The recent viruses, like Sars, Ebola and Zika, didnrsquot take such hold on the imagination probably, and sadly, because they were overwhelmingly infecting other people in other countries. The HIV Aids one, properly identied in , caused a spike of unease but did not cause wholesale fear outside the gay community ndash largely widespread support and sympathy ndash because once the nation got over the you-can-catch-it-by-kissing-or-shaking-hands thing, there was a clear and avoidable cause.Nonetheless, there was a massive publicity campaign, in the way there hasnrsquot yet been for the coronavirus, featuring doom-laden voices and tumbling tombstones. Perhaps thatrsquos to come.Remember the YK problem, the millennium bug, which was going to crash all computers and programs, cause aircraft to drop from the sky, trigger famine and pestilence, unleash ICBMs from their silos and generally cause a spot of global mischief  Well, not only did it not happen, it passed with a yawn.In , a food scare in Aberdeen, supposedly by contaminated corned beef causing a typhoid outbreak, caused as panic ripple. The Medical Officer of Health, Ian MacQueen, even claimed ndash wrongly ndash through the media that the outbreak was caused by tinned meat from a stockpile the Government kept in case of nuclear war. You donrsquot see much corned beef being sold nowadays so the stigma maybe stuck.Edwina Currie did the same for eggs in , declaring that most carried salmonella . It took  years for the poultry industry to recover.In , the foot-and-mouth outbreak only stopped after over six million cows and sheep were slaughtered. Tourism dropped by around % and it took the European Court of Justice to force France to eventually restock British beef.Panics past, what of the present  Judging by the emptying shelves itrsquos on a new and higher level, out of reach of reality. By comparison, the massive death toll from flu and associated illnesses in the winter of  was more than , but I donrsquot recall similar hysteria. In Scotland, the winter death toll in   was over ,, the overwhelming causes being flu and pneumonia. Neither provoked the fear of this one.Is it justied  Too early to say. The coronavirus appears to be less deadly than Sars, which killed around % of people who became infected, as against about % so far. Because the latest outbreak is still unfolding globally, scientists donrsquot yet definitively know the virusrsquo true fatality rate.However, it has killed nearly three times as many people in eight weeks as Sars did in eight months. There are now more than , people infected across the world, with  in Scotland as The Herald on Sunday went to press.Itrsquos in our nature to worry, andthe -hour news, and fake news, media are doing a great job in playing it up. There are moments totally free from worry.

Her work has speeded up our understanding of the virus. She was a pioneer,\" said Prof Pennington.\"She was an outstanding talent ndash hall of fame, definitely. What she touched in her research turned to gold.\"Without doubt she is one of the outstanding Scottish scientists of her generation, but sadly largely forgotten. Though ironically this Covid- outbreak has shone a light again on her work.\"Her work is now helping in the fight against Covid-.\"For instance the Chinese used her technology to identy it. They repeated what she had done in looking at the culture.\"What June did is so relevant now. Her methods are still being used and it is helping in the current outbreak.\"Mrs Almeida, who died in December  aged , had far from a classic scientic path.Incredibly despite little formal education, she became a Doctor of Science and a pioneer in virus imaging, identication and diagnosis.Born at  Duntroon Street, Glasgow, to Jane Dalziel and Harry Leonard Hart, a bus driver, she left school at  to work as a histopathology technician at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.She then moved to St Bartholomews Hospital in London to continue her career.In  she married Enriques RosalioAlmeida, a Venezuelan artist. They had a daughter, Joyce.The family moved to Canada where Mrs Almeida worked at the Ontario Cancer Institute as an electronmicroscopist.Despite having few qualications, she was promoted in line with her outstanding abilities.Publications credited her for her work on identying viral structure. Her talents were recognised by A. P. Waterson, then professor of microbiology at St Thomass Hospital Medical School in London, who persuaded her toto England to work at the hospital.Mrs Almeida developed a method to better visualise viruses by using antibodies to aggregate them. She worked on hepatitis B and the cold virus.She also produced the first images of the rubella virus using immune electron microscopy.And, working with David Tyrrell, she characterised a new type of viruses now called coronaviruses. This family includes the Sars virus.\"Around  percent of common colds are thought to be caused by the coronavirus they discovered,\" said Prof Pennington.\"She discovered the virus that is parent,you like, in this family.\"Her story is remarkable ndash she left school with hardly any qualications at .\"She was feisty without being domineering and had very strong views on science. Firm views strongly held.\"I never thought being a woman held her back. She was not discriminated against in biology. She made her own way and responded vigorously to any criticism. She was usually right.\"Her first paper on coronavirus was turned down. It was not well received because it was based on electromicroscopic pictures. But eventually it was published.\"In fact she was so good she was head-hunted to come back to the UK.\"What she was good at ndash doing the technology ndash is applied today. She was a pioneer in that particularly. She also had a talent for picking the right topic to work on and not wasting time on things that could not be solved.\"June was unconventional for a scientist ndash in retirement she became an antique dealer and a yoga teacher. She was a person of many talents.\"Mrs Almeida followed Prof Waterson to the Postgraduate Medical School in London where her contributions to articles were recognised by her award of a doctorate. She finished her career at the Wellcome Institute.While working for Wellcome she was named on several patents in the field of imaging viruses.After leaving Wellcome ndash and becoming a yoga teacher ndash she was lured back but in an advisory role in the late s when she helped take novel pictures of the HIV virus.She published a World Health Organisation manual for rapid laboratory viral diagnosis in .Never has that been more needed than now."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-msp-background-checks-voted-next-week","story":"The Scottish Liberal Democrats want to bring in new rules requiring all MSPs, MPs and councillors to undergo a Protecting Vulnerable Groupscheck, in a bid to safeguard against exploitative or predatory behaviour.The move comes after Derek Mackay resigned as Finance Secretary following revelations he bombarded a -year-old boy with online messages, including calling him ldquocute.The PVG scheme currently covers those who work with children and protected adults, such as teaching or medical roles. When someone applies to join it, Disclosure Scotland carries out criminal record checks and shares the results with iniduals and organisations.LibDem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton, pictured above, has now lodged a series of amendments to the DisclosureBill to make it an offence for an elected representative to take part in regulated activities without being a member of the scheme. These activities include meeting alone with children and vulnerable adults or spending time unsupervised with young people on work experience.The amendments will be voted on at Holyroodrsquos Education Committee on Wednesday.Cole-Hamilton said his proposal was a ldquocommonsense safety move. He added: ldquoI hope that when this comes to a vote every party in the Parliament will acknowledge the importance of strengthening the protections in place and back my amendments.New rules will set out actionssomeone fails the post-election PVG check, for example potentially requiring MSPs to be chaperoned by someone in possession of a PVG when meeting children or vulnerable adults. The amendments could also see political parties require PVG checks for anyone in a position of power or influence and could spend time unsupervised with children or vulnerable adults, such as target seat candidates or office-bearers.The LibDems said a PVG costs in the region of pound, and the extra expense could be met by the elected institution. Some councils already ask members to undergo such background checks, while others require it of those who sit on children and families committees.The PVG scheme is private, and the public and media would not knowsomeone had failed a check. However, the LibDems argued they would at least know safeguards are in place.The party said the proposal would see MSPs and others undergo a PVG check straight after being elected. This would be renewed every five years, coinciding with both the provisions that exist for other types of work where and theof a typical elected term.MSPs are currently specically excluded from the provisions in the DisclosureBill.But Maree Todd, Minister for Children and Young People, previously said she was ldquomore than happy to assess whether parliamentarians fall within the category of those who should be covered by the scheme.A Scottish Government spokesperson said any proposition ldquomust command wide acceptance across the Parliament and the public. ldquoThese particular amendments have not been consulted upon nor has detailed evidence-based parliamentary scrutiny taken place. While well-intentioned, they present a number of challenges which will have very signicant constitutional implications, not least potentially allowing the removal of MSPs on the instruction of ministers. That would not be acceptable to anyone. As a result, we welcome the debate but are concerned that these specic amendments are not the solution.ldquoThe Scottish Government is, however, keen to see Parliament find an appropriate way forward on this issue in due course."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-mixed-messages-scottish-government-doctors-pension-rules","story":"Just last month health secretary Jeane Freeman wrote to then-Chancellor Sajid Javid urging him to act.ldquoIt is incumbent upon you to take the opportunity of the March Budget to fully and finally remedy the situation and allow our NHS staff to get on with delivering care without fear of the consequences, she said.What she and the Government have never said, though, is what they would like the Chancellor to do. While politicians like former East Renfrewshire MP Paul Masterton ndash a Conservative member who was a pensions lawyer before entering Parliament ndash called repeatedly for the tapered annual allowance to be scrapped, the Scottish Government has said only that a solution has to be found.One potential reason for the Scottish Governmentrsquos reticence to name the most obvious solution to a problem that is entirely of Westminsterrsquos making is that scrapping the taper would work in First Minister Nicola Sturgeonrsquos favour.Though, like all MSPs, Ms Sturgeonrsquos salary remains frozen at - levels, at pound, it is still well above the pound, threshold at which the taper kicks in, meaning the tax-free amount she can save into her pension will have reduced from pound, a year to just over pound,. As the Government contributes .% of membersrsquo salary to the Scottish Parliamentary Pension Scheme and members contribute either % or %, when pensions growth is factored in Ms Sturgeonrsquos annual contributions will far exceed that limit. She will undoubtedly be liable for annual allowance charges.Figures released by the Scottish Public Pensions Agency under Freedom of Information legislation show that two members of the parliamentary scheme paid an annual allowance charge in each of the two years after the legislation was introduced, with the scheme paying pound, and pound, on membersrsquo behalf in   and   respectively.If the taper or the annual allowance were scrapped, such charges would either be less likely or would no longer be incurred.The Scottish Government did not respond when askedthis was the reason it has not been lobbying for the change senior doctors say is required to keep them in post. It did, however, continue to frame the problem as an NHS-specic one rather than something that is affecting the public sector as a whole.ldquoA permanent solution is only within the gt of the Chancellor, a spokesperson said. ldquoWe have been consistently clear with this Chancellor and his predecessor that he must use the UK Budget on th March to offer this and that this is all the more pressing in light of the current Covid- challenge we all face."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-voices-truth-reading","story":"Recently our sister paper, The Herald, reported that a National Literary Trust Survey found ldquojust a quarter of children read for pleasure every day and that ldquoScottish pupils have the joint greatest level of reading comprehension in UK.So far, so good.However, the picture faded with the news that, ldquoon average, they are reading the least dficult books.

With one-time frontrunner Elizabeth Warren ending her campaign last Thursday, the US Democratic presidential field is now pretty much inhabited by a two-man race between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders for the partyrsquos nomination.Sure, Tulsi Gabbard the congresswoman from Hawaii and her one earned delegate remains in the race , but this is a far cry from the six Democratic women, three African Americans, a Latino, a gay man, and three Asian Americans who stepped up to contend for president earlier this year.Once again white and male seems to be the order of the day when it comes to running for Americarsquos highest office. So just why did things end up this way and what does it tell us about American politics right now as the race for the White House heats up As the New York Times reporter Lisa Lerer pointed out a few days ago, ever since Donald Trump won the presidency womenrsquos rage has fuelled the Democratic Party.In response to Trumprsquos flagrant misogynism, new political organisations sprung up, women led protests like the #MeToo movement, ran for office and voted for Democrats more than they ever had before. There was in effect a fundamental sht in the way many Americans viewed elected power and government.This yearrsquos democratic primary certainly reflected that with a record number of women vying for the chance to run for the US presidency.Of the  main Democratic candidates six were women, including four senators - Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand - along with Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman, and Marianne Williamson, a motivational speaker.It was back in , when Hillary Rodham Clinton first announced, ldquoIm in, and Im in to win, stoking hope in those Americans who valued political parity and that a woman could become the president of the United States.The talented sorority who stepped up to the challenge this year felt exactly the same way as Clinton, and between them brought together a pool of backgrounds and abilities that included former prosecutors, senators, a combat veteran and a self-help celebrity.Their rise too came off the back of the success of female Democratic candidates in the  midterms, when female voters played a critical role in electing a record-breaking number of women to Congress.On the face of it, things appeared to have come a long way and were turning out for the better. The last time Democrats selected a woman, as the vice-presidential nominee was when Geraldine Ferraro ran as Walter Mondalersquos running mate in , though they lost  of the  states to Ronald Reagan.On the Republican side, the last female vice-presidential candidate was Sarah Palin, whose presence on the ticket was believed to have hurt John McCainrsquos campaign. Some political observers insist though that the lingering legacy of such experiences remains a major hurdle for women contesting for senior office.ldquoSome of the gender dynamics is more like once bitten, twice-shy and unfortunately that dynamic tends to impact women far too often in politics, observed Lara Brown, a political scientist at George Washington University in a Financial Times interview following the withdrawal of all women candidates except for Gabbard.Those who fought that campaign though while clearly frustrated, equally insist there is no point in looking back.Elizabeth Warren who for a time was seen as the candidate to beat in the Democratic field said on Thursday that she had ldquono regrets about her campaign.ldquoTen years I was teaching a few blocks from here and talking about what was broken in America and ideas about how to fix it, and pretty much nobody wanted to hear it, Warren said speaking in her home state of Massachusetts.But just like her rival candidates Warren still feels there is much fixing to be done when it comes to making sure women are on an equal political playing field as men.Many observers agree, including David Plouffe, the political strategist best known as the campaign manager for Barack Obamarsquos successful  presidential campaign.In an interview with Politico magazine Plouffe flagged up his belief that Warren ldquowas put through a ... crucible of the electability question in a slightly dferent way than some of the other candidates were.The presidency specically now seems to be a harder ceiling, says Plouffe who contends, ldquothere is more resistance to a woman president then there is to any male minority group, or a male of any sexual orientation.Democrat Mazie Hirono a senator from Hawaii echoes Plouffe views. She insists therersquos something about a woman running for a top executive post that brings out ldquostrange attitudes in American voters.ldquoThey think women are not tough enough, that we canrsquot do the job, Hirono insists, adding that it was something she experienced when running for governor in , though a Republican woman beat her in that race.Butone thing is beyond doubt itrsquos that Warren like the other women candidates in the recent campaign are more than up to the task.Known to stay at campaign rallies for hours after they finished Warren talks of what she calls a ldquopinky promise at her events, telling young women: ldquoIrsquom running for president because thatrsquos what girls do.Another woman candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar likewise described feeling a ldquokind of obligation to the girls who would approach her at events.ldquoThis is how I reconcile some of the fact that Irsquom not up there anymore. Itrsquos that you also see women with power, she said in an interview last week.ldquoThey ended up by not choosing the women, but that doesnrsquot mean the women are going to go away, Klobuchar added.Speaking after her withdrawal from the campaign on Thursday, Warren said thatldquoone of the hardest parts of this is all those pinky-promises and all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years.There are those who will argue of course that Warren likely failed for reasons more than gender. She was after all competing with male counterpart Bernie Sanders for the progressive mantle while also arguing she could bridge the two wings of the Democratic Party better than her opponents.Askedsexism had played a role in her performance during the primary, Warren was equally candid, warning that she will have a lot more to say on the subject later. Her reluctance to spill the beans now is a measure of the potential damage she could do to the presidential hopes of her male Democrat colleagues still in the race.ldquoGender in this race, you know, that is the trap question for everyone, Warren told reporters for now.ldquoIf you say, lsquoYeah, there was sexism in this race,rsquo everyone says, lsquoWhiner.rsquo Andyou say, lsquoThere was no sexism,rsquo about a bazillion women think, lsquoWhat planet do you live on rsquoFor the second time in four years, an exceptionally qualied female candidate lost to her male counterparts, some objectively far less qualied. Warrenrsquos loss might not have been as rapid and headline grabbing as Hillary Clintonrsquos in , but the voters rejection still hurt deeply, so much so that she could only muster a third place in her home state of Massachusetts on Super Tuesday.Few doubt that those female candidates like her seemed held to a higher standard when it came to being ldquopresidential, electable and even likeable observed Swanee Hunt in a CNN op-ed article last week.For women those three characteristics ldquowar with one another, said the Hard University Kennedy School lecturer.ldquoA woman who seems nurturingpays a steep price. Gillibrand chose to take a soft approach by wearing dresses in contrast to the suitsthat many female candidates wear. Yet beyond optics, she took on issues more overtly women focused than those of her competitors, observed Hunt.Likewise in the case of Kamala Harris, was it her strong show of boldness in confronting Joe Biden on race that made her unlikable  asked Hunt.Harris after all wasnrsquot just simply a black candidate, given that Obama had already blazed that trail. ldquoShe was a black woman, Hunt opined.Biases about both gender and race likely intersected on a iety of fronts in the campaign. One example is that in a July poll of likely New Hampshire voters there were good favourability figures for both Warren and Harris.These came in at  per cent for Warren and  per cent for Harris, but were accompanied by poor ldquolikability ratings for them. Just  per cent of likely voters thought Warren was ldquolikable, and  per cent for Harris. Compared to that,  per cent of likely voters thought Biden and Sanders were likable.According to research from Tufts Universityrsquos Brian Schaffner and YouGovrsquos Sam Luks, released that same July, prejudices about women could well have translated to votersrsquo decision-making.The study found Democratic primary voters who scored higher on a ldquohostile sexism scale were less likely to choose either Warren or Harris as their top choice for the primary when polled.Many of those watching to see how far the United States had come between  and  in the degree to which gender presented a hurdle to women candidates will doubtless feel disappointed by such findings and the events of the past weeks during the Democratic campaign.Many too maintain that sexism pure and simple is one of the main reasons to blame for the disappearance of women candidates from the race for the presidency.ldquoIf Bernie Sanders were a woman, ldquoshe, as an angry, rumpled candidate, never would have made it beyond Mayor Sanders, and even that would have been a stretch, observed Jenner Burton a leading Democratic media consultant.ldquoLikewise,Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren or Amy Klobuchar were men, I have no doubt that one of them would be our nominee against Donald Trump, added Burton.But many still insist that what all this really boils down to is that candidates matter. While sexism continues to inhabit politics in America as it does in many places, one of the primary reasons say some is that the female candidates running for president did not make it to permanent frontrunner status is the spectre of Donald Trump and the  belief that many voters have that a woman cannot beat him.This and the Democratsrsquo obsession with finding the most ldquoelectable candidate to do just that, loomed over everything in the primary election watchers point out.Democratic voters they conclude ranked ldquothe ability to beat Trump as their main concern and decided that within the deeply ingrained and often invisible institutional norm, it means a woman canrsquot win.ldquoThere is perceived safety in whiteness and maleness, says Addisu Demissie, who ran Democrat Senator Cory Bookerrsquos campaign this year before he too pulled out.ldquoTherersquos a perceived risk in nominating women and people of colour that was just too great for the electorate this time. Itrsquos wrong and unfortunate and sad, but politics is about perception, Demissie told Politico magazine in a recent interview.Despite this latest setback for women candidates in the campaign, activists are quick to remind that it is only that, a setback.In the last four years, female candidates in the US political scene have made historic gains. Hillary Clinton became the first woman to win the presidential nomination for a major political party and a record number of women ran and were elected to office in Congress. These are the positive signs on which to build and good reasons for not becoming downhearted or disillusioned the same activists insist.ldquoSo today we mourn. We had six amazing women run, and now the top runners are two old white guys, observed Erin Vilardi founder and CEO of Vote Run Lead, a US national training programme for women to run for office.ldquoWe acknowledge that this is heartbreaking, and itrsquos OK to be sad.

Therefore, the decision to go with one team was made.“As I’m sure we can all understand, Shetland, who have supported us throughout, were unhappy with this decision and asked Orkney to reconsider and look at other ways to try to field a second team.“For Orkney, the cost of travel and the amount the association would have to subsidise players’ travel made sending two teams unfeasible.“Shetland voiced their concern over the cost of organising the event for only one team, and, after further discussions, the decision was finally taken that this year’s senior inter-county would not take place.“This decision has not been taken lightly, and the committee and players involved are very disappointed.“We hope the fixtures willnext year.”Shetland are in the midst of an unrelenting winning run at senior inter-county level Orkney having last won the ‘A’ fixture in .Leask said: “We tried to re-arrange it. Both counties have tried to do as much as we can.”The  inter-county will be the th anniversary of the fixtures, and both counties will be eager to ensure the occasion is celebrated.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to this report, in fact, Huawei is one of the companies that has benefitted.”Responding during the debate, Iain Duncan Smith MP said: “I think that’s shocking. I thinkthat is true it is an absolutely indictment and I do think the British Government has got to be speaking up more. It is shocking and it is time that we call it for what it is.”Summing up at the end of the debate, the minister for digital infrastructure, Matt Warman MP, said: #The UK has been vocal in drawing attention to the systematic violation of human rights of Uighur Muslims.

They asserted that it went against current council policy, which dictates that there should be no permanent increases to the current officer establishment.At the end of discussions, the council leader received more support, and councillor Stockan’s motion won,  votes to seven.However, at a general meeting of the council yesterday, Tuesday, the council leader agreed that the issue should be referred back to the policy and resources committee, following a further call by Councillor Tullock.Councillor Tullock said that he made his amendment in light of the failure of Scottish Government to provide a budget settlement to OIC, plus the concerns expressed to him by his constituents on the issue.Councillor Stockan said that he himself had received support for the establishment of the post, but he was happy to have it taken back to committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They will present information on the potential and the reality of conducting business globally.”Harvey Johnston, who is a patron of the OJA largely due to family connections with the country, will chair the event while Liam McArthur will be attending the seminar as Chairman of OJA.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Youth team Strom-West also offers a pathway for young girls to develop to senior football.Kirsty Brown, who plays for Kirkwall City, explained: “Women’s football in Orkney, over the last couple of years, has taken a massive step.“We’ve seen the development of Kirkwall City, in addition to Orkney Women’s Football Club, and the logical step now is try and come together, get as strong as we possibly can, and to get inter-county and Island Games going.“ is a massive step ahead of us. It’s not that long away, so we definitely need to work together and see what we can do.“There’s fantastic players in both sides. It’s great that we’ve got two clubs. It’s completely needed for the number of players in Orkney. Both teams are in the Highlands and Islands League this year, playing  matches each.“That’s a massive opportunity for the girls and women in Orkney to play competitively, but the association will bring these two teams together and form an even stronger squad who can play on an inter-county level.“The meeting itself is an initial AGM. We would really like to be in a position where we could form a committee, officially start the association, and move forward in the best way possible for the future of football.”Developing Orkney as a county squad and an Island Games regular will take time, effort and commitment.Like many sports, women’s football is now putting the building blocks in place for a successful Games in , but early discussions are taking place in regards to sending a side to the  Games in Guernsey.Nicola Croy, who plays her football for Orkney Women’s, said: “The  Games will be an eye-opener. There’s a lot of great teams out there, so it will show Orkney how much we need to come together as an Island Games team and prepare ourselves for our home  Games.“Once this committee is set up, we can start with developing the county and Island Games team.”Among the positions to fill will be coach of the new county side, tasked with guiding the development of the team and leading the team to success.And in a bid to expand the playing pool even further, women who may not be playing league football currently are still encouraged to attend the meeting in April.Brown added: “There is a magnitude of abilities out there in Orkney and they’re maybe not playing.“Anybody that wants to get involved in any way, come along on April . It’s a fantastic opportunity for girls and Orkney in general.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation is now missed very much. It was an independent local organisation for the people of Orkney.#Ms Taylor, along with former colleagues and supporters, feels that there is now a big void in community mental health services. They are interested in hearing thoughts, views and ideas regarding a proposed new venture called Orkney Open Door Counselling, with the eventual aim being to source funding and sponsorship for the running of a service and its premises.The closure of OACAS, which was announced shortly before Christmas, has caused a great deal of upset in the community, with several clients and former staff members sharing their concerns with The Orcadian. The service#s former chairwoman, Chloe Jowett, has said that #years of underfunding# and a history of #undervaluing# community mental health services in Orkney was behind its abrupt and unwelcome demise.All are welcome at the public meeting, due to be held at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, on Saturday, March  at pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It suggests that agreement is possible on how the newer vessels that our internal ferry services so desperately need might be funded.“Fuel and maintenance costs continue to rise steeply, while the disruption caused by the removal of MV Eynhallow from service illustrates perfectly the urgency of putting in place vessels that are fit for purpose.“The Transport Minister has acknowledged again that Orkney’s internal ferry services fall well below the minimum standards set out in the government’s own National Ferries Plan. He also insists that discussions with the Council to find a long term solution to the delivery of these leline services are ‘ongoing’.“Meantime, however, the communities in Orkney most directly affected are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of visible progress. No doubt they will be hoping that the resolution regarding the Golden Mariana’s replacement now paves the way for agreement between the council and ministers on a wider programme of vessel replacement.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But there’s also something for adults, with the Freaky Sequin Cabaret and the madness of the Old Time Sailors raucous flashmob concerts.Keeping to the sea theme, there will be two talks telling tales of the high seas — one on a canoeing trip around the UK and the other a near-death experience on the Round the World yacht race.“This year we’re trying to take events out across the islands and to introduce audiences to experiences in new venues,” said Alasdair.“So we’ll see a horn quartet in the kitchen of Noltland Castle on Westray and talks about le on the high seas in Highland Park Distillery.”The festival ends with a silent film, accompanied by a live performance of newly created music.Orkney’s midsummer St Magnus International Festival marks the start of the summer’s festivals in Scotland and each year brings large numbers to the islands, boosting the economy and revealing Orkney to the wider world.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there.

A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night.

So far, three people have died from the disease in the UK.Saturday’s match was played at Coagh Sports Centre as Coagh United Reserves beat Hanover Reserves - in the Mid Ulster Football LeagueReserve Championship.It is understood the match referee attended Antrim Area Hospital for testing following the game and was given the all-clear.Meanwhile, Hanover’s first team, which plays in MUFL Intermediate A, were beaten - at home in the league by Crewe United on Saturday.Crewe said all its senior teams have been stood down from football activities for the next two weeks.Coagh United was also informed by the MUFL its reserve side was banned from playing or training for the next fortnight.The MUFL was asked to claryHanover had also been stood down from playing for the next  days but there was no response, while the club failed to comment on Sunday.On Saturday evening, Hanover posted on its Facebook page that the player had tested positive for the virus after the game. The club continued by saying that it immediately took “all precautionary measures” and contacted Hanover players, Coagh United and the MUFL.Hanover FC’s casino night was cancelled and a deep clean of the club’s facilities was also due to be carried out.“Again, we would wish to stress that this is something that we had no prior knowledge but following the swt actions taken upon discovery we hope that this will help in ensuring all those in direct contact with the person in question remain unaffected,” the club statement concluded.On Sunday, the club shared a link to the Public Health Agency’s coronavirus advice website.A spokesperson for Coagh United said the club has attempted to contact everyone who may have been exposed to the virus but that has proven dficult after a darts competition was held in its social club on Saturday night.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus: Two more cases in Republic sees total rise to Two more cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the Republic, bringing the total number to .\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_faf-ae--bcb-edc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_faf-ae--bcb-edc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_faf-ae--bcb-edc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_faf-ae--bcb-edc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_faf-ae--bcb-edc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKThird patient dies in UK after testing positive for coronavirusA third patient has died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fb-e-b-bc-dddfef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fb-e-b-bc-dddfef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fb-e-b-bc-dddfef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fb-e-b-bc-dddfef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fb-e-b-bc-dddfef_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"WorldCoronavirus death toll in Italy soars as  million people in lockdownItaly has now registered more cases of coronavirus than any country outside China, while its death toll has risen to .\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbb-f-b-ae-cfec_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbb-f-b-ae-cfec_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbb-f-b-ae-cfec_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbb-f-b-ae-cfec_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbb-f-b-ae-cfec_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandCoronavirus: Northern Ireland football club confirms player tested positive after Saturday fixtureA Northern Ireland football club has confirmed one of its players has tested positive for coronavirus after playing a match on Saturday. ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We brought together the entire scientic team, mobilised as soon as we became aware and then got active, said Prof Duprex.Other teams are working on developing drugs, but vaccines are our game, said the scientist, who graduated from Queen#s University, Belfast, with a joint degree in biochemistry and genetics. He gained his PhD in virology and lectured for  years at the university before moving to the US.Moderna, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech company, announced yesterday that it plans to begin human trials on a potential vaccine it is developing using RNA coding.It means there is a vaccine candidate, a step forward, the vaccine research director said, but cautioned that mass doses of a vaccine likely will not be available for a year or more.Prof Duprex said Pittsburgh was chosen as one of the centres to be picked to begin work quickly because of its long history working with viruses. The university is also internationally renowned as the professional home of Jonas Salk, the creator of the polio vaccine.We have a high security containment laboratory where we are able to work with pathogens safely, he said, adding that the centre staff has worked on other high profile viruses, including SARS and MERS.The scientist explained his team first developed cells on which the virus could be grown into millions of particles. Animal-based models to carry out deep lung tests are then produced. While historically the development of vaccines was slow - sometimes taking years as in the case of polio - times have changed with a iety of dferent ways to generate them, the former Lurgan College student said.In the case of the coronavirus, the National Institutes of Healthand the Food and Drug Administration , the regulatory bodies charged with policing trials and reviewing drugs and vaccines, have indicated they will speed up the review process.But Prof Duprex noted that it takes six months for a normal flu vaccine to be developed, tested, reviewed and be available in sufficient amounts to meet demand.We have to be realistic because when you say a vaccine is in development people have to understand what that actually means. It is potentially months, a year, more than a year, probably.The university staff are actively working with other scientists across the globe and co-coordinating with the World Health Organisation .No one#s ego is more important than the public health and we need to be collaborative, Prof Duprex said. There is a sharing of data which is not typical within the world wide scientic community, but it is critical that we are good partners.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to make uk world leader in eco friendly ferries","story":"Iain Percy at Belfast Harbour  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappIain Percy at Belfast Harbour By David Young, PAMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA double Olympic gold medallist is skippering a bid to make the UK a world leader in zero-emissions passenger ferries.Sailing champion Iain Percy is combining his own know-how from designing America’s Cup racing yachts with expertise from the maritime, aerospace and F racing industries to develop what he calls a “plane underwater”.Southampton-born Percy, , has chosen Belfast – a city with a rich ship and aircraft building heritage – as the location for the eco-friendly hydrofoil technology.His consortium – which includes leading manufacturers such as Bombardier UK and universities and local councils in Northern Ireland – is currently vying for a £ million Government grant to part-fund a £ million research and development project.The green-energy ferries will use the same hydrofoil technology that has transformed America’s Cup sailing in the last decade. vw,vw,px, px\"Artemis Technologies’ America’s Cup yacht uses the same hydrofoil technology the company is using in its eco-friendly ferry design The boat will have hydrofoil “wings” under the surface of the water that are attached to the hull with vertical struts.Much like a plane taking off on a runway, the wings drive the hull up and out of the water as the vessel picks up speed.That enables the craft to travel with its entire hull, bar the wing struts, raised above the waves – thus reducing drag, and fuel costs, by a dramatic %.With signicantly less energy required to cut through the water, the ferries no longer need the power of traditional diesel engines, and can instead operate with small electric motors similar to those used in Formula E racing cars.Percy said the aim is to generate that electricity from renewable sources, thus creating a zero-emissions craft.The hydrofoils can also be retro-fitted to existing ferries to transform their energy use.Percy said: “Think of a boat sitting on top of an aeroplane is the best way to describe it.“We all know that when we are sitting on a plane and we go down the runway, eventually a combination of going faster and the wings having their flaps down, the plane eventually takes off.“It’s no dferent than that underwater, only water is a lot denser than air – , times denser – so the wings themselves are a lot smaller.” vw,vw,px, px\"Iain Percy celebrates his Olympic Games success in front of the Harbour Bridge in Sydney, Australia, in  Percy is the chief executive of Artemis Technologies, a spin-off of the America’s Cup team, Artemis Racing.He won sailing gold at the  Sydney and  Beijing Olympics – on the second occasion alongside le-long friend Andrew Simpson, who later died in a tragic sailing accident in the United States in .Artemis is leading the Belfast Maritime Consortium – a group that includes Belfast and Ards and North Down councils, Belfast Harbour, Queen’s University, Ulster University, Belfast politan College, Bombardier UK, Catalyst, Creative Composites, Energia, and the Northern Ireland Advanced Composites’ and Engineering Centre . is set to be a big year for us, check out this video to find out more about our company and our mission to help lead in the decarbonisation of the maritime industry #Decarbonisation #Maritime #Foiling #Innovation #Environment #CarbonFootprint #Sustainability #SmartCities pic szXbdfeewj— Artemis TechnologiesMarch , With Bombardier’s hi-tech wing-manufacturing plant sitting adjacent to Belfast’s expansive shipyards, Percy said the city is the perfect location for a business that combined both industries.“We are effectively a wing in the water, so we’re a perfect marriage of those two industries and Belfast is uniquely placed to really world lead in what’s going to be a new transformative technology,” he said.“This is a real transformative technology and because of that the growth can be huge.“We believe that from here in Belfast there can be a huge export-led business that can make a real dference to emissions globally.”The consortium is through to the final round of a competitive process to secure support through the Government’s new Strength In Places innovation fund.It is the only Northern Ireland bid still in the mix for a grant and the only maritime-focused project.Unlike several of the other bids, the consortium is also underpinned by a signicant financial commitment – £ million – from its commercial members.Percy, who was made an OBE in , said he hopes for a positive result when the final Strength In Places awards are announced in the coming weeks.  for further information.\"

competing in multiple Olympics and America’s Cups but slowly migrated more to the technical side of our sport,” he said.“One of the great things about the America’s Cup is not only is it a sporting challenge it’s very much a design and engineering challenge as well, so, through leading America’s Cup teams, I became more involved in the office maybe than on the water in my older age.“But that has naturally led on to a passion for zero-emissions travel.“Sailing has been zero-emissions and transporting our goods for thousands of years, so to be able toto zero-emissions maritime transportation is

Last September a bomb - described as being in the advanced state of readiness - was made safe by ammunition technical officers after it was found in the Creggan area of Londonderry.A similar attack took place two days earlier which resulted in the PSNI making safe a mortar bomb that had been left close to a police station in Strabane.Last August dissidents used a hoax device to lure police officers and soldiers to a remote rural location at Wattlebridge near the border in Co Fermanagh and then exploded the real bomb.Chief Constable Simon Byrne later laid the blame on Continuity IRA terrorists for the potentially lethal incident.The previous month dissidents tried to murder police officers during an attack in Craigavon, Co Armagh, with a device discovered on Tullygally Road.In July  the New IRA claimed responsibility for a bomb placed under a police officer#s car at Shandon Park Golf Club in east Belfast.The PSNI later released a statement which placed the blame on violent dissident republicans.The latest PSNI security bulletin has revealed there has been an increase in the number of shooting incidents, bombing incidents and paramilitary-style attacks between March  and last month.It also recorded one security-related death - the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, who was killed by a bullet fired by dissidents during rioting in the Creggan in Derry.Also in March dissidents posted five explosive devices posted to locations across the UK, including one sent to Glasgow UniversityMark Lindsay, chair of the Police Federation of Northern Ireland, said yesterday that while he would not comment on the police station threat, any attempt by dissidents to launch an attack is to be roundly condemned. We need an all-out effort by society to isolate such extremism and help the PSNI bring these people before the courts, he said. Officers are resolute in their determination to serve society and it is intolerable that in  we still have to deal with such threats to our police officers.

The force received criticism after posting on social media about the initiative, with critics saying it was wrong to focus on male achievements on a day intended to be a celebration of women. The tweet said: Preparations underway for our celebration for #IWD. This year#s theme is #EachForEqual. Female colleagues nominated male colleagues who have supported them during their career.More than  members of the public commented under the post.Following the criticism the PSNI released a statement on the public commentary around the initiative.

It is vitally important that our male colleagues play their part in empowering, supporting and being positive advocates for their female colleagues.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

We’re delighted with him and with the whole team, said John McEvoy after the game. Despite winning all of their four other league games, Derry went into the match knowing they had to avoid defeatthey wanted to reach the showpiece, given their inferior points dference to both Kildare and Down. googletag.cmd.push Our sport coverage is brought to you in association with TJ Hamilton Cookstown The first half was a tale of two marksmen as Jack Sheridan and Cormac O’Doherty dominated the scoring charts. Despite playing into the wind it was Kildare who were largely in control until the th minute when Ross Kelly was dismissed for an off-the-ball hit on Meehaul McGrath. In the second half, Sean Cassidy won his battle with Sheridan – with the added protection of sweeper McGrath – to quell the threat, but each time the Oakleafers looked to pull away, their resilient opponents came back. In fact, Sheridan thought he had booked the visitors’ place in the final with a late free, but with just seconds remaining Conor Kelly was the coolest and bravest man in Celtic Park to score the biggest point of Derry’s season so far. googletag.cmd.push DERRY: Sean Kelly, Paddy Kelly, Sean Cassidy, Darragh Cartin, Seaacuten Oacute Caiside, Brian Oacuteg McGilligan, Conor Kelly , Paul Cleary , Meehaul McGrath, Jerome McGuigan, Cormac O’Doherty , Thomas Brady, Eoghan Cassidy , Seacute McGuigan , Richie Mullan.

Maghera native Peter Donnelly was in charge of the : flight from Manchester which touched down in Belfast City Airport around midnight. The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since launching in Belfast in , Co-Founders has delivered four cohorts involving  people who formed more than  teams - over  of whom are still working together. Twenty teams have received Proof of Concept funding, and eight teams have progressed to the full-time Propel pre-accelerator programme.Co-Founders has attracted software engineers, data scientists, sales and marketing experts, medical professionals, mechanical engineers, researchers, undergraduates and PhDs as well as people who have experienced a problem in a certain industry or from everyday le and want to develop a product to solve it.Participants in the new North West programme will have the added incentive of being in the running to win one of five pound, proof of concept grants from Innovate UK, the government’s innovation agency, which will be awarded to five teams with the best developed ideas at the end of the programme.Sonya Kerr, programme manager of Co-Founders, said Catalyst was hoping to attract  to  people from Derry, Letterkenny and across the North West to sign up.“We know there is a wealth of talent in the North West and a lot of people who have great ideas or are restless to try something new, who will really benefit from meeting others with dferent skills needed to build a start-up that they wouldn’t normally have a chance to meet,” she said.“Teams on Co-Founders are willing to try something dferent, meet new people and stretch themselves. We certainly don’t expect everyone to leave their jobs immediately and create a start-up but by helping people validate their ideas and build teams, it becomes a real option for many.”For example, of the nine teams who completed Catalyst’s first Co-Founders programme, three are still together and two have received over pound, in funding to build and launch their products.While on the programme, Co-Founder teams get access to co-working space within Catalyst to allow them to grow their own networks.Applications are now open for the programme at:wearecatalyst.org programmes co-founders The deadline for applications for the North West programme is this Wednesday, March . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies. This support has helped secure almost poundm of investment and is helping companies to create , jobs, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoIn direct response to Mr Hazzardrsquos comment that our focus is solely directed at investors in Belfast, in the last five years nearly % of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast and nearly % of Invest NIrsquos offers are to companies outside of Belfast.The spokeswoman said it was solely a companyrsquos decision on where it wished to visit and locate, based on its business needs.She added: ldquoThe vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations or, in some cases, the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our headquarters in Belfast which is why the Belfast figures are high.ldquoSteering an investor to locate in any one area that does not meet their requirements would be both counterproductive and damaging to Northern Irelandrsquos investment reputation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Late RUGBY.jpg","title":"Late Lansdowne try leaves ‘Hinch in relegation spot  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH suffered heartbreak on Saturday in their battle to avoid relegation from the ultra competitive AIL Division A as their Dublin opponents stole the result at the death, despite a much-improved Ballynahinch performance.The articial surface at Aviva Stadiumrsquos back pitch was the venue and the large travelling support braved Storm Jorge to roar their men on.It looked like turning into a famous victory until powerful Leinster Academy hooker Dan Sheehan drove over in the dying moments of a hard-fought match to seal victory for the home side and avenge their seven try thumping at Ballymacarn Park in November.Brian McLaughlin had made a few changes to his starting back line with Aaron Cairns moving into scrum half and Greg Hutley earning his first AIL start at out half. Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll.

There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
