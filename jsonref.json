artwork that fetched 120000 is eaten by hungry artist","story":"Performance artist consumes masterpiece in front of crowd at Art Basel in Miami, but ‘the idea’ apparently lives onAn artwork that sold last week for $120,000 and was hailed as “a symbol of global trade” has been eaten, in what might seem a fitting end for something that was an ever-ripening banana duct-taped to a wall.The piece, titled Comedian, by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan was on show at the international gallery Perrotin at Art Basel in Miami when New York performance artist David Datuna ate it, saying he was hungry.The stunt on Saturday afforded a whole new meaning to gallery founder Emmanuel Perrotin’s comments earlier this week, when he said: “Maurizio’s work is not just about objects, but about how objects move through the world.”The idea soon lived on, with a fresh banana affixed by Perrotin minutes later.“This has been interesting,” said Miami Beach police captain Steven Feldman, who was called in to maintain order as the crowd swelled.The artwork was originally hailed by Perrotin as “a symbol of global trade, a double entendre, as well as a classic device for humour”.Cattelan – who bought the banana at a local fruit market – is known for his comic pieces, including a fully functional 18-carat gold toilet titled America, which visitors to the Guggenheim were encouraged to use. The toilet was recently stolen from an exhibition in England. In a 1999 piece, Cattelan duct-taped famed Italian gallerist Massimo De Carlo to the walls of his own gallery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54169bea301c95de0b08285804e1559e8009351e/46_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba519478c328ff379b8b353478dab2fc","title":"bloomberg new contemporaries 2019 review south london gallery vintage year","story":"South London Gallery (both sites) This year’s showcase of new, international artists working – or trying to – in the UK is full of skill, vitality and humourAnyone who wants a vision of the future should hasten to the South London Gallery for the 70th edition of Bloomberg New Contemporaries. Only fledgling artists are allowed to qualify for this annual UK showcase. This means students in their final year, recent graduates or newly enrolled postgraduates, almost all of them striving under a dead weight of debt, trying to find a place to live and work, turning up to jobs in shops and bars, making their art at night, or on Sundays, on the underground or the bus.I’ve met students whose perpetual dread was not getting from the till job at Lidl to the studio (or the garage, or the old childhood bedroom) fast enough to give birth to their ideas.Yet there is no sense of defeat in the 2019 show. It has been there in the past, in a kind of sullen or weary laboriousness, a wilful cack-handedness, or a complete surrender to the iconography of the internet. But this year’s edition of Bloomberg New Contemporaries is the most vital in a while. It is visually strong, intellectually sharp, full of skill and ability, strong on painting and photography, lacking all sorts of defects seen in recent years – the moaning and pomposity and lo-fi crud. It is also unusually humorous.The first thing you see on entering the gallery is an array of abstract canvases, monochrome and ever so slightly awry, like an awkward pastiche of old-fashioned gestural painting. A couple of works appear to have slipped down the wall, and are stealing across the floor, as if they wanted to get away from all the art world solemnity. Behind them lies an enigmatic squiggle of black paint. Alaena Turner’s installation is called Secret Action Painting, a one-liner of a title to be sure. But this is nonetheless a work of historical subtlety, and a joie de vivre that remains in the memory.Jan Agha’s painting Pompous Prick is a stinging satire that holds its own as an image. The member in question is blue, and upright, with a face like thunder and a ludicrously outsize Dalí moustache – a cathartic Ubu Roi for the #MeToo generation. And maybe he has a priapic follower in Taylor Jack Smith’s animation Dentin, in which a bald old knucklehead grinds his teeth repeatedly (to a wincing soundtrack) as if unable to use his words. Annie Mackinnon sends up eco-capitalism with a brief and gloriously abrupt film portrait of her father (who works in the field of bioersity conservation) wearing a “sustainable” grow bag filled with manure, and sounding off against the pious hypocrisies of the fashion industry – “full of shit!” And Cyrus Hung has made something new out of old footage of the German master Georg Baselitz and his admirers yarning grandiloquently on about his place in art history. Hung set the words to music and rapped them himself the result is a deft and gleeful skit on all the heavy heroism.But there are other kinds of wit on show here. Stefania Zocco has looked hard at the inner life of machines – specifically the way that computer images are formed out of digital data. Her beautiful painting Looks Like a Cloud is based on a moment of raw data in all its ephemeral striations, running like a mackerel sky across the canvas – as briefly visible, it seems, as a cloud.And for pure pictorial imagination, Gabriela Giroletti’s large canvas Around and Around is a standout. Giroletti coins an organic new form that has a nearly animal force to it, a curvaceous creature arriving out of a thicket of green paint that feels so sudden as to be something other than what it is – entirely abstract.Elsewhere there are hints of painterly influence – Philip Guston, always the painter’s painter a touch of John Currin’s archness in some of the more lurid works and traces of Celia Paul’s spectral painting in pensive family portraits.And anyone looking for the legacy of Italian arte povera will find it lingering on in some of the floor-based sculptures in this show. Katharina Fitz’s Memory Palace makes an ancient city out of modest bits of storage and packing, captivating in all its columns, cylinders and rotundas. Emily Stollery creates a miniature skyline of rooftops and rafters using the discarded moulds from which real architectural elements were formed.The political art feels more global this year. Roei Greenberg photographs a Syrian tank from the 1970s upturned in Israel’s National Park, its caterpillar tyres visible, yet camouflaged in the undergrowth of history. Justin Apperley’s images of mysterious figures in a black-and-white landscape can hardly be photographs at all, or so it seems at first sight. In fact they are shots of an off-grid punk community in the Yukon, almost unreachably remote, hidden like snow leopards in plain sight.Some of the films here are striking for their brevity and punch, particularly Louis Blue Newby’s outstandingly eerie remake of a scene from David Cronenberg’s Crash from a queer perspective. But the outstanding film work here is almost static, and intentionally so – Louiza Ntourou’s exquisitely contemplative closeup of a single leaf pictured against a glowing sky between two trees. It scarcely moves in time or space, held aloft by the breeze like a detail in a Japanese watercolour. It’s titled Once Upon a Time, a Time That Never Was and Always Is.Ntourou is Greek. The 45 artists in this exhibition come from Russia, Hong Kong, Japan, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Brazil, as well as Northallerton and Ipswich. Never forget how international is the British art scene. Nearly all are still in their early 20s and they come from dozens of art schools around the country.Of course there are callow and unfulfilled works in this show. And of course the range depends not just upon the taste of the selectors – in this case the artists Rana Begum, Ben Rivers and Sonia Boyce – but on those who appointed the panel. But what’s remarkable is just how rapidly you cease to think of these Bloomberg New Contemporaries as recent students at all, seeing them instead as independent minds producing compelling new art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b690fa8fa21cddac47b0df303b1fc0d19a0357a/0_185_5994_3597/master/5994.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9c189c0ee86d201e48409916c2ec715","title":"the big picture jonathan higbee giant of 42nd street new york","story":"Jonathan Higbee came quite late to photography. He grew up in the American south and started his career as a travel writer, but when he moved to New York he discovered that words and sentences could not do justice to the streets he lived on.In the first instance, he has suggested, photography was a cheap surrogate for therapy, a way of slowing Manhattan down and forcing himself to look and find patterns in the apparently chaotic visual scene around him. He started to get a feel for odd coincidences in that chaos – moments when the background of street furniture and high rise and billboard and graffiti and traffic seemed to communicate directly with the people passing by: stripes on shirts that matched zebra crossings legs extending from bus shelters that made a comic tableau with adverts accidents of scale and serendipity that seemed like the fleeting work of an inspired choreographer.Among his favourite pictures in his book, Coincidences: New York By Chance, is this one of a “giant” walking past a billboard on 42nd Street. To Higbee’s delight, extensive Reddit threads and Instagram conversations have been devoted to theories of how the image is made. In the best of his photographs, as here, even when you understand the visual trick, your eye holds on to the illusion.Finding these images is slow work for Higbee. While he might spot the possibilities of a backdrop quite quickly, he watches and waits for hours for the ever-shifting cast in front of it to bring its ironies to life. He says he is lucky to add two images to his portfolio of the uncanny in a month. When it works, however, Higbee feels he is collaborating with the city itself.Coincidences: New York by Chance, by Jonathan Higbee, is out now (£28, Anthology Editions)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26feac4368a3fdd1a1b9215c9e3e9af65b0d5e3f/41_551_4713_2828/master/4713.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18ad6b89438fa7cfeec3a425794b09cd","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Wildfires in New South Wales, protests in Paris and Santiago, animal rights activists in Barcelona and violence in Mexico – the best photography in news, culture and sport from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b5f51d54e6647c2d84154e7fb130c6bd22cf772/0_0_4480_2689/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6553b0537bdc40b072259cb0ebc1a979","title":"nobel winner handke avoids genocide controversy in speech","story":"Literature laureate accused of supporting Slobodan Milošević gives inaugural lectureThe controversial 2019 Nobel literature laureate, Austrian author Peter Handke, gave his inaugural lecture on Saturday night in front of the Swedish Academy and in the face of intense criticism of his selection for the honour.Handke, 77, who is perhaps best known for cowriting the film Wings of Desire, is accused of supporting the genocidal Serbian regime led by Slobodan Milošević and of denying the extent of Serbian terror and killing during the 1990s in the former Yugoslavia.Since the announcement of the prize in October, international writers and human rights campaigners have called upon academicians to change their minds. Two Nobel committee members have resigned, while others, including the former permanent secretary, the historian and writer Peter Englund, refused to attend this year.The award has been especially attacked in ethnic-Albanian majority Kosovo, which was a Serbian province until it broke away after the 1998-99 war and a place in which Serbia carried out mass atrocities.On Saturday, the Kosova government announced it will boycott the formal ceremony on Tuesday, in which Handke will receive his SEK9m (£743,000) prize money and his medal. Kosovo’s ambassador to the US, Vlora Çitaku, has already called the choice of Handke “scandalous … a preposterous and shameful decision”.Quoting at great length from his dramatic poem, Walk About the Villages, Handke gave the Stockholm dignitaries gathered in the city’s old town an elliptical and lyrical speech, avoiding direct reference to the row surrounding this year’s prize. He did finish his lecture, however, by referring to the time he had spent avoiding protesters in Norway when he was given the Henrik Ibsen award in 2014. He spoke with warmth of a moment when one of his bodyguards had shared some Norwegian love poetry with him on the screen of his mobile phone. In his speech accepting that prize, he had told his critics: “Go to hell, where you already are.”His Nobel lecture, instead, drew heavily on Slovenian-Slavic religious litanies. Handke reminisced about hearing them “beneath the romanesque arches of the church” near his birthplace village of Stara Vas in Slovenia on the Austrian border .He quoted a long rote of epithets and invocations from the Laurentian Litany to Our Lady.His long creative career, Handke said, had been given its rhythms, and even its “oomph”, not just from books, but from paintings and films. He listed the westerns of John Ford and Yasujirō Ozu’s Easterns, as well as the music of Johnny Cash, Leonard Cohen and Bob Marley.On Friday, Handke dismissed questions from journalists about his admiration of Milošević and his denial of the Srebrenica massacre, in which almost 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, saying it was not the moment to answer “ignorant” queries. He added: “This is a very long story. To tell this story here, I think it’s not the moment.”In defence of the Nobel committee’s choice of Handke, its chair, Anders Olsson, has emphasised that “the ambition is to celebrate his extraordinary literary work, not the person”. Olsson also told Mehmet Kraja, president of the Academy of Sciences and Arts in Kosovo: “It is clear that Handke is understood in different ways … When Handke is awarded the prize, the ambition is to celebrate his extraordinary literary work, not the person … We should strive to respect each other notwithstanding sharply erging views in important matters.”Nevertheless, a petition signed by almost 60,000 people calling on the Nobel committee to revoke the award from the “apologist for the ‘butcher of Balkans’, Milošević is due to be delivered by protesters at Tuesday’s ceremony in Stockholm.Also giving her Nobel lecture on Saturday, just ahead of Handke, was Polish feminist writer Olga Tokarczuk, 57, who won the 2018 medal, postponed as a result of another scandal that engulfed the jury last year.Tokarczuk’s speech did not tackle criticism of Handke head-on, but was much more forthright. Her subject was the enduring importance and power of story-telling in efforts to establish historical truth.“A thing that happens and is not told ceases to exist and perishes. This is a fact well known to not only historians, but also (and perhaps above all) to every stripe of politician and tyrant. He who has and weaves the story is in charge,” she said, going on to refer to the new difficulties literature and history face in the age of online international communications.“The internet, completely and unreflectively subject to market processes and dedicated to monopolists, controls gigantic quantities of data used not at all pansophically, for the broader access to information, but on the contrary, serving above all to program the behaviour of users, as we learned after the Cambridge Analytica affair,” she said.“Instead of hearing the harmony of the world, we have heard a cacophony of sounds, an unbearable static in which we try, in despair, to pick up on some quieter melody, even the weakest beat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/260ae7c8a0ccd94478f8ce28cb56ab6580ccc47a/0_18_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70e7d6801111aa6823732aea38321765","title":"why women love literature read fiction helen taylor","story":"The narrator of Anna Burns’s Booker prize-winning novel, Milkman, likes to read on her way to work, even as she walks. Her preference is 19th-century novels. She likes to retreat to “the safety of the scroll and papyrus of earlier centuries”.But in her claustrophobic community during Northern Ireland’s Troubles, it marks her out as a threat. Even her best friend sees her habit as “disturbing”, “deviant” and “not public-spirited”. The narrator is confused. “Are you saying it’s okay for him to go around with Semtex but not okay for me to read Jane Eyre in public?”A woman doesn’t need to have grown up amid sectarian violence to relate to the narrator’s difficulties. Even in peacetime Bristol, where I occasionally flaunt my literacy in public – usually while stationary, but not always – I often run into difficulty. A woman reading a novel in a coffee shop, or on a park bench, or on public transport always runs the risk of someone – almost always a man – sidling over and asking: “So. A reader, huh?” Or, maybe: “Have you read any… um, um… Patrick O’Brian?” Or more likely, something completely un-novel-related.It’s as if they assume I’m bored, or sad, or killing time until a man absorbs my attention. Usually, I am reading for work – so hard to explain this to the interrupter without inviting further interruption! – and yet I can’t help noticing that this never happens when I am on a laptop, when I might after all be doing something socially useful, perhaps involving a spreadsheet or a credit card. But if I am reading: who knows?There is something about the female bookworm, face obscured by a novel, hidden within plain sight, possibly pondering the bigger questions of life, possibly fantasising, that can serve as an affront. The onus has long been on women to facilitate easy human relations, and lone reading is an occupation that is not compatible with the social self.Damian Barr, author and founder of the Literary Salon in London, thinks that reading can still be a “rebellious and dangerous activity” for women. “There are men who still find it threatening and dangerous when a woman picks up a book,” he says. When he interviewed Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, for his salon, he was appalled at the abuse she had received for talking about novels. “People would say that reading fiction is not important, she should be running the country. Why is reading less valuable to a leader than, say, playing golf?” This goes some way to explaining the depth of feeling expressed by the women surveyed in a new book by Helen Taylor, Why Women Read Fiction: The Stories of Our Lives (Oxford University Press). Taylor, emeritus professor of English at the University of Exeter, surveyed more than 400 female readers to see how they relate to fiction. The responses are striking in their violence and intensity, in the sin and guilt associated with reading, as well as the defiance. One mother described how she tells her family that she is going downstairs to sort the laundry just so she can steal 10 precious minutes with a novel. Another wrote that for her, reading novels was “fractionally less important than breathing, but only just”. Others fear being caught in the act.The idea that fiction is a female domain is taken for granted by most people involved in books. According to Nielsen Book Research, women outbuy men in all categories of novel except fantasy, science fiction and horror. And when men do read fiction, they don’t tend to read fiction by women, while Taylor claims that women read and admire male novelists, rarely making value judgments.Ian McEwan once wrote: “When women stop reading, the novel will be dead.” Back in 2005, he and his son culled the library of his London house and took stacks of books to a local park to give away. He said every woman he approached asked for three, whereas every man “frowned in suspicion, or distaste” and usually said something like: “‘Nah, nah. Not for me. Thanks, mate, but no.’”The history of fiction has always been a history of women readers. From the 18th century, the novel itself was aimed at a new class of leisured women, who didn’t receive formal education in science or politics. The male writers and critics who wrote and appraised the first novels legitimised the form, but Taylor says they “were quickly overtaken by women writers of sensation and romance fiction. Women took to it as a way of learning about other lives, fantasising about their own relationships and narratives that allowed them to challenge their own subordinate position to men.”Though there have been histories of women’s reading, Taylor’s spirited, engaging study is the first that tries to capture how fiction matters to contemporary women of different ages, classes and ethnic groups. She says that when she tells men the title of her book, they get defensive. “They say, ‘But I read fiction too!’ I say, ‘I’m sure that’s true, but far fewer men do.’ When I scratch beneath the surface to find out why they have read a certain novel, they never give me an emotional answer. It’s always: ‘Well, it’s because I’m very interested in stories about the first world war or the Victorian period.’ Or they say they did history at university and want to follow up certain ideas. Or that they quite like to read Martin Amis because his characters are funny.”Louise Doughty, author of nine novels, including the bestseller Apple Tree Yard, notes that her male readers often express – or possibly dress up – their admiration for her books “as an act of anthropological research… One very sweet note from a man said, of Whatever You Love, ‘I learned more about how women feel from your novel than I did from decades of research I commissioned in my job as an advertising executive.’ The implication was he read it from a sincere desire to discover something ‘other’, rather than discovering a universal truth about human nature.”Jonathan Coe, author of The Rotters’ Club series, considers himself unusual in attracting an equal male-female readership. But he, too, feels that men and women seek different things from fiction. “I dislike generalisations, as a rule,” he tells me, “but if the male reader’s choice is more thrillers or fantasy, while women are more likely to go for ‘literary’ fiction, that suggests to me that women read books to understand themselves, and men to escape themselves.” Taylor says that it is rare to find men expressing the way in which reading has impacted on their emotional, spiritual and sexual lives. While her correspondents for the book frequently refer to how novels make them feel, their appetite for fiction is “gluttonous” and “omnivorous” one says she has a “print tooth” and another likens reading to “secret eating”.William Thackeray called fiction “sweets” – to ensure a balanced diet, he also recommended “roast”, by which he meant nonfiction. It’s surprising how enduring these puritanical associations have proved fiction is still seen as “a slippery slope to idle self-indulgence”, as Taylor has it. One of her correspondents wrote: “having an affair is dangerous, masturbation requires solitude and privacy. Reading a book offers both without anyone noticing.” Some readers are less restrained. Taylor’s book includes Pierre-Antoine Baudoin’s 1760 painting, La Lecture (The Reader), which depicts a young woman apparently masturbating with one hand while stroking the pages of a novel with the other.And while for many, reading is an intensely personal activity – “a lifeline”, “my best friend”, “the love of my life” – it is also an activity that women share with other women. The contemporary book group can trace a lineage back to 17th-century Bible study groups, 18th-century Parisian salons, as well as progressive suffrage groups where women have gathered together to self-educate. The sharing of reading is “something women undoubtedly do automatically in ways that are inter-generational, gregarious and collegiate,” says Taylor.I’m currently on at least four active WhatsApp threads about fiction with people who have no connection to the publishing world. There’s my local book group of school mums exchanging messages about Madeline Miller’s novel, Circe my mum (a retired teacher) sending me pages from the Edith Wharton she’s reading a friend who has been weeping over Colson Whitehead’s latest and several about Elizabeth Strout’s book, Olive Kitteridge, which I bought for two of my best friends. We send each other lines from the book that most resonate, and we have all recommended it to our mothers – and so the chain of bookish messages proliferates.Sharmaine Lovegrove, publisher of Dialogue Books, recognises that women’s book groups often act as “gatekeepers of our culture”. She made a conscious effort to start a different sort of reading club: she launched a year-long literature course, Rewriting the Canon, held at Liberty department store in London, with the aim of expanding the western canon to include more writers of colour. In collaboration with gal-dem magazine, she drew up a list that included Passing by Nella Larsen, Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin and Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston. It ended up looking very different from “women sitting around drinking wine in Wiltshire or Richmond”.It’s striking how many women in Taylor’s book talk about fiction giving them social mobility. A lot of her correspondents described themselves as having come from working-class or poor backgrounds where there were no books in their house, but through libraries, schools, friends and extended family, they had pulled themselves up. Being accepted as a good reader has long been one of the ways for women to achieve greater social status, Taylor says.Meanwhile, there are many female authors who understandably feel ambivalent about whether to embrace this bond with their female readership. Roxane Gay once noted that: “Male writers get treated as intellectuals, women writers get treated as friends.” Will their writing be dismissed as “domestic saga” or “chick lit”? Will it be a sure route to pastel-coloured book jackets?Responding to a comment by Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgård that “reading is feminine”, novelist and essayist Siri Hustvedt took issue with the idea that the activity should somehow be “tainted” for being associated with women. It elides a historical double standard: literature is sidelined as a fey, womanly business but for centuries only a privileged class of boys were taught literacy skills. Asked what she thought posed the biggest threat to literature, Hustvedt said: “That it becomes, in the eyes of culture, a highly feminised form. Far more women read fiction than men, and because of this, novels have become marginalised as serious texts.”It’s a prime concern to Mosse as founder of the Women’s prize for fiction. “Implicit in that is the idea that men’s opinions matter more that if something is predominantly considered a female activity, then it is not as valuable and important.” And even if women are speaking to other women, why would that be any less meaningful than men speaking to other men? “Women artists must be allowed to focus on their own achievements, their own writing, their own voices without always being asked to consider the external response to it.”Hilary Mantel spoke to Taylor about her fear of being “Little Womaned” – boxed as an author who is incapable of writing about the “wider society” because she “cannot pull away from personal preoccupations” about what women want.“It’s not surprising that Hilary Mantel wanted to get entirely away from a female world with her Tudor series because she wanted recognition,” Taylor says. “But at the same time: what could be better as a writer than to feel you are speaking directly to women who see you as a friend? Why would any author object to that? You can say it’s fluffy, but actually it’s real and rather magical. Let’s speak up for the fact we read fiction because we want to explore our feelings. We cry at the end of a romantic novel because we are both moved by someone else’s plight but also because it’s stirring up bittersweet things in us.”Emotional intelligence is something of which women are rightly proud. A woman will often be called upon to play the family peacemaker, to ease social relations, to mediate friendships. She might find in Emma Woodhouse or Dorothea Brooke, say, instructive examples. Taylor feels this needs to be celebrated along with the ways in which women share the fiction that warms, comforts and sustains them. I ask Coe whether he sees marked differences in the way men and women respond to his novels. “Female readers in the signing queue will sometimes tell you directly how much a book has moved them, whereas male readers will say how much they share my enthusiasm for obscure bands like Hatfield and the North,” he says. “But I think, essentially, they are saying the same thing: it’s just that men sometimes need these proxies, these intermediaries – football, music, etc – as a way of voicing their emotions.”Taylor says she “always warms to men who read novels” and I agree – we both married our husbands partly because they were keen readers of fiction. It’s no coincidence, I’m sure, that the most emotionally intelligent men I know regularly read and enthuse about women writers. “I love that they’re not reading just to get facts,” Taylor says. “I think they’re reading fiction to try and understand the world from an oblique perspective. Fiction takes you on indirect routes to truth.”Why Women Read Fiction: The Stories of Our Lives by Helen Taylor is published by Oxford University Press (£14.99). It will be Radio 4’s Book of the Week starting 13 JanuaryI’m reading a series of children’s books about refugees, by Alan Gratz. I’m interested in refugees, so I’m reading around the subject and finding it fascinating. Fiction is the best way into history and into humanity. I’m from Dublin originally and if anyone is interested in the history of Ireland I urge them to read Dubliners by Joyce first – and then look at the history.There’s definitely a difference between what men and women read. In my teaching career, I saw boys who were reluctant readers get completely into reading if you find the right genre. It was all about genre for them.I’m trying to get into reading more fiction, because I wasn’t into it for a while but I think it helps your brain. It expands you in a different way. My husband just reads dry academic stuff – forget it, I am not going there.Women like to read about love and romance – it feels like a way of settling your mind, taking away today’s mental stress. Just fix it yourself, rather than reading the news all the times, because the news is really depressing.Interviews by Holly Williams"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57adf348d75a019e19210a0664705b03375c9bb7/835_19_2619_1572/master/2619.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5303d047b079ee8c91a28ab8090d45d","title":"observer view on general election and who to vote for","story":"This is a historic election, the most important choice voters have faced in decades.

It will influence the type of society we are: whether the number of children who grow up in abject poverty and the number of people sleeping rough – stains on our collective conscience– will continue to rise. It will decide the sustainability of the world we bequeath to our children and grandchildren.Yet there is no disguising that this is an election of last resort, the product of an unedifying journey through months of parliamentary gridlock.

A vote for Johnson is a vote for its vision of Britain: a low-tax, low-regulation state in which worker and consumer rights are sacrificed in the name of corporate profit.At the heart of Johnson’s appeal is the myth that a vote for the Conservatives is a vote to “get Brexit done”, as if our exit would not be followed by long and tortuous negotiations about the final relationship. But the worst of it lies in the casual indifference a prime minister has shown to a peace process that ended decades of bloody conflict in Northern Ireland. The Stormont assembly chamber has sat vacant for years, putting the principle of governing by cross-community consent in grave jeopardy. That Johnson would endanger it further by imposing a customs border on Northern Ireland in order to enhance his re-election prospects is reprehensible.Reprehensible, but perhaps unsurprising, given his record. Long happy to deploy racist stereotypes and dogwhistles when he has judged them to benefit his career, he shrugs them off under questioning as irrelevant relics from the past. His hypocrisy is breathtaking: compare his vile comments on single mothers with his evasiveness about whether he takes parental responsibility for the child he fathered while married to someone else. His rank incompetence at the Foreign Office has had tragic consequences for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who languishes in an Iranian jail.Johnson has defined his campaign by running against the record of a government of which he was part a government that delivered billions in tax cuts for more affluent families while cutting tax credits to support children living in poverty that starved schools and hospitals of the resources they needed, with little thought for the young and the seriously ill. The Tory manifesto stops far short of reversing the cuts of the last decade, despite what Johnson would have us believe: he lied about the number of extra hospitals a Conservative government would fund and misled voters about the number of extra nurses it would train.The Conservatives have also fabricated figures about the cost of Labour’s policies. While Labour has also put out misleading numbers, it was joining a race to the bottom initiated by the Conservatives. Johnson has thought nothing of refusing to subject himself to the scrutiny of set-piece interviews the other leaders have faced. But perhaps the lowest moment of the campaign was Johnson’s disgraceful politicisation of a terrorist attack, deliberately deploying inaccuracies in order to blame Labour.This is the sort of campaign we could expect from a man who has gone to such lengths to evade democratic scrutiny. He has cancelled numerous appearances before parliament’s liaison committee and unlawfully tried to shut down parliament. MPs had to force Johnson to comply with the will of parliament by passing the Benn act. The Conservative manifesto threatens to strengthen the executive in relation to parliament and the courts, risking fresh disruption to our constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty.Despite a poor campaign centred around a widely unpopular pledge to revoke article 50 without a second referendum, the Liberal Democrats have started the painful process of recovery from their disastrous spell in coalition government. They have strong policies in particular on the critical issue of the climate crisis. But our first-past-the-post electoral system is unforgiving. In our two-party democracy, ejecting Johnson from Downing Street almost certainly means Jeremy Corbyn will become prime minister.But Labour’s gravest failing lies in the way Corbyn has handled the antisemitism crisis in his own party. Over three years, evidence has mounted of the institutional antisemitism, as defined by the Macpherson inquiry, that afflicts the party from the top down. The Jewish Labour Movement’s leaked submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) includes sworn statements from more than 70 former staff members and details a series of horrifying allegations, including interference in the disciplinary process by Corbyn’s office. Corbyn himself has questioned the removal of an antisemitic mural and Jewish MPs have been bullied out of the party. During this campaign, Corbyn has made assertions about Labour’s processes that leaked documents appear to contradict. Corbyn has displayed a staggering lack of contrition or empathy.Labour is, of course, not the only party to face the charge of institutional racism. There has been far less scrutiny of the misleading statements from Johnson and his ministers that the Conservative party takes a “zero tolerance” approach to Islamophobia. On the contrary, four ministers have gone campaigning with candidates facing accusations of Islamophobia. Conservative councillors suspended for posting Islamophobic content have been quietly reinstated, sometimes days later. Nearly half of Conservative members say they do not want a Muslim prime minister. The EHRC is in the process of assessing whether to launch an official investigation into the party on the basis of the available evidence. The Conservative government’s track record of racist policies speaks for itself, from the shocking deportation of members of the Windrush generation, who had lived legally in Britain for decades, to its “right to rent” policy that was ruled racially discriminatory by the high court.It is disgraceful that more than 40 years after the Race Relations Act, both main parties are stained by charges of institutional racism. Many of our readers will be grappling with their consciences about voting for Labour. This is a sign that they take racism seriously, not that they care little about child poverty and homelessness.Our political honour code is breaking down. This post-truth election is a taster of what could be to come Johnson would take us further into the abyss. That is why he has succeeded in achieving the extraordinary: uniting a former Conservative prime minister, John Major, with his Labour successor, Tony Blair, in a call to voters to turf him out.On Thursday voters have the chance to strip power from a dangerous charlatan. We abhor Corbyn’s failures on antisemitism we recall Lib Dem complicity in the dreadful policies of the coalition government we are no allies of the cause of Scottish and Welsh independence. But we urge our readers to exercise their judgment and, as their conscience allows, vote for the pro-referendum, progressive candidate most likely to deny Johnson the opportunity to wreak existential damage on our country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa7a68f9028e7288efebc78083c884778ac2fad6/0_149_5126_3075/master/5126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a353ad87ae2e53427ff192cab38d5b","title":"we young voters grew up with austerity now we want change","story":"My generation’s coming of age has coincided with coalition and Conservative governments. Austerity, which has shaped our formative years (I’m now 22), was framed as a fiscal necessity. But the severe cuts to government spending made an impact on healthcare, youth services, education and many other public services. These aren’t just abstract spending cuts – they are viscerally felt on the ground. In Camden, the London borough where I attended school, the council’s budget has been reduced by £169m since 2010. It was highly noticeable while growing up.This election comes at a pivotal time and offers a chance to alter this trajectory. With engagement among young people increasing, a politics that addresses our material circumstances couldn’t be more pressing. The sense of dissonance between the priorities of the Conservative leadership and younger generations is glaring, both in terms of policy positions and values. The Tory manifesto mentions the climate crisis only 10 times, compared with 60 times for Brexit. The Windrush scandal, and the continuing fight for justice, serves as a reminder of how Conservative immigration policies have cultivated an atmosphere of fear among immigrant communities. The hardline immigration policies of the home secretary, Priti Patel, coupled with Boris Johnson’s assertion that he is in favour of having “people of talent” come into this country as long as it is “democratically controlled” reinforces the dichotomy of the “good” and “bad” immigrant.The material effects of coalition policies, combined with a worldview that doesn’t fit with ideas of tolerance and inclusivity, have resulted in an urgency for change.The idea of a cult of personality surrounding Corbyn may have made sense during the 2017 election coverage, but there now appears to be a shift among young people. Labour’s inability to comprehensively address its problems with structural racism, especially antisemitism, is damning. And this has not been ignored by young Labour campaigners. Among young party volunteers campaigning in Putney, south-west London, one, despite being a member of Momentum, mentioned that there was a “tacit agreement not to mention Corbyn on the doorstep”.If we’re still on board with Labour, it’s because of innovative and transformative ideas that have brought vibrancy and intellectual curiosity to a young electorate. Labour’s commitment to a green industrial revolution makes concrete steps to address the climate crisis. Labour’s current position on immigration reflects the values that many young people like me share – that freedom of movement isn’t a necessary evil, as it was portrayed during the Brexit referendum, but, rather, a part of a tolerant and inclusive society.Although the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that the Labour manifesto is failing to offer a “properly credible prospectus”, what is deemed properly credible doesn’t convince when we are faced with the continuation of the status quo.Young people are driven by a need to change the policies and values espoused by the government, a tangible change that will address the material inequalities between generations, as well as a moral shift. Pledges such as free hospital parking for a select few workers and in-patients won’t begin to shift the deep-rooted inequities.Johnson’s use of vulgar andoffensive language, including referring to Muslim women as “letterboxes” and the children of working mothers as “unloved and undisciplined”, fails to represent the moral values we want our society to embody.But longing for a deep political change should not be equated with an unequivocal and blind endorsement of Corbyn. Instead, it’s about the ideas behind a compelling alternative we’ve been offered, in contrast to a society we feel we haven’t always had a stake in.Tobi Thomas is a journalist who received the Scott Trust bursary in 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4854eabf8be9787971efe64ea4228b89815272e8/0_193_5232_3140/master/5232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efba20842861e32d04c8de02f5a01e0d","title":"tell us about your run down school buildings","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about school buildings that are no longer fit for purpose.

Mine came last summer, when a respected scientist told me matter-of-factly that he thought it was “at least highly unlikely” that his teenage children would survive beyond late middle age. At that point, three decades of climate unease crystallised into debilitating dread, and I’m far from alone.“There are hundreds of people contacting us, looking for support,” says Caroline Hickman of the Climate Psychology Alliance. It’s not just iniduals either. “We’ve reached a level where organisations are asking for professional help to support their staff: civil servants, museums, universities… They’re noticing massive increases in anxiety and concern.”Eco anxiety isn’t pathological: it’s a legitimate reaction to the climate crisis. “It’s mentally healthy to feel this way,” says Hickman. “It’s a sign of empathy.” The real problem is how we manage our feelings.“You look at these horrific headlines about habitats and mass extinctions,” says Emma Mitchell, author of The Wild Remedy: How Nature Mends Us. “People say, ‘What can we do, we feel completely powerless?’ My answer is: we can do a great deal.”If you have outside space, follow gardener and author Kate Bradbury’s advice and plant native. “Native plants have specific relationships with native moths, which lay their eggs on the leaves,” she says. “Birds then feed the caterpillars to their young, and hedgehogs, frogs, mice, wasps… pretty much everything eats caterpillars. So by planting native shrubs and trees you’re creating a food chain in your garden and, literally, preventing further decline of species.”Avoid peat-based compost: peat stores vast amounts of carbon and peat bogs are precious habitats for wildlife.The climate crisis is happening to all of us and experts agree the most effective responses to it are collective. Acting together helps us feel less powerless, but there are also real benefits to expressing our anxiety, anger or grief with others.“Many people report that actually finding that they are not alone in this thinking, talking to other people about it, finding like-minded communities, is really powerful,” says Dr Emma Lawrance, a fellow at Imperial College London’s Institute of Global Health Innovation. In the US, the Good Grief Network hosts climate anxiety groups based loosely on the AA model, with a 10-step programme, from “Accept the severity of the predicament” to “Reinvest in meaningful effort.”Despite overwhelming evidence, truly terrifying institutional denial of the climate crisis continues. The Trump administration has blocked a congressional testimony warning about climate change, suppressed peer-reviewed government-funded studies on its effects, and fired a scientist who refused to alter reports to downplay its human causes. Worse, the administration likes to have its climate cake and eat it, denying the science while simultaneously pointing to the advanced state of ecological devastation as justification for not blocking fossil-fuel projects, whose incremental impact, they argue, would be negligible.We need clothes, but the fashion industry is regularly rated as one of the world’s worst polluters, with textiles producing an estimated 1.2bn tonnes of greenhouse gases per year. “Solving the problems of fast fashion can often feel like that puzzle where you’re trying to get a fox, a chicken and a bag of grain across the river. Just when you think you have an answer (Cotton! Clothes rental! H\u0026ampM!), someone pops up to tell you it’s problematic,” says Lauren Bravo, whose book, How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, is published soon. It’s a funny, achievable guide to reducing our fabric footprint, and covers swapping, mending, washing less and, most importantly, resisting the urge to shop.Does brilliant, furious Greta Thunberg make you feel uncomfortable? She should. She should be making TikToks or something, not crossing oceans to shout at the UN, or becoming a beacon of misplaced “hope” for a generation too feeble to acknowledge its catastrophic failures. No wonder she makes a certain type of middle-aged person incandescently angry and many of the rest of us profoundly guilty.“Is there any good news?” I text my father, sorrowfully. An ecologist who predicted a “perfect storm” of food, water and energy shortage within our lifetime 10 years ago, he’s not inclined to boundless optimism. Nostra-dad-mus flagged the UN-REDD programme, which is making real progress in fighting deforestation worldwide. Ethiopia, too, planted 350m trees in one day in July this year. And a new ocean clean-up device has shown promise in collecting plastic in the Pacific.If that’s not cheering enough, how about “le blob”, the self-healing, problem-solving, 720-sexed organism no one understands? New bioersity! I for one welcome our new yellow overlord.The onslaught of information on extreme weather events, dire research findings and ecological catastrophes fuels our sense of panic and powerlessness, every forest fire or starving polar bear is a jolt of stress. “Obviously people want and need to be informed and understand the facts, and it’s normal to feel strong emotions in response to those facts,” says Dr Emma Lawrance of Imperial College. “But it’s important when people are finding it too much that they feel like they are able to step back and take breaks.”Decide how and when to engage with climate-crisis information and seek out good environmental news: it is out there.The funeral that Iceland held for the Okjokull glacier this summer, after it was lost to climate change, was a pure expression of “solastalgia”, a term coined by philosopher Glenn Albrecht and defined as “The pain or sickness caused by the loss of, or inability to derive solace from, the present state of one’s home environment.” In parts of the world where the impact of climate change is physically unavoidable, loss and grief are the dominant emotions: we’re lucky we’re just anxious.Ooh, tricky. Dairy is bad, but plant milks frequently mean destructive monocultures. Even oat milk, the current great off-white saviour, comes in hard-to-recycle Tetra Paks. Maybe just moisten your muesli with your own tears?For many more, it’s a fraught question. On its website, BirthStrikecollects testimony from those struggling with the issue: “Over the past 10 years or so, all the accumulated knowledge around climate change and global warming has made me increasingly nervous to have children,” says one.For eco-anxious parents, it’s another source of guilt and worry: have we ruined the planet by having kids, or our kids by having them at such an awful time?We’ve mistreated the ocean for decades and now it’s coming for us: recent research has indicated that 300 million people (rather than the previous estimate of 80 million) are at risk from rising sea levels. The IPCC has also predicted that extreme events linked to sea level will be annual by 2050. Then there’s acidification, plastics and bleaching of corals. How anyone still finds ocean sounds relaxing is beyond me: you might as well meditate to revving chainsaws.That feeling of helplessness is a common response to catastrophic ecological news. I often stand in the supermarket overwhelmed: is all fish terrible? How about bananas? It feels as if there are no simple decisions now, but according to Imperial College’s Grantham Institute, there are a few, actually. The Institute (which is working towards “a sustainable, resilient, zero-carbon future”) has published a list of 9 Things You Can Do About Climate Change. They are things “absolutely everybody can do that can make a difference,” according to Institute co-director Martin Siegert. Some are covered here (eat less meat, preserve green spaces, avoid flying) others – invest your money wisely, use your voice – aren’t. “They are relatively small steps,” says Siegert. “If anything, they’re going to improve your life.”Can we finally stop eating Satan’s cereal? Llamas are great and we need some good news.“Building resilience is essential to address the physical and mental health impacts of climate change,” said the American Psychological Association in 2017.But how? Experts agree on broad strategies: acknowledge your feelings, take action in ways that feel meaningful, be part of a community and occasionally run around screaming until you’re hoarse (OK, not the last bit).It’s terrible, but guess what? It’s also complicated. An Environment Agency report concluded you’d have to use your cotton tote 131 times to take its global warming potential below that of a plastic bag. Or what about cucumbers? 2011 research for the Journal of Food Science and Technology indicated plastic wrapping increases shelf life by six days, so what’s more important: avoiding waste or eliminating plastic?The UK Committee on Climate Change’s 2019 report on progress makes for dismal reading. The Government has implemented only one of the committee’s 25 recommendations from 2018 and runs its climate crisis preparations “like Dad’s Army”, according to committee chairman Lord Deben. The “net zero” law promises to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and the fracking ban looks like good news (if it doesn’t turn out to be a short-lived election stunt), but the CCC’s prediction is that 2025 and 2030 targets will be missed by an even bigger margin than last year’s.Greta said it: our house is on fire. But, of course, right now, your actual house isn’t. It’s quite chilly in mine and there’s a blue tit pecking a fat ball outside. That’s part of the problem: we – at least in the north – can ignore the climate crisis much of the time, which makes the eco-anxious feel like those chaps who march around wearing sandwich boards saying the end is nigh.Plant-based eating isn’t an environmental panacea, either. As the head of the Food Climate Research Network, Dr Tara Garnett, brilliantly summarised in a recent article for Brain Food magazine, recent concerns about intensive monocultures and highly processed vegan foods have led some eco-thinkers to conclude that “Veganism is the vacuous entitled daughter of Big Food and Agribiz… Vegans are the problem.”Should we be eating grass-fed beef and dumping facon and not-dogs? It’s complicated, and many UK farmers are thoughtful stewards of native habitats and feel unfairly demonised. But eating fewer animal products is almost certainly a good thing.They’re not strictly a climate issue, but wipes are unequivocally terrible, changing the shape of rivers and threatening marine wildlife. We use an energy-gobbling 11bn a year, but they’re easy to avoid. Let’s just not, eh?Extinction Rebellion has only existed since October 2018, but swiftly shook off its “uncooperative crusties” reputation, with a series of high-profile protests showcasing its transformation into a global campaigning force.October’s UK fortnight of protest had moments of controversy (the Canning Town tube protest was widely considered a misstep), but it also showed that XR now attracts mass support, including from unexpected places: 77-year-old Rabbi Jeffrey Newman and 91-year-old John Lymes were arrested, and there are XR doctors, lawyers and farmers. Of course, that makes climate worriers who haven’t become climate warriors feel even more guilty: why aren’t we getting involved? Is it hypocritical to complain about government inaction from the comfort of our own homes? Almost certainly.For Jake Woodier of the UK Student Climate Network, the energy young people pour into activism is a product of the fear and anxiety they live with, from both the increasingly dire warnings in the media and from witnessing, “The destructive effects and consequences of climate breakdown suffered by their peers around the world.” Taking action is an important outlet. “I think that a lot of young people feel that they’re suffering it alone,” says Woodier. “Organising with a group and a movement gives quite a comforting sense, in a way.”For the rest of us, it’s a case of trying to understand what young people are going through and supporting them: and that means no muttering about not turning the lights out. We left the planetary lights on for decades we’re in no position to lecture them.Zero waste is a seductive idea, but unsustainable unless you’re an off-grid gardener-slash-engineer happy brushing your teeth with a twig. Limiting your food waste, however, is eminently achievable. Food and science writer Ann Storr turned her decades-long eco anxiety into an excellent, practical food waste blog, the Storr Cupboard.“Half of all the UK’s food waste happens in the home,” says Storr. (That’s 7.1m tonnes a year, according to waste campaigners Wrap.) “Meal planning is the best way to reduce your waste: 10 minutes spent meal planning so that you know what to buy and when to eat it will save you money and reduce your food waste.”It’s a small gesture they all are. And that’s OK, I think: for most of us, small change is all we have. “These most dire future scenarios are not set in stone,” Emma Lawrance reminds me. “That means that even as the climate changes, at every step we can be looking at what world we want to create from that point. There’s never a moment it’s OK to give up there are always steps to take towards the better trajectory.”We can’t save the world as iniduals, but we can make it a tiny bit better and perhaps save our sanity in the process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f7948745b809942321e61cde44459effc3b785d/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba34d499a68238b2864613d477ac2bda 660w","title":"the edit womens gifts under 50","story":"Whether you’re treating yourself or someone special, we’ve got you covered with a selection of subtle and elegant gifts that won’t break the bank "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92380738f1fa8158711f83d6bfd9890e35f38d90/0_0_5585_3351/master/5585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d3578a2d91f8f61e5e6d7ec6debe6f7","title":"christmas dinner starter vegan recipe kimchi tofu gyoza dumplings meera sodha","story":"Not conventional, but definitely fun to make and to eat, these gyoza-style dumplings make a terrific festive curtain-raiserThe truth about Christmas past is that the vegan was often sent to the Siberian end of the dining table with a nut roast for one.

Christmas, after all, is about sharing – well, until it comes to the last dumpling, at least.Don’t worry about your pleating skills: you can just press these little dumplings shut and they’ll still look lovely. You’ll need a food processor to make the filling, though.You can find gyoza wrappers in the freezer section of most Chinese shops or big supermarkets – I use Happy Belly gyoza skins, which are round and 10cm in diameter. If you can find only square ones, they’ll work, too.For the dipping sauce2 tbsp soy sauce2 tbsp rice-wine vinegar1 tbsp white-wine vinegar1cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely gratedFor the dumplings280g firm tofu, drained250g good-quality vegan kimchi 1 tbsp rapeseed oil 10 spring onions, finely chopped Salt30 gyoza (or wonton) wrappers, defrosted Black sesame seeds, to serveFirst, make up the dipping sauce by mixing all the ingredients in a small bowl, then put to one side.Cut the tofu into large pieces, then put in a food processor. Weigh out the kimchi – both cabbage and juice – add to the tofu, then blitz until the mixture resembles mince.Over a medium flame, heat the oil in a nonstick frying pan for which you have a lid. Once hot, add all but a small handful of the spring onions. Stir-fry for four to five minutes, until soft, then add the kimchi and tofu mixture and cook for 10 minutes, until the water disappears. Taste – you may need to add up to a teaspoon of salt, but this will depend on your kimchi, so add it bit by bit. Tip the mixture into a bowl, and wipe out the frying pan.For the dumplings, fill a small bowl with water. Take one wonton wrapper (cover the rest with a damp tea towel to stop them drying out). Wet the outside of the wrapper with a (clean) finger dipped in the water bowl. Put two heaped teaspoons of filling in the centre of the wrapper (or enough to be generous, but not so much that you can’t handle the dumpling). Fold over the wrapper to enclose the filling, then press closed or pinch and pleat the wrapper, working from one side to the other, pressing out as much air as possible as you go. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling (congratulating yourself on the improvement of your pleating skills as time goes on).To cook the dumplings, heat a tablespoon of oil in the frying pan over a low flame. Once it’s hot, add as many dumplings as will fit in a single layer on the base of the pan and fry for a minute or two, until their bottoms are golden. Gently flip over, turn down the heat, add five tablespoons of water and cover the pan with a lid. Steam for six to seven minutes, until the pastry is soft and the water has evaporated. Repeat with the remaining dumplings.Throw the reserved spring onions into the dipping sauce, then arrange the dumplings on plates, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve with saucers of dipping sauce."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f265ce774912a03d4b4a95dbda28323bdb63c754/94_232_1400_839/master/1400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=119d212dc92046a544e18be8b0d15a70","title":"party favourites wines for election night","story":"With the general election coming up, these three wines offer something special to make sure everyone is a winnerCave de St Verny Puy de Dôme Pinot Noir, France 2018 (£9.50, thewinesociety) There may be no Cuvee Clement Atlee available for Labour voters. But any fully automated luxury communist fully committed to the luxury part of their creed may want to seek out and share an old bottle of Piedmontese producer Bartolo Mascarello’s No Barrique No Berlusconi. These are collector’s items now, but the original bottles, made, by the late Bartolo Mascarello, as a protest against the floridly devious, buffoonish right-wing ex-Italian PM will surely strike a chord for this election. If that’s impossible to find, you could seek out one of the hauntingly elegant, traditional-style wines made by Bartolo’s daughter, Maria-Teresa, such as the Bartolo Mascarello Barbera d’Alba 2016 (£65, handford.net). The Bartolo wines are not exactly priced for the many, but Cave de St Verny’s pinot from The Wine Society ticks a lot of Labour boxes: it’s a gorgeously vibrant red that is both made and sold by co-operatives.Ciello Catarratto Baglio Bianco, Sicily, Italy 2018 (from £14.75, shop.vinoteca forestwines) The SNP has spent much of this election talking about their desire for Scotland to stay in Europe.

Also trying to present a cosmopolitan pro-European but fiscally responsible image, the Lib Dems could go for any EU-made wine – but ideally something with a touch of austerity like Morrisons The Best Petit Chablis 2017 (£11), a lean, crisp classic chardonnay from northern Burgundy. Or, if they want to push the button on something explosively tasty and more literally metaphorical, the orange bookers could go for an orange wine such as Ciello’s with its Cox’s apple, mandarin and subtle spice – a wine that, thanks to its organic credentials, should also appeal to Greens.Follow David on Twitter @Daveydaibach This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

For the second successive year Jürgen Klopp’s side will sit top of the tree at Christmas after chewing up and spitting out another innocent opponent to move 11 points clear at the Premier League summit. After being overthrown by Manchester City last season the challenge for a Liverpool team juggling five competitions and a marathon festive period is simply to stay put. In eight of the past 11 seasons the leaders on Christmas Day have gone on to clinch the title but Liverpool, eerily, have been the exception on each of those three occasions.“I forgot actually how it feels,” said Klopp beaming. “That was the most used word when I came in the dressing room: ‘Clean sheet, clean sheet, clean sheet.’ Obviously everybody was desperate for that and now we have it, so let’s have it more often. The next game where a clean sheet would be useful is already around the corner, against Salzburg on Tuesday.”With one eye on that match – Liverpool must avoid defeat to guarantee qualification to the Champions League knockout stages – Klopp again rotated and made seven changes but they beat Bournemouth with such ease that he was able to hand the teenager Curtis Jones his league debut. After giving Salah, Jordan Henderson and Roberto Firmino a breather in midweek, this time Klopp left Mané and Trent Alexander-Arnold on the bench, although the latter replaced Dejan Lovren five minutes before half-time. By that point Liverpool had established a two-goal lead after Bournemouth unravelled following an injury to Nathan Aké.Bournemouth are teetering above the relegation zone after a fifth consecutive defeat and a galling afternoon was compounded by injuries to Aké and Callum Wilson, with both clutching their hamstrings as they departed prematurely. Harry Wilson, ineligible to face his parent club, looked on from the stands alongside Bournemouth’s walking wounded, with Eddie Howe’s injury list mounting at the worst possible time. “It’s probably the biggest challenge we’ve ever faced since we came into the Premier League,” Howe said. “The game seemed to hinge on Nathan’s injury. It was a hammer blow, a double-whammy with the injury and the goal and we never recovered.”With this the first of five games in 11 days Liverpool initially appeared to pace themselves, patiently probing in search of an incisive opening –and when Aké was withdrawn 10 minutes before the interval, Bournemouth were unsettled and the visitors unleashed their killer instinct. Henderson played a wonderful raking ball downfield in search of Oxlade-Chamberlain, who easily eluded Chris Mepham and prodded beyond Aaron Ramsdale.Without Aké, Bournemouth’s back line was always susceptible to further damage. Firmino almost applied the finishing touches to an Alexander-Arnold cross, before an exquisite backheel by Salah freed Keïta to score his first goal of the season. A swell of supporters gasped as Salah flicked the ball into the path of the midfielder, who rounded off an effortless give-and-go by poking home, and the match soon descended into a harrowing game of defence versus attack.Alexander-Arnold continued to pierce holes down the Bournemouth left as Liverpool toyed with their opponents and it seemed only a matter of time before Salah, who had twice gone close, got in on the act. When Aké’s replacement, Jack Simpson, gave the ball to Keïta, Liverpool sensed blood and their next move seemed almost inevitable. Keïta slid in a weighted pass for Salah, who raced in behind Mepham before squeezing the ball into the far corner. “It was an absolutely super performance,” Klopp said. “The team performance was really mature and professional – just what we needed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46eff1c53fcea2b72f7306dfc93fd464cd4f99e9/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07eea020267508e9bbb52d58b6d447df","title":"marcus rashford manchester united manchester city premier league","story":"Is there a better attacking player in the country right now than Marcus Rashford? There’s a sentence you wouldn’t have expected to read eight weeks ago.The answer, to be fair, is probably maybe or may I introduce you to Sadio Mané, Son Heung-min and Jamie Vardy or better still – never mind that, just enjoy the show.It has been three years now as a first-team player for Rashford. There have been glimpses in that time, but never quite the numbers. Speed, skill, grace: here is a man who looks like a beautifully high-class attacker right up until the moment he has some high-class attacking to do.Rashford has the numbers now. The opening goal in this 2-1 victory for Manchester United at the home of the champions made it 13 in his last 14 games for club and country. He was helped early on by an utterly spooked Manchester City defence. Later he was pushed to the fringes as City kept the ball, pulled a goal back and might have turned the game on its head.But Rashford was irresistible in that opening half hour, cutting a series of elegant, magisterial lines with his runs off the back of the City midfield, a man playing with a kind of light around him.The extraordinary balance and speed has always been there, even in his lean times. Add to this a gathering sense of certainty, the willingness to dribble, to reel off the whole range of tricks and spins, and he becomes a genuinely fearsome opponent.United came to play from the start at the Etihad. Ole Gunnar Solskjær went for uncut speed and hustle in his front four, with Anthony Martial, Daniel James, Jesse Lingard and Rashford a daunting prospect for 34-year-old defensive fill-in Fernandinho and the reliably unreliable John Stones.This United against this City is a clash of styles in so many ways: zigzags versus straight lines, triangles versus squares. From the start there was a predictable rhythm, that heavy blue cloud pushing United back towards their own goal, all cuts and digs and teasing geometry.In between United broke with a thrilling sense of menace, red shirts haring across the halfway line three abreast like a 60m sprint semi-final. Even before they took the lead there were four fine chances, each coming at the end of a move that found improbably huge green spaces in between the light blue shirts.With 20 minutes gone Rashford found space again, changed direction in that distinctive way, like a champion skier performing a parallel turn, then just decided to trust himself and run, drawing Bernardo Silva into a wrong-footed lunge.It was a clear penalty, one that was earned too, a product of Rashford’s ability to slink from side to side a little quicker than anyone given the job of stopping him. Rashford waited for the VAR check, swallowed down the three-minute delay, ambled up and nuzzled the kick into the corner of the net.United kept coming. Five minutes later Rashford shimmied right, stopped, then found himself all alone in front of goal on the edge of the area. He went for a casual, showy dink and hit the top of the bar. He does this quite a lot. It’s not just bad luck.Moments later it was 2-0. James and Martial combined beautifully under very little pressure, working a hole large enough for Martial to scuff a low shot into the net. United’s players reeled away en masse, hurtling like a flying red wedge towards the nearest corner flag, a team running on pure shared adrenaline.This level of one-way intensity was never really sustainable. City are too good. They pushed hard, pulled a goal back, and might easily have levelled it. But United showed some gristle too. At the end of which this slightly thrown-together team has arguably the best win of the current mini-era.Mourinho last week, Guardiola this. If football management worked like boxing Solskjær would have been parading the Etihad pitch at the end draped in lineal world title belts.In the real world this has been a wonderfully bracing week for Manchester United’s manager. His team has found a shape and a style, albeit one that seems likely to work best against teams that keep the ball and offer space for those counterattacks.But Solskjær will enjoy this moment, and rightly so. This is such a difficult job. Managing Manchester United is like trying to invade the Siberian tundra. The horizon just keeps on moving away, the sky growing larger, the hills more distant. For the last six years it has simply absorbed energy, offering little back but blame and acrimony.Doubts will of course remain. But this week has brought the first suggestion of actual improvement. Look up and United are five points off fourth spot in the table. Best of all there is a glimpse now of an evolving Ole-ball style, meat on the bones of all that talk about pace and fitness and hard-running attack. For Solskjær Rashford has become a defining note in a way of playing, a way of trying to be Manchester United. He repaid that faith here handsomely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a09b504d495a508aa9b65afa834fd0e35101012/0_315_4473_2685/master/4473.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61a393b1628b28a51ccc2234ba17a879","title":"tottenham hotspur burnley premier league match report","story":"He was the last player to leave the pitch and rightly so because, if ever somebody deserved to milk the applause of an appreciative crowd, it was Son Heung-min. The South Korean was magnificent here, delivering a display full of skill, craft and intent. On 32 minutes he combined those traits to score a goal they will be talking about on the Seven Sisters Road, in Seoul and elsewhere for some time to come.It came from nowhere. To be specific, it came from a Burnley free-kick that Jan Vertonghen managed to hook clear under pressure from James Tarkowski and which neither he nor anyone else in attendance could have imagined would turn into an assist. But that is what happened as the ball fell to Son just outside Tottenham’s area and he set off, dribbling towards glory.There were seven Burnley players between the 27-year-old and the visitors’ goal and none of them could get near him. Robbie Brady, Tarkowski, Matthew Lowton and Ben Mee were among those who were outpaced while Erik Pieters’ attempt to stop Son with a swiping tackle midway inside Burnley’s half was dismissed with ease. Son could not be stopped, would not be stopped and, having travelled approximately 90 yards in 15 seconds, he put the ball past Nick Pope with a right-footed finish that was as composed as the buildup had been thrilling.As Son slid to his knees those watching went either wild in celebration or silent through shock and for Spurs it meant this game had been won before half-time.They were 3-0 up after Harry Kane and Lucas Moura had also scored in the opening nine minutes. By the end, with Kane having struck again and Moussa Sissoko securing his second goal in three games, the hosts had delivered their best performance of the José Mourinho era. In contrast to how they performed in defeat at Old Trafford in midweek, Spurs were full of intensity and aggression, their passing quick, their movement slick.Little wonder Mourinho was all smiles afterwards and from him came a typically attention-grabbing piece of praise for the man of the match. Yes, that’s right, he compared Son to the original Ronaldo.“Even before this goal my son calls him Sonaldo Nazário,” he said. “Today he was Sonaldo Nazário because the thing that came to my mind is the goal where I had the honour to be sitting next to Sir Bobby Robson – Compostela versus Barcelona, 1996, and Ronaldo Nazário got the ball behind the midfield line and scored a very similar goal. Amazing goal.”Ronaldo’s goal against Compostela was indeed amazing – iconic even – and it would be stretching it to say Son’s is at the same level. Nevertheless, it was a stunning contribution during arguably the forward’s best display for Spurs since joining the club in August 2015. Having been presented with his Asian international player of the year award before kick-off, he was a constant menace from the left wing and, as well as scoring Spurs’ third goal, contributed to their first two.There were barely four minutes on the clock when Son played a pass to Kane that resulted in him lashing a 35-yard shot past Pope. After Son drifted past Tarkowski inside Burnley’s area, he hit a shot that Pope managed to save with his foot but the keeper could not prevent a goal after the ball landed at the feet of Lucas at the back post after a deflection off Mee and a flick-on by Dele Alli.Nine minutes into the second half Alli then played the pass to Kane that led to him securing his 25th goal for club and country this season with another emphatic finish. The England captain then turned provider himself, exchanging passes with Sissoko before the French midfielder poked the ball past Pope.Burnley had chances to score themselves, most notably through headers by Brady and Jay Rodriguez in the first half, but they were well beaten, as Sean Dyche conceded. For his counterpart it was a day to savour, in part because it included a first clean sheet of his reign here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf086b107e82a0f05f64ef841e6320e0e647e503/0_242_4973_2983/master/4973.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d9b7d14152ff2642448b9e2917897a4","title":"aleksander ceferin long nose var offside conundrum","story":"Jordan Ellenberg is a professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin, whose book How Not To Be Wrong – the Hidden Maths of Everyday Life makes only one, oblique reference to football anywhere in its 18 chapters. Aleksander Ceferin, a former lawyer from Slovenia, is the president of Uefa, the sport’s European governing body. They do not, on the face of it, have a great deal in common, but given Ceferin’s suggestion this past week that VAR is, by and large, “a mess”, he might like to know that Ellenberg has an interesting argument as to why that might be the case.Ceferin, who was interviewed by the Daily Mirror, was talking about VAR in general, but ultra-tight offside decisions in particular. “If you have a long nose,” he said, “you can be in an offside position these days. Also the lines are drawn by the VARs. So it’s a bit subjective drawing of objective criteria.”There was a rhetorical question in the pre-VAR age that wormed its way into almost every discussion on the subject. “If the technology is there and it works,” its proponents would say, “then why not use it?”Which is where the maths professor from Wisconsin comes in, because Ellenberg has an answer. The question is rhetorical no longer. “There’s such a thing,” he argues, in a chapter devoted to closely fought elections, “as being too precise”.It is, on the face of it, a somewhat unexpected view for a mathematician to take. There are sound reasons, after all, why we don’t just assume that pi is close enough to three that it makes no difference.It would make more sense, Ellenberg argues, to decide the outcome on the flip of a coin. Some, he says, will recoil from the idea of choosing leaders by chance, and yet “close elections are already decided by chance”, be it “bad weather in the big city, a busted voting machine in an outlying town” or any one of dozens of potential random variables.For tight elections, read marginal offsides. The point about ultra-precision is that it is all well and good when there is a single thing to measure. Hawk-Eye works well in tennis, for instance, but then, it is only the ball that is moving. The line is fixed, and so the ball is either in or out (and it is maybe no coincidence that whenever the “Why not use it?” question raised its head in the VAR debate , the “Technology works in tennis” line was rarely far behind). But what happens when there’s a lot more going on? Digital systems reduce every challenge and question to a long line of zeros and ones, which is fine for essentially quantitative problems. The more qualitative the data, however, the greater the issues that extreme precision is likely to present.In an offside decision, there are often four moving objects, all heading in slightly, or sometimes completely, opposite directions: two attackers, one defender and the ball. It’s five if you include the referee’s assistant. Impose absolute precision on that and Ceferin’s “long nose” problem is all but inevitable. The problem is not that the technology is not working. It is that it is working too well.This makes his proposed solution rather troubling. The answer, Ceferin says, is tolerance. “Our proposal will be that it is a tolerance of 10-20cm,” he said. “It’s OK if you don’t rule someone offside if it’s one centimetre. The meaning of offside is that I have to have some kind of advantage.”Presumably this would mean that if the flag does not go up, a goal is scored and an attacker is shown to have been offside in the buildup by “no more than 10-20cm” the goal will stand. It is, in a sense, an attempt to turn the precision knob down from its current 11, to five or six. It hopes to blur the picture slightly, in the same way that it would if the VAR officials were forced to work with a 30-year-old black and white telly.But they won’t be working with old tech. They will still be drawing lines one pixel wide on an ultra-high definition screen, and the level of “tolerance” will need to be a lot more precise – that word again – than simply “10-20cm”. If not, there will be constant debate over goals that are legal at one end of the scale but ruled out at the other. It will, in other words, still be possible to be “a nose” over the line. It will just be a slightly different line.And while Ceferin may not think that 10-20cm constitutes “an advantage”, the Premier League’s quickest attackers, and the defenders tasked with controlling them, might well beg to differ. Handling Raheem Sterling is a tough task for defenders as it is. Sterling +20cm could be all but unplayable.The danger is that tinkering with VAR will exaggerate the current irritations, creating more interventions and more post-goal longueurs when no one can celebrate, while kicking off just as many arguments about whether the final decision was “right”.When the Observer asked a fan of every Premier League team a series of questions about their season so far a fortnight ago, their antipathy towards VAR was almost unanimous. Just two expressed anything close to a positive opinion, and both cheerfully admitted that it was because – so far – it has worked in their team’s favour. The responses of the other 18 were either largely or wholly negative. Such, it seems, is the price to be paid for being too precise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5de6f9c70553f3c20a502800a53e0579c024c4e3/266_400_4378_2627/master/4378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0484b7cebdaf117adf617f8860aaab8f","title":"champions league spoiled inequality super rich versus rest","story":"What have we done to deserve this? The last round of Champions League group fixtures is on us and only half the qualifiers are already known. There will actually be something to play for, intrigue on both nights, which is rare enough by this stage. Football is spoiling us.Liverpool, the holders, could conceivably go out. There’s a head-to-head showdown between Shakhtar Donetsk and Atalanta. There are complicated permutations to determine which two of Chelsea, Ajax and Valencia go through. It has been a better group stage than most. And yet it remains easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for an outsider to reach the last 16 of the Champions League.Most striking, perhaps, have been Salzburg. Erling Braut Haaland has, understandably, drawn most of the attention, but Hwang Hee-chan and Dominik Szoboszlai also offer evidence of Salzburg’s capacity to identify and develop young talent.It’s easy to admire Ralf Rangnick, the studious and polite head of research and development at Red Bull, and the structures he has put in place. But then you remember that, well, it’s Red Bull. If they do beat Liverpool to go through, it will be a remarkable achievement for a side that have not been in the group stage since 1994-95 and are based on youth. But it’s a funny kind of fairytale that is funded by a global energy drinks giant – as though the prince were to hack through the briars, scale the tower and wake Sleeping Beauty with a can of Relentless.Dinamo Zagreb were much better than anybody expected and thrashed Atalanta 4-0 in their opening game, their second win in the Champions League group stage in 15 years. Club Brugge had their moments, most notably in the Bernabéu where they were unfortunate not to beat Real Madrid. And Slavia Prague will cherish the memories of their draws at Internazionale and Barcelona. Olympiakos came from 2-0 down to force a draw against Tottenham.Those four all raised hopes in early autumn that perhaps there really could be life in the group stage. And yet between them, for all the goodwill and words of praise they take with them, they have won one of their 20 group games in this season’s competition.And there have been just as many mismatches as usual. If a hammering is defined as one team scoring at least five and winning by at least four, there have been six so far in this season’s competition – albeit one was Bayern’s freakish 7-2 victory over Tottenham, which had far more to do with two ruthlessly in-form goalscorers and the capitulation of a team short on confidence than on any financial disparity between the teams. That compares with five, nine, eight and five in the previous four seasons.But the problem is less the occasional big scoreline than the lack of jeopardy. Real Madrid barely woke up till November yet still went through with two games to spare. The second group game against Paris Saint-Germain was an actual dead rubber but the first meeting might as well have been. PSG dominated and deserved their 3-0 win and it made next to no difference to Madrid’s chances of going through.Tottenham, Manchester City and Barcelona barely seem to have cleared their throats and yet find themselves through with a game to spare. Liverpool have come under a little pressure largely, it feels, because the Champions League group games have become the time when they feel they can let their intensity relax (that and the weird hang-up with Napoli).Chelsea will go through if they beat Lille, who have just one point so far, at Stamford Bridge. Atlético Madrid will be eliminated if they fail to beat bottom-of-the-group Lokomotiv Moscow at home and Bayer Leverkusen beat Juventus. Both, realistically, should progress. They and Liverpool aside, the other live issues are all squabbles between sides of similar stature and resource. The pattern is the same as it ever was: a couple of vaguely interesting games early on, then money flexes its muscle and the familiar clubs from the same old countries will be back in February when the real business starts.Perhaps it doesn’t matter. Perhaps in a world in which brief clips of brilliant players doing brilliant things seem of greater value than the ebbs and flows of a full competitive 90 minutes, it is logical. Perhaps this makes more money – and that, after all, is the true meaning of modern sport.But still, you would like to think that context matters at least to an extent, which is why Liverpool’s comeback against Barcelona, or Tottenham’s dramatic progress past Manchester City and Ajax last season were so celebrated. Is it too much to ask that a little of that drama be present in the group stage, that the pre-Christmas games might be more than an elongated and lucrative warm-up?In truth, it probably is. For 40 years, in football and without, the rich have been getting richer and the gulf to the rest has been widening. How can football federations be expected to tackle the iniquities of global economics? This week, as the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, floated plans for investment in a pan-African league to raise standards there, it was revealed that the Madrid president, Florentino Pérez, has been in talks with private equity companies about another variant of a European super league.As the knockout stages of the Champions League have demonstrated recently, concentrating talent at a handful of clubs can produce brilliant, thrilling football. But is the price of grotesque inequality really worth paying?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e563f7033342bc1dd1cf7d8e38c5ae9ae7550be9/0_88_2931_1759/master/2931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99007d05ea0cc119b8bda01e1713141e","title":"allan jenkins allotment plot 29 nasturtiums flowers in winter","story":"The tenacious flowers still face off against December’s cold days, so it’s time to plan for next year’s long campaign of colourIt seems barely possible.

As a tradition it offers a reassuringly familiar checklist of experiences after a busy and unpredictable year – and, no matter how little sense they make (do we really gain anything from pulling crackers except for a small pile of mess on the dinner table?), we return to our yuletide customs without fail.Festive food and drink is a perfect example of this. The turkey, the stuffing, the Christmas pudding, the mulled wine, the eggnog each has its own inidual merits, of course, but indulging in all of them in one day is ridiculous unless you’re actively trying for indigestion. But each gives us that all-important, indescribable feeling of Christmas, so we persist at our peril. To hit all the positive psychological triggers that festive food and drink provides, without the digestive drawbacks of piling decadence after decadence on your poor stomach, would be a Christmas miracle, and getting creative with drinks, in particular, could be the answer.There’s no reason why drinks can’t be evocative without being overly rich and competing with – rather than complementing – your Christmas food. That’s the philosophy on which mixologist and Grey Goose global ambassador Joe McCanta has based his collection of seasonal vodka cocktails, which are offered up as lighter alternatives to the likes of eggnog. “It’s actually a really heavy drink,” McCanta says, the slight strain in his voice suggesting he’s imagining trying to get through a glass.“When you think about it, you’re taking something that has tons of cream, tons of eggs, and mixing it with heavy dark spirits such as cognac, bourbon or rum. And frankly, it’s hard to enjoy more than half a glass of eggnog for me.”Mulled wine, another festive favourite, can be just as challenging for a stomach filled with food, and it’s a logistical nightmare if you want to do it right. “It goes too hot, or it sits for too long, it may taste one way at the start but by the time you’re serving guests half an hour into the party it tastes completely different,” says McCanta.These drinks, he argues, are simply vehicles for elements that create a festive atmosphere. “Aroma is the single best way of triggering memory,” he says, calling out cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and clementine as the sensory equivalent of sleigh bells, stimulating memories of Christmases past and reminding you it’s that time of year when comfort and rest are the priority. Once you realise that, the drinks through which you recall those memories can be changed. And that is where vodka comes in.“The greatest thing about vodka is that it’s by far the most versatile of any spirit,” says McCanta. “I don’t know any spirit from which you can make such varied types of cocktail as a Bloody Mary, to a Moscow Mule, to an Espresso Martini .” This flexibility, plus its lightness, means that a festive vodka cocktail can sit happily alongside the most indulgent turkey dinner, imbued with all manner of festive flavours from warming apple crumble to spicy ginger and soul-stirring nutmeg. So why not shake things up this Christmas with one of the following festive inventions?Season’s Celebrations“It’s an apple crumble in a glass,” says McCanta. “You’ve got cinnamon and nutmeg that are just kind of sprinkled over the top. It’s essentially just as easy to make as a gin and tonic, but so much more interesting.”Build in a rocks glass over ice. Garnish with an apple fan and sprinkle with cinnamon, nutmeg and demerara sugar.Sleigh Driver“Blood orange and pomegranate: these are two ingredients that are totally in season in the Mediterranean during the winter months,” says McCanta. “So I was inspired by what you can get at this time of year and using that to the best of my ability.”50ml Grey Goose Vodka150ml fresh pomegranate juiceSplash of pomegranate blood orange syrupBuild in a wine goblet over ice, and garnish with a fresh wedge of lemon skewered with 3 cloves and a few pomegranate seeds.Winter Scarves“I love things like Bénédictine, which is a French liqueur that has 27 herbs and spices in it,” says McCanta. It certainly packs a festive punch, containing myrrh, clove, orange peel, cinnamon and nutmeg among other ingredients (including six that are a closely guarded trade secret).30ml Grey Goose Vodka22.5ml Bénédictine liqueur2 lemon wheels1 slice of fresh ginger1 large cinnamon stick60ml boiling waterAdd all ingredients to a mug and stir, leaving to infuse for a few minutes.

Now a fashion commentator and lecturer, her experiences mean she’s learned plenty over the years.Nobody is judging you, trust meI’ve definitely observed a change over the years in myself – I’m less bothered by what others think. I’ve learned that most people are concerned with their own lives and are too busy thinking about their own stories. When we’re younger we don’t realise that, and that realisation is quite liberating.Use clothes to tell a storyI’ve always had a real interest in clothes and the way they can talk on our behalf. I learned very early on that I could earn myself a certain amount of notoriety at school if I got sent home for not wearing the uniform. I’ve always known what I wanted to wear and why, and have always respected the power of clothes. If I’m doing a job, for example, I put on clothing that speaks to others in terms of my creativity and professionalism – it’s a costume. Think about what you want to convey and what it is you want people to know about you.Your definition of success might change (and that’s OK)Now, my definition is very simple: if I can learn, pay my bills and have fun, then I see myself as very successful. Most days, I can do two out of those three things, so as far as I’m concerned I’m extremely successful! I think that’s realistic and allows me to be the person I need to be.Connections are better in personWorking as a fashion editor in the 1980s meant I became very good at networking. We didn’t have social media, so we had to network in real life. I’m big on real-life meetings instead of phone calls or emails, whether it’s work or socialising – you get so much more than you bargained for. Nowadays, I like socialising in small groups over a drink rather than big, noisy rooms, so I can make a connection. The older I get, the more I value making connections, no matter how simple.Ageing is the best thing that will happen to youGetting older is brilliant. I’ve been thrilled with the intellectual growth I’ve experienced, the way my perceptions and motivations have changed and the knowledge I’ve gained about myself and what it is to be human. I’ve really learned to enjoy life and prioritise the things that matter. I had a seminal experience in my 20s – my boyfriend (who became the father of my eldest daughter) was diagnosed with a very serious illness and became very ill. It was a valuable lesson and I felt lucky my body was functional. Maybe that’s why I’ve never given myself a hard time about my appearance.Ignore trends and avoid fast fashionAs the oldest of five children, my mother made my clothes as a child because it was cheaper than buying them. I was into customising early and would change the clothes she made me to suit my style, and help me express myself. My advice to anyone reading this now is the same: buy less and really look after it. Swap clothes, avoid fast fashion and learn to make or customise your own looks. Ignore trends. Wear what makes you happy and feel like you.Make social media work for youSocial media can be useful – I often use it for research and contacting people. I tell students I lecture that it’s like a car: if it’s being driven by someone carefully then it can be a great tool, but if it’s driven by someone who is irresponsible who then creates an accident, it can be very bad. It really depends on the driver, so always consider how you’re using it.Confidence and authenticity come with ageTo me, being authentic means being honest – accepting who I am and not pretending to be someone else, and that really does get easier with age. I was always authentic when I was younger, but I thought I wasn’t good enough and would constantly compare myself with others. But every one of us is authentic. Having the confidence to display your unique voice instead of hiding it or trying to suppress it, that comes with age. When you grow into yourself, you stop seeking other people’s opinions and trust your own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ce593bc924c82650bff58f46abe5ebb0dd7b6f9/0_258_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab86e0215add5cc5da02636474055a9d","title":"can you ask family to contribute financially at christmas","story":"My brother and his partner always come to us and we’re wondering if it’s fair to ask them to chip inEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.My brother and his partner (in their early 30s) live in a one-bed flat and never host the family Christmas – they always come to us.

You get one digit wrong on the sort code, and send a huge amount of cash to the wrong person. They refuse to return it, and the bank washes its hands of the matter, blaming you for the mistake.That’s what happened to Peter Teich in a case that reveals shocking lapses in Britain’s banking system. Just hours after a solicitor sent the Cambridge resident his £193,000 inheritance after the death of his 100-year-old father, it became apparent that a terrible mistake had been made.Teich had given his correct name, address and Barclays account number in Cambridge to his solicitor – but the wrong sort code. The money went straight to another Barclays customer, also in the Cambridge area who, alarmingly, had an account with the same number as Teich, though a slightly different sort code. Worse, the person refused to return the money. Barclays knew where his £193,000 was sitting and, Teich says, knew when the recipient dishonestly began to withdraw the cash.From the end of March next year, name checks will be carried out when UK bank customers send money to other people.The move is designed to tackle the rapidly-growing problem of bank transfer fraud. But there has been criticism of the fact that it has been delayed – it was originally set to start last summer, according to reports.At the moment, anyone wanting to transfer money is asked for the recipient’s account name, account number and sort code. However, it’s typically the case that the bank does not check if the account name is correct.The so-called “confirmation of payee” system that is being introduced from 31 March 2020 will mean customers can check they are paying the right person. When a customer sets up a new payment, their bank etc will be able to check the name of the person or organisation they intend to pay against the actual name held on the account.There will be three possible outcomes. If they used the correct account name, they will receive confirmation that the details match, and can proceed with the payment.If they used a similar name to the account holder, they will be provided with the actual name to check. They can then update the details and try again, or contact the intended recipient to check the details.But if the customer enters the wrong name for the account holder, they will be told the details do not match and advised to contact the person they are trying to pay.The mistaken transfer – called “misapplied funds” in banking parlance – could not have occurred if UK banks matched up sort codes and account numbers with the account holder’s name. But they do not. A recipient’s name could be given as Mickey Mouse and the bank would still process the payment, using the sort code and account number alone.The banking industry promised that from mid-2019 name checks would be carried out when customers sent money to other people, largely to halt a rising tide of bank transfer fraud. But the timetable was delayed, and it will now not come into force until the end of March next year.An oddity in Teich’s case is that Barclays also appeared to have identical account numbers for two different customers, both in the Cambridge area.Teich realised the error almost immediately. His father’s estate was ided with his sister, who emailed him at noon on the day of the transfer, 26 April, to say she had received her £193,000. Teich checked his account, found nothing there, and contacted his solicitor. Only then did he discover he had given the solicitor the wrong sort code. The solicitor immediately contacted Barclays, which said the money would be restored within a week, according to Teich. But in late May, Teich received a bombshell letter from Barclays: “Due to an error on your part, the funds were applied to another customer … clearly you were mis-advised about the funds being restored to your account, and in recognition of this, I have credited your account with a small token gesture of £25.”Barclays said it asked the person who received the cash for permission to return the money, but he refused. In a letter a few days later to Teich’s solicitor, it said: “Regrettably we have not been able to gain permission from the recipient of these funds for them to be returned to you. As there has been no error here on the part of the bank, we cannot just simply return the funds.”No one is legally entitled to keep money that has been wrongfully credited to their account. But compelling them to return the money, particularly if it is spent, is another matter. Barclays, in common with other banks, will not even provide the name of the person who has received the cash, unless it is instructed by a court.Some  readers may recognise Teich’s surname, as his father, Mikuláš – from whom he inherited the £193,000 – was the subject of an obituary in the paper in April. Mikuláš escaped from Nazi-held Czechoslovakia in 1939, although his parents perished in the Holocaust. He later became a renowned historian of science at Cambridge.Despite being 74 and disabled, Peter Teich was left on his own to recover his father’s £193,000. “Barclays insisted that I bear the full and sole responsibility of pursuing their own dishonest customer,” he says. He hired lawyers and went through an expensive and laborious two-stage legal process. In June, after £12,000 in legal and court fees, he got the other Barclays customer’s name. Armed with this, he then went to the high court to obtain a freezing injunction – at a cost of £34,000. Finally, after an “unnecessary, expensive and stressful process”, the court order forced the other Barclays customer to repay the cash.“I freely acknowledge my mistake in this unhappy saga: I provided the sort code of the wrong Barclays branch. But my error fades into near insignificance when considered in the context of Barclays’ conduct,” says Teich.The saga did not stop there. Teich asked Barclays to refund the £46,000 in legal costs he racked up simply to recover his own money. Barclays refused. Angered by the bank’s reply, Teich contacted the  for help. We asked it to reconsider his case, and in an almost immediate U-turn, it has now agreed to pay all his legal fees, and has offered him £750 in compensation.In a statement the bank said: “It is evident that on this occasion we have failed to meet the high standards that Mr Teich can expect to receive from Barclays, and for this we have offered our sincere apologies. After taking a closer look at this situation, we can confirm that Mr Teich can expect the fees he has incurred to be refunded in full with interest, together with a payment for the distress and inconvenience this matter has caused.”Teich is jubilant he will now no longer be out of pocket. But he regrets Barclays’ behaviour. “It could have taken Barclays a few days to recover the misdirected funds, but instead they did nothing. They could have saved me and everyone else all this stress and anxiety. Had the confirmation of payee measures been in place at the time of the transfer, I would not have gone through the costly process of recovering my funds. All the same, Barclays could have done the right thing and intervened when there was still time to do so.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a988e6df3ea08b79e67d0128f6aae92ae3f345b7/0_585_3440_2063/master/3440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=309dbc07609c633bf2e67943fa5e5840","title":"store credit lures young generation into debt","story":"The prospect of buying a sofa or a new kitchen used to be an intimidating prospect for many households – a large outlay that would blow the budget. But then came “buy now, pay later” credit, which meant families could buy in store and spread payments over a few years.These loans soon gained a bad reputation and shrank away, but did not vanish. Now they have re-emerged, rebranded and aimed at a technologically aware generation of shopper – while also being blamed in part for the mushrooming debt that UK consumers are drowning in.“The rise of ‘buy now, pay later’ retailing is of great concern, as more people are being enticed into high-cost debt that they may struggle to repay,” said Ros Altmann, the campaigner and former pensions minister. “Financial resilience across the population is weakening, debt levels are rising and if too many customers are unable to repay their debts in future, we could see a repeat of the financial crisis.”Previously known as shop credit or interest-free deals, this type of credit has been around for years, giving interest-free periods during which consumers could repay loans, but charging interest after that period. The idea was to make big-ticket items affordable. While most people would think they could pay off the money in the interest-free period, life frequently got in the way and they ended up paying interest.Now the loans are back, and they’re far more widespread, both in stores and online. But they are rarely marketed under the buy now, pay later banner consumers are more likely to be told that they can make “lifestyle” choices and remain in control of how they pay.“They’re high-interest loans in drag. Don’t be fooled. Many loans don’t even mention that they’re a form of credit. It’s ‘different ways to pay’,” said Martyn James from complaints website Resolver. In October, Marks \u0026amp Spencer was the latest retailer to announce a buy now, pay later service on its website to attract customers and boost pre-Christmas trade.Previously, people would have many months or even years to pay back their loan. In some cases now, that can be 30 days and for much smaller amounts. So if someone takes out a series of little loans they can quickly lose track of how much they owe and when they have to repay it, risk running up interest payments.Problems start are when people take out multiple loans and get confused about what to pay when. It is also, says James, easy to “sleepwalk” into these types of credit as they don’t feel like loans. This is especially the case online where a box can be ticked to say that terms have been read. The advance of technology has meant that consumers can be approved for loans much quicker than before, which results in them being able to get credit while they are in store.Because of the speed with which this kind of credit has spread, concern has been raised at how younger generations are being affected, especially as many of the retailers selling “fast fashion” now offer credit options. Some shoppers have found themselves in debt as a result of not returning goods on time.Eileen Adamson, founder of financial coaching site Your Money Sorted, says it promotes poor financial decision making, which can lead on to problems in later life.“Many of these transactions are for relatively small amounts, meaning that we don’t give them much thought, before purchasing. Imagine delaying payment for five purchases of £30, leaving you owing £150. These small purchases are easy to ‘forget’ and each time you look at your bank account, you could think you are £150 better off than you actually are,” she said.“This can then lead to spending more money, because you feel flush. If this pattern is repeated regularly, then before long you will find yourself being unable to afford the repayments. It’s just too easy to spend more than you can afford, especially when the companies actively encourage you to buy multiple items, and return them if they don’t suit. We all know that this is just another way of encouraging us to buy more, and thereby increase their profits.”“I would like to see regulators insisting on cooling-off periods and checks before customers are allowed to take on debts. The risk of another economic crisis, caused by irresponsible lending, is rising and regulators should take this seriously.”The website Resolver has received almost 7,500 complaints about “buy now, pay later”-style deals in the past year. In one case, a woman from Scotland had opened an account with one of the major retailers and was offered ever-expanding credit limits.However, she became confused and did not grasp when she had to pay for the items she had bought, and her bill soon stood at more than £2,000 even though she did not have a job and was struggling to make payments. With late-payment fees and interest, the amount she owed was soon much more than she had spent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed1ceeb4f5a77e631f23c6af988e679b8d0b70ff/0_330_7987_4793/master/7987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1d1dbf779db0c1249c3b0ecefbef8c0","title":"john legend the key to happiness is to open your mind to love ","story":"A phenomenally successful singer-songwriter and social justice campaigner, or a preachy virtue-signaller? Ryan Bradley meets John LegendJohn Legend springs up from his mahogany grand piano in the high-ceilinged, light-drenched living room of his Hollywood home and greets me with a grin, a hello, and one of those very smooth handshakes that seamlessly morph into an extremely brief hug. My palms are sweaty and my face is flushed. Until a moment ago, I’d been running up the road that leads to Legend’s hilltop house, late because of the traffic. And now I’m sweatily, awkwardly apologising to John Legend in his beautiful living room as he gestures towards another room where there’s a long table by the window that overlooks the morning haze and the distant ridges of the Santa Monica mountains.“Let’s just zen out in this zen dining room,” John Legend says, before looking around the room as if for the first time, running his hands over the dark-wood table, leaning back in his chair, lifting his head. He inhales, exhales, beams. And then he laughs – a long, deep, rich baritone. The laugh alone is like a song. And the traffic? What traffic? We are in Legend-land. Troubles are distant memories.Legend has this effect on almost everybody, and it has brought him great success. His debut album, 2004’s Get Lifted, sold 3m copies worldwide, and its single, Ordinary People, was so ubiquitous that for a solid chunk of the mid-aughts it was inescapable. His 2013 release, All of Me, written for the model Chrissy Teigen, his then-fiancée-now-wife, who he met on a music video shoot, has been played on Spotify more than 1bn times. Legend is still mainly a musician. He goes into the studio most days, and he has his seventh album coming out next year. But lately he’s transformed into something more. He’s on TV all the time, not just as a coach on The Voice, but subbing for Ellen DeGeneres on her show, and playing Jesus in a live on-air version of Jesus Christ Superstar. It makes sense that Legend played Jesus: few entertainers are so broadly popular, and fewer still are the kind of politically engaged moral arbiter of our troubled times that he has become.And yet, despite (or because of) all of that, he has another effect, too. There is something about him, his family, his way of being in the world, that pisses certain people off. In September, Donald Trump tweeted at Legend (“boring musician”) and Teigen (“filthy mouthed wife”) after the pair appeared at an event focused on criminal justice held at New York’s notorious Sing Sing prison. Last month, after the release of Legend’s Christmas album, A Legendary Christmas, a collection of originals and classic covers, Piers Morgan described him as “Hollywood’s self-appointed Virtue-Signaller-in-Chief”.I mention how I’d been listening to the album that morning. “It’s a mood-enhancer,” Legend says. “When you’re humming Christmas songs all summer, it’s very therapeutic.” Yet there is one song on the album that a lot of people found not very therapeutic at all, and that song is a cover of Baby It’s Cold Outside. Legend has changed some of the song’s lyrics to be more modern and less – some would say – rapey.He knew there was controversy around the original: some radio stations had banned it last winter and it had been cancelled by various factions on the internet. But he thought that changing some lyrics to better reflect our more evolved era, where people are supposed to ask for consent, and include a few other fun modern flourishes, like a plotline featuring an impatient Uber driver named Murray, would be, well: “It would be fun, and it would be newsworthy. And – yeah – it was both.”Legend is downplaying here. Ever since his version was released last month, people – from Morgan to Dean Martin’s daughter – have lost their minds about it, exclaiming that the rewritten song is a travesty, an affront, a war on culture or the end of culture itself. This, to Legend, is absurd and exasperating. “The song was supposed to be silly!” he says. “It wasn’t supposed to be preachy at all. I never disparaged the old version. And, by the way, the original writer, or his family, gets paid for my version, too.”Normally, that would be the final word in that particular controversy. But Legend isn’t done with it. He grows thoughtful and leans forward in his seat. He speaks now in a lower, nearly hushed tone. “It’s interesting,” he says, “this whole backlash to the #MeToo movement. People thinking we’ve gone too far speaking up for a woman’s right to not get raped or sexually harassed, when some would argue we’ve not gone far enough, when we have an admitted sexual assailant in the highest office in the land. People think that because some people have lost their jobs, or have been expelled from Hollywood, like Weinstein, that we’ve gone too far. I don’t agree. But people wanted the Baby It’s Cold Outside war to be a proxy war for all that.”Weird, how that silly, funny song suddenly got very serious. It says a lot about where we are as a hyper-polarised, extremely online society in 2019. It also says quite a lot about who Legend is, not just as a politically engaged entertainer or as a hyper-talented youngest ever EGOT-getter (that’s his Emmy and 10 Grammys and Oscar and Tony ) or as a father of two or as a husband to the supermodel-slash-Queen of Twitter-slash-disarmingly honest lifestyle guru Teigen. No, the way to understand why it is that Legend can suddenly turn a silly song serious is that these are serious, fearful times. And the only way to match all the fear in our world is with a kind of radical, all encompassing love.But, first, give him a minute to explain what he means by love, exactly. To get there, you must first understand a criticism Legend receives, which is nicely summarised by Trump’s tweet. Here’s a popular singer, on TV, talking about criminal justice. What does he know? What right does he have?The thing is, Legend has been involved in prison reform for years. Also: education, poverty, HIVAids, disaster relief, food security, drug policy, childcare, military aid… People look at Legend, see all this do-gooder activism, and think to themselves: he can’t be for real, he can’t mean all this. Isn’t this just so much virtue signalling?“I don’t know what virtue signalling is supposed to be,” he says. “I get that people don’t like people who are overly preachy or overly moralising. But, in my humble opinion, if you care about people who are often undervalued and overlooked in society, what’s so negative about that? There seem to be some who think that standing up for immigrants whose kids are getting locked up in cages is… some might call that virtue signalling and some might think speaking up against it is absolutely right.”There’s a certainty to what he says and the way he says it that is absolutely correct and totally annoying. That’s the thing with people who have such a firm grip on their moral compass: they shame the rest of us. Legend is good. While the rest of us are just trying to catch our breath, flushed and sweaty and jittery. But then he reaches out a hand for a shake and pulls you right in and soothes you. Maybe you recoil. Or maybe you just give in.Fifteen years ago, I saw Legend on stage for the first time, belting out the backups and choruses at a Kanye West concert, already clearly en route to becoming a star. A year earlier he had been performing under his given name, John Stephens, in tiny jazz clubs throughout Philadelphia and New York as he worked a day job at the Boston Consulting Group. Then he and Kanye met, Kanye gave him the name Legend, and the rest, as they say, is history. But what is most striking about Legend back then versus Legend now is that the two people – John Legend and John Stephens – seem one and the same.Legend remembers that night as if it was yesterday, correcting me on some details, describing it as “the beginning”. I ask him about his and Kanye’s ergent paths, both artistically and politically, and offer up a theory I heard from another Kanye collaborator: that Kanye’s core beliefs in music and art and politics and everything, all of it, stems from the relentless pursuit of freedom. His quest for freedom is what led him to fashion, to Jesus, to supporting Trump.Legend agrees. “He wants to do what he thinks is the boldest, most unexpected and free thing,” he says. “Obviously I vehemently disagreed with the turn it took when it came to Trump, but I think that’s a common thread when it comes to the creative and life choices he’s made.”Does Legend have a core belief like that? Something that can be summed up in a word? “I think, yes, I do,” he says. “I think about love.” He takes a beat. “Love as a public virtue.” He shifts in his seat now, getting serious again. “Love in public is what Cornel West called justice, the idea that you value people’s lives no matter who they are or where they live or how different they are from you. All the differences we have, if you have the ability to love your neighbour, or not just your neighbour but – in church they defined neighbour as broadly as possible. And so I feel like – and I don’t always get it right – it’s that we should love our neighbour, which is everyone, as we love ourselves.” This is a radical thing, a radical love. “It’s not easy to do.”Legend has talked about this philosophy before, in a 2014 graduation speech he delivered at the University of Pennsylvania, his alma mater. “The key to success, the key to happiness, is opening your mind and your heart to love,” he told the graduates. He went on to tell the story of his upbringing in Springfield, Ohio – a small, blue-collar city where he was surrounded by family: four siblings and two parents “who cared so much about our education that they home-schooled us for several years during grade school.”His parents took in foster kids, helped the homeless, and were, Legend says, “like a model family in our church and local community.” But when Legend was 10, things fell apart. His grandmother died and his mother fell into a depression that would tear the family apart. His parents eventually orced. His mother disappeared from his life for more than a decade, addicted to drugs and sinking ever further into depression. “My world was shattered,” he said.He coped by deciding that “if I didn’t fall in love, no one could ever betray me like that again.” The only thing he allowed himself to love fully and without reservation was music and it was this love that gave him his career, the success and the money and the beautiful zen dining room with a view of the mountains. More than all of that, the love gave him the ability to forgive his mother. It was the love that gives him daily the capacity to take a deep breath and cooly and with great strength and certainty e into the fray, haters be damned.“When you actually care about something, you want to lead. Apathy’s not so cool any more,” he told the graduates. Which is another way of explaining why, even when talking about a silly old Christmas song and its modern rewrite, things can quickly turn so serious. It’s love.This core philosophy resides most fully in his life here at home. If you follow either Legend or, especially, Teigen on social media, you already have quite a good sense of what this life looks like. Even stepping into their home is like entering a bizarre world you’ve seen online and in magazine spreads. There’s no facade. There’s no mask.Legend wakes up at 6.30am, hangs out with his kids, works out, takes the kids to preschool (Luna, three) and music class (Miles, one), goes to the studio around noon, works until dinner, comes home, tucks the kids into bed. “Then I sit at home with Chrissy and watch reality shows and drink wine and live to face another day.” On Sundays he watches a lot of American football. He’s pretty sure the only surprise people would have about his life is that he rarely hangs out with other celebrities.There’s something radical in this, too – this normal, good, loving life lived openly and transparently. When we’re talking about his Christmas album, Legend mentions one of his biggest musical influences and in many ways the model for his career: the great jazz pianist and singer Nat King Cole. Legend covers Cole’s immortal Christmas Song on the album, but the influence goes far beyond just vocal stylings and keyboard chops. Cole was a trailblazer, the first black man ever to host a variety show on TV.He might not have been as outspoken as Legend, but to see him as apolitical is to read him, and history, wrong. The racism he faced as one of the most popular entertainers in America was relentless and horrific. When he moved his family into a wealthy all-white neighbourhood in Los Angeles in 1948, the neighbours burned the N-word in his lawn and killed his dog. His show was cancelled after a year because no major sponsor wanted to touch it. “Nat King Cole’s very existence was controversial,” Legend says.There is no escaping the fact that Legend’s existence, this life he is leading so happily and openly and successfully, is controversial to certain groups of people, too. Controversial is possibly too nice a word for it. Nobody is more aware of this uneasy truth than Legend himself. He reads his Twitter mentions. He is reminded daily, in the messages he receives online, of the haters, the racists, the bile spewed towards him and his family.Even today, on this nice zenned-out morning, he is bracing for the onslaught. Later on, he will be named People’s Sexiest Man Alive. He says this offhandedly, like, can you believe it? I ask him if he’s happy about it and he says he is, but he immediately adds that, truly, “this is a double- edged sword”. For the next several weeks he’ll be hearing all about all the other, sexier men who deserved the title more than he. And that is honestly sort of funny, but there’s a more sinister edge to it that he would rather not think about. All the gross hate that bubbles up when he triumphs in just about anything. “Maybe this is a day I don’t check my mentions,” he says.And yet, he goes on. “I see what’s happening and I feel compelled to say something. I could choose not to wade into these controversies. I realise it comes at some risk. But I just…” He stops. For the first time in our conversation it feels as if the flow has been interrupted, like he’s searching for the right word. “I just feel like – I can’t not.” He laughs at himself, at the honesty betrayed by the inarticulate phrase. He’s right, of course. Not an hour after I leave that morning, just a few hours before he’s officially crowned Sexiest Man Alive, he’s tweeting about White House senior advisor Stephen Miller’s recently uncovered racist emails. Of course he would be. He can’t not.John Legend’s album A Legendary Christmas is out now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa22653aa4c2813613611c50d0e63c188a8f552/0_0_3227_1936/master/3227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79cfa7762f75beec1a808b0a574bb253","title":"election 2019 inside momentum podcast","story":"Anushka Asthana reports from inside Momentum, the grassroots movement hoping to propel Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street.

Christmas seems a strange time for a Tory government to call an election possibly they guessed that it would be hard for Labour to sell hope in winter possibly they judged that goodwill to all men would be at its lowest after people had endured a December of accidentally answering the door to a canvasser because they thought it was an Amazon package. Then again, Conservatives would say that the story of Christmas chimes with their values, as it involves a pregnant refugee being treated quite badly.Let’s begin with the Tories. The cabinet is Dickensian in the purest sense: the sort of people who would need more than two ghosts to change their behaviour. After an uncertain start, Jacob Rees-Mogg has had a pretty good campaign, onboard an Arctic clipper ship, nailed into a coffin of earth from his constituency. It’s interesting that someone who thinks ordinary people lack common sense is so heavily invested in upholding the result of a referendum, but like so many lesser ironies in this election, we simply don’t have the time. When people say “The mask has slipped!” after various cabinet gaffes, there must be a moment when the minister wonders whether they have accidentally come out wearing one of the actual masks they wear to the various Eyes Wide Shut-style parties that dot their social calendar at this time of year their fingers moving reflexively towards their face to see if they’ve worn the head of a golden ibis to talk to Phillip Schofield.The Conservatives seem to have focused on the phrase “Get Brexit Done”, which has all the conviction of your dad hitting the arms of his chair and saying, “Right…” We also seem to be hearing a lot about “Unleashing Britain’s potential”, despite most of our potential being for food riots, and perhaps some kind of race war. The Conservative manifesto contains elements of both Thatcherism and Reaganism, in that it seems to have been written by someone with dementia. There was probably a discussion about whether to release a manifesto at all or simply airdrop scratchcards over key marginals.Boris Johnson, who looks like something you’d keep your pyjamas in, and who no reasonable person would choose to lead them into a chorus, has a strangely hunched demeanour perhaps from all the time he spends crammed inside married women’s wardrobes, like a randy jack-in-the-box. This confused sex yeti has been booed by nurses: people who can remove a dressing, examine a festering wound, and still look up at you with a smile. Has any party ever elected a new leader so tired and dated? With a delivery best approximated as a living checklist of stroke warnings, his bumbling posho shtick almost resembles buffering, a kind of 3G Wodehouse. He doesn’t even seem to enjoy it throughout the campaign he’s sported a face that looks as if it’s been kneaded by a baker going through a particularly bitter orce, and the irony that comes into his eyes every time he crowbars in a catchphrase means that he breaks the fourth wall more than Deadpool. We thought the office of prime minister was what he lived for, his consuming ambition. It’s all been a bit like hearing Tony The Tiger talk about his diabetes.Johnson’s deep investment in democracy is highlighted by the fact that his government has been dominated by an unelected special adviser. Usually people with levels of mental activity as low as Johnson’s aren’t surrounded by advisers, but their weeping parents and a member of their favourite boy band. Dominic Cummings looks like he works in television (which I think might be the worst thing you can say about anyone), has the air of a startled testicle, and the name of a character in a porn parody of The Talented Mr Ripley (“The Talentless Fister Ripped Me”). Everyone who’s bored with Johnson pretending to be an idiot should look at Cummings and realise these people are far more dangerous when they pretend to be clever.It’s perfectly obvious why Johnson has been able to take power: he has an instinctive grasp on Brexit as rightwing eschatology, and he’s used to getting his own way, be it in the halls of Westminster or elbowing siblings off of nanny’s nipples. It’s only when you look at the hideous Tarot formed by his cabinet that you get a true picture of the depravity into which we are sinking. Take Michael Gove, a revanchist endorsement of the science of physiognomy. In any other era Gove would be seen as a uniquely unctuous, unlikable and profoundly talentless figure. Now he’s hardly even remarkable. Gove – looking like someone took all the flesh out of a serial killer’s drains and forced it into some brogues like Davros fell out of his Dalek like a rushed cartoon of a horny snail – is somehow not the worst person in cabinet, or even his own marriage. Against pushback from Sajid Javid and Priti Patel, Dominic Raab is attempting to get up to 60 British children back from camps in northern Syria before they freeze to death over the winter. That Raab, the flesh suit of a sentient virus with a forehead vein like a B\u0026ampB kettle-cord, is somehow the moral heart of this enterprise tells you all you need to know. In all likelihood, you’ll be praying that they prorogue the next parliament.Someone else who will still be here after the Rapture is the Brexit party’s Nigel Farage. I thought one of the advantages of the Brexit vote was that he might disappear having him back in public life is a bit like watching a suicide bomber doing a comeback tour. Of course, it would have been nice to see him actually running in the election, particularly from a pack of wild dogs. As for the Lib Dems – well, I thought we’d really miss Tim Farron, bumping around the country on a deserted coach and performing Blue Peter tasks in front of people terrified that he might start talking about gay sex. Jo Swinson has grown on me, and seems to exist as a satisfying, subtle and damning satire of humanity. Swinson’s election started out relatively positively, possibly because people hadn’t heard her speak yet. It quickly became clear that she had the gravitas of a re-education camp supply teacher, and was launching a kind of charm retreat that seemed to involve loans for renting flats and permanent austerity. Some might see misogyny in this reaction to her, but I’m fairly sure I just hate her for being from Milngavie.Labour’s idea to run an election campaign on policy in the middle of all this is a little bit like reciting your poetry at an orgy. Jeremy Corbyn, perhaps weighing up whether he could have more influence by simply dying and haunting his successor, has benefitted from becoming slightly calmer over the course of the campaign. Aggression isn’t a good look for him, shifting Corbyn from Rabbit in Winnie the Pooh towards the territory where you’d expect his face to be captioned with “police suspect the real figure may be much higher”. Labour’s campaign initially struggled to find the right note of warmth or optimism. Normally in a general election, there’s so little mention of Scotland it’s like watching coverage of a major football tournament, but Labour seemed pointlessly determined to get across the message that they would deny a second independence referendum. The Corbyn project started out as a piece of moralising – a token candidate standing in a Labour leadership election to remind the party of its principles – and his Labour is at its weakest when these roots show: it can come across as patronising and entitled. I think Labour presents itself better during elections because it is forced to be more practical. The whole Corbyn thing, at its best, is a sort of Ealing comedy about some old bloke who gets called off his allotment to try to form a government, but it needs to promise a third act where something actually happens. Labour’s campaign also demonstrates the limits of social media compared with establishment media power. If polls at the time of writing are to be believed, owning several TV stations and newspapers still seems to be more important than the democratisation of the ability to troll celebrity Jews.Before the campaign, there seemed to be a belief among Labour party members that it fared better in elections because of rules about electoral media balance, perhaps because they misconstrued the establishment complacency at the last election. Of course, Labour has been monstered in the media throughout the campaign, and largely been judged by different standards than the Conservatives. Even the gold standard of scrutiny that Johnson dodged was just being interviewed by his former boss at the Spectator.Media plurality is an issue we need to address in this country: the alternative is living in a timeline where, because Corbyn has wonky glasses, in a couple of years you’ll be living in a tent city outside an Amazon warehouse trying to GoFund a tonsillectomy. The Tories calling Corbyn a communist and a threat to national security after handing nuclear power plants to the Chinese is a bit like getting a bollocking off Charles Manson for putting down slug pellets. Perhaps in a few years our troops will reflect on what a harmless enemy Corbyn actually was, as they stare up at an AI minotaur, pinning them to the floor with a stainless steel hoof and holding their extracted vascular system aloft like a Ford Focus wiring-loom.You won’t be surprised to learn that I won’t be voting Tory on Thursday, for much the same reasons that I won’t be spending the day kicking children and pensioners into traffic. It’s depressing to think how many polling stations are in schools, and how many people will vote Conservative after walking past a motivational rainbow. As we saw in Stanley Johnson’s Pinocchio gaffe, there is a problem with our elites programming their traumatised children with the idea that they are born to rule. It becomes almost impossible, as a class, to hide your contempt. It’s difficult to keep lying convincingly about things you’ve convinced yourself your audience are too stupid to notice. This current iteration of Conservatism, a kind of mutant nationalism that insists all our infrastructure has to be owned by other countries, has nowhere to go but into an asset-stripped, deregulated wasteland. I don’t know how anyone votes for that, or what happens after they do. British people don’t get on well enough to form militia.I don’t want to end on a note of pessimism. Instead, I’d like to share with you my two favourite quotes. The first, is a really famous one. Kurt Vonnegut asked his adult son what he thought the meaning of life was, and his son replied: “We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.” The second is what David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, said about the ending of the final episode:“Well, what Tony should have been thinking, I guess, and what we all should be thinking – although we can’t live that way – is that life is really short. And there are good times in it and there are bad times in it. And that we don’t know why we’re here, but we do know that 20 miles up it’s freezing cold, it’s a freezing cold universe, but here we have this thing called love, which is our only defence, really, against all that cold, and that it’s a very brief interval and that, when it’s over, I think you’re probably always blindsided by it.”Twenty miles up, it’s a freezing cold universe, we only have the human connections we make here, nothing is permanent, and love is our only defence. I suggest we all vote accordingly, and try to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ee71254ce1020b694dbb26125a6d4203937d405/0_161_2934_1760/master/2934.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9a203e3190bb61225588bf0ddecd805","title":"tactical voting guide 2019 keep tories out remain voter general election","story":"One of Britain’s leading pollsters identifies the best choices for Remain voters at key general election battlegroundsOn current trends, voters will deliver a contradictory verdict on Thursday night. The Conservatives are on course for an overall majority in parliament – but most voters will back parties that want to block an early Brexit. If turnout is similar to last time, the 14 to 15 million who will support the Conservatives or Brexit party will be outnumbered by the 16 to 17 million who will vote Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green, SNP or Plaid Cymru.Tactical voting is not new, but it has a special significance this week. If it happens in enough constituencies, it can ensure that the two-million majority opposed to Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan is reflected in the new House of Commons.The map below shows 50 seats where tactical voting could keep the Conservatives out. Most tactical voting websites draw on one or two sets of polling data, which risk ignoring the specific circumstances of inidual constituencies. The guide draws on a wider range of information – detailed big-sample national polls, but also constituency surveys (including those reported week by week in the Observer), past election results and local activity, such as the recent student registration drives in some key seats (one is Brunel University, in Johnson’s own constituency, Uxbridge).However, without tactical voting, these three seats – like many others – may well return pro-Brexit MPs, despite having clear Remain majorities, because of the way the anti-Conservative vote ides.It should be stressed that there are many other marginals where Labour is the clear challenger to the Conservatives, but in almost all of these seats the Lib Dems are out of the running. There is little need here for a tactical guide to recommend Labour.In general, where the incumbent MP is Labour, they are the best placed to keep out the Tories. Our map shows five exceptions: three in Scotland and one each in England and Wales. Here, without tactical support for the best-placed non-Labour candidate, Conservative gains are a real possibility. However, in two three-way marginals, Labour needs to win over local supporters of the Lib Dems (Portsmouth South) and Plaid Cymru (Ynys Môn) to be sure of defeating the Conservatives.Scotland presents a specific challenge.

joshua goes distance win world titles andy ruiz jr points unanimous decision boxing","story":"• British boxer wins on points after much-improved performance• ‘I had to decapitate him in a different way,’ Joshua says of RuizOn a night when a storm raged across the Saudi Arabian desert Anthony Joshua becalmed the Mexican tempest in front of him to make history – and a whole lot of money – by regaining his WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight titles.But after his wide points victory over Andy Ruiz Jr, Joshua risked more controversy after being criticised by human rights groups last week by using the word “decapitate” when talking to the US broadcaster DAZN in a post-fight press conference.“I know that my fans like to see me knock people out and I can do that but sometimes with certain fighters you have to box smarter,” said Joshua. “I understand what Andy brought to the table so I had to decapitate him in a different way.”The fight itself was far from a classic. But Joshua’s cute transformation from gunslinger to boxer was effective enough to befuddle and neutralise Ruiz. Two judges had it 118-110, which felt about right, with a third scoring it 119-109.It means that Joshua becomes only the fourth man in the 127-year history of the world heavyweight title to successfully regain their title in a direct rematch, from the 10 fighters who attempted it: Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali and Lennox Lewis are the others. That is the company the Briton now keeps – although he will have to kick on smartly to get anywhere near Ali and Lewis in the pantheon.“I can box, I can really box but I like to fight,” Joshua said afterwards. “I’m a warrior at heart. When you are used to knocking a man out, sometimes it may happen to you. I knew I would correct my wrongs. I’m a man who learns from his mistakes.”He certainly did. When Ruiz ripped the belts from Joshua’s grasp in New York in June he disrupted one of boxing’s most indomitable laws –that a good big fighter usually beats a good smaller one – by stopping Joshua in seven. This time around the natural order reasserted itself as the Briton used an eight-inch reach advantage and better side-to-side movement to keep his opponent off balance.“Man, the first time was so nice, I had to do it twice!” added Joshua. “A man like me makes no excuses. This is about boxing. I’m used to knocking guys out. I got caught last time, no excuses, I gave him the credit. I respect Andy and his trainer so much. I wanted to show the sweet science of this lovely sport.”It was hard to dispute any of that. But he was certainly helped by Ruiz, his belly sagging over his shorts, being every bit as ponderous as his 20st weight had advertised. As the final bell rang he beat his chest angrily and said “fight me”. But deep down he knew he had been outfoxed – and out-prepared.As the Mexican-American admitted afterwards: “I don’t think I prepared as good as I should have. The three months of partying affected me. I should have trained harder. I gained too much weight and I wasn’t able to throw my combinations.When asked why he didn’t train harder, Ruiz admitted: “There was a lot on my plate.” Food, no doubt.For much of the night the skies above Diriyah, on the outskirts of the Saudi capital Riyadh, were soot black as rain soaked the 15,000 spectators to the bone. The city usually gets less than 10cm of rainfall a year. Much of it seemed to come in one sustained burst.At one point, as the wind whipped around the open air arena and wobbled the giant screens above the ring, there were even some concerns that the fight might be in jeopardy. Fortunately the threat of electrical storms had dissipated by the time Joshua and Ruiz faced off, just after midnight here.Both men had shown plenty of respect for each other in the protracted buildup and the fight started cautiously, with Ruiz stalking his prey and the Briton on the back foot. But shortly before the end of the opening round a nasty right hand from Joshua suddenly bloodied his opponent above his left eye.The old Joshua might have scented blood and immediately gone for the kill. This time, however, he had clearly loosened his addiction to chaos. Instead he was content to dance on the outside and allow his jab attempt to dominate – although he did pick up a small cut himself over his right eye at the end of the second round.The pattern had been set. The Briton kept jabbing and moving from side to side. In truth it sometimes looked mechanical, like someone dancing in public for the first time, but with Ruiz so slow it kept working.Joshua usually prepares for a fight by spending hours each week pumping iron, developing a body with muscles that could turn heads on Venice beach. This time he came in at under 17st – his lightest weight for five years – in a bid to counter Ruiz’s speed.Sometimes, though there was a sense that the Briton was allowing Ruiz’s roughhouse tactics to get to him – and that he wanted to trade too much. In the eighth he paid the price as the Mexican-American landed with a good left hook followed by a right hand. But it was Ruiz, with his granite chin, who was still taking more big punches as the fight went into the championship rounds.The crowd, who had paid between £105 and £10,000 for tickets, certainly enjoyed it. And so, clearly, did Joshua. Earlier in the week he had been warned that he was being duped by a Saudi regime that was “sportswashing” its reputation. He will continue to face criticism from human rights groups. But with so much in the bank, and with three world titles back around his waist, he will hardly care."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d5c42a7f20a95d016afd323040a599bf1e32677/0_98_4218_2531/master/4218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31c641b369c711ed0dac412a18e15ad0","title":"munster saracens european champions cup match report","story":"The champions are not quite out, but that age-old chestnut about attentions turning to domestic matters might long ago have been applied to Saracens this season.

A resounding win next week at home to this same Munster outfit would keep them in touch at the top of Pool 4. What manner of line-up will welcome the Irishmen to that?Conditions deteriorated so much that the faithful here had to endure a scoreless second half. Munster relied on a first-half try by that most faithful of all the denizens around here, captain Peter O’Mahony, to secure the points. It was the bare minimum they required to maintain the challenge to Racing 92.Arno Botha was shown a red card at the death to spoil the night somewhat, for an elbow into the neck of Nick Tompkins as he carried into the latter’s tackle.

They insist they are taking the defence of their title seriously, but the impression that they feel they have more important battles to fight on the home front was reinforced by another less-than-full-strength selection. It is possible to get into trouble for not picking your best side in this competition. Saracens probably feel they can’t get into much more trouble than they already have, so will take the risk.All told, they did well to turn round to inherit the insistence of a vicious wind just those seven points behind. Any champion side, however staffed, can be guaranteed a feisty welcome in Limerick. This was no different – for 40 minutes anyway. What’s more, Munster, whose attack is now overseen by Stephen Larkham, are more than just the elemental force of yore.Keith Earls and Andrew Conway saw plenty of ball down either flank in the first half and had Saracens on the turn time and again. All the harder, then, to regroup and face the more traditional battering at close quarters that is never far away here. That sole try was illustrative, Earls worked clear by a beautiful flat pass from Rory Scannell, before Conor Murray sent O’Mahony crashing over in classic fashion for a 10-0 lead on the half-hour.Beyond that, Saracens’ defence, well organised whatever the personnel, held firm in the wind. A Ben Spencer penalty just before the break kept the visitors in touch.They were grateful for the wind at their backs in the second half, as a cold rain thickened into Munster faces. The second half degenerated accordingly. Both sides struggled to hold on to the ball or find their targets from hand or boot. Spencer hit the post with a penalty for the second time in the match, and players as fabled as Murray and Maro Itoje were flustered into mistakes.As if to rile the locals further by their disrespect, Mark McCall showed no compunction in introducing his bench, which really was raw, early in the final quarter while the match was still there to be won, or the bonus point lost. As the minutes ticked slowly on, it became clear that such a point was the sum total of the champions’ hope or ambition.The red card for Botha helped Saracens to a square inch of the moral high ground for once. But the boos that resounded around Thomond Park might just as easily have been for the quality of the rugby on this wet, grim night as for our favourite pantomime villains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03b33b41a3dff7b3b1a513a13d1d504fa76cf2ae/0_40_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fc0291f0abdaca573de2e9444453ae8","title":"haiti looks to revolutionary hero dessalines","story":"As conflict racks the nation and anger at a political scandal grows, Haitians are rallying to the country’s founding father more than 200 years after his assassinationOn the walls across Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, a stencilled image can be found. Depicting a figure in a Napoleonic-era cocked hat and military frock coat, it first emerged amid the country’s long-running political and security crisis that began last year.The man portrayed is Jean-Jacques Dessalines – Emperor Jacques I of Haiti – the rebel general who defeated French forces at the battle of Vertières to found the state of Haiti in 1804. And it is not only in graffiti that Dessalines’s two centuries-old legacy has been seen in the recent months of political turmoil that has gripped the country.At the mass street protests that have flared intermittently throughout this year against the government of president Jovenel Moïse, roiled by allegations of a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal, Haitians have appeared in the streets dressed as Dessalines – not least during the huge demonstrations on 17 October that coincided with the national day marking the anniversary of his assassination in 1806.That commemoration saw Moïse forced to mark the usually public events at the National Pantheon Museum in private as hundreds of armed police officers closed down the surrounding area. Protesters demanding his resignation were gathered nearby.But above all, it is in the national conversation around the continuing crisis that the spirit of Dessalines has been most starkly in evidence.In the almost endless and sometimes heated exchanges on the country’s news and talk radio stations, discussion will inevitably turn to the modèle Dessalines – the ideal Dessalines model – a nostalgic idea of the different path Haiti might have taken but for his assassination.The reality is that the current evocation of Dessalines is one that speaks to Haiti’s myriad social woes and is a powerful critique of the failure of its political system over generations and centuries through dictatorship, chronic inequality and grinding poverty.And the intractability of Haiti’s current crisis – which has rumbled on since Moïse’s contested election two years ago – appears custom-made for an appeal to an almost mythological figure amid widespread popular distrust of the political elite.Implicated in the loss of about $2bn to corruption in a controversial scheme to buy cheap energy on credit from Venezuela, a deal that would free up funds for social development, the security forces in Moïse’s government have responded by firing on demonstrators, even as he has refused repeatedly to resign.Opposition figures, too, have been implicated in political violence, often involving the arming of criminal gangs, some touched by the same scandal as Moïse. All of this has elevated the status of a figure from the distant past who appears untainted by the current failure of Haiti’s political system.Sitting on the lawn of a cultural centre in Port-au-Prince’s Delmas neighbourhood, Lyonel Trouillot, one of Haiti’s most celebrated novelists, considers the importance of Dessalines – not least in comparison with Toussaint Louverture, the anti-colonial leader who is far better known elsewhere in the world through his depiction in CLR James’s 1938 account of rebellion in Haiti, The Black Jacobins.“For Haitians, Dessalines is practically the only figure in our history who has attained this mystical status,” he says. As he points out, Dessalines’ standing is such that he is the only figure to have been incorporated into the vodou pantheon as Ogou Desalin, a warrior associated with defending liberty.“He was a slave from the fields originally. And he was the leader who founded the state. He wanted a society that was based on equality and a common sphere of citizenship.”“The modèle Dessalines was the idea of a country for all of us, based on a common destiny in which everyone had the same chance. The murder of Dessalines in 1806 put an end to that process,” says Trouillot.“Since then,” he adds, “there has been an informal alliance between the mulatto bourgeoisie and those occupying political power.“The meaning of Dessalines in the current context is the desire in Haitian society for a new beginning. That’s what people in the streets are fighting for. It is a response to domination, exploitation and exclusion.”And Dessalines has meant very different things at different times.He was written out of Haiti’s history for four decades after his murder amid the country’s early diplomatic isolation. For its centenary in 1904, however, an anthem commemorating him was commissioned, La Dessalinienne, popularised during the two decades of US occupation that began in 1915.The close association with the Duvaliers’ rule (1957-1986) was followed by another period when Dessalines and his red-and-black flag became seen as difficult. Anyone flying the flag was suspected of supporting the former dictatorship. And Dessalines, the historical figure, as historians point out, is not without problems. He ordered the massacre of between 1,000 and 5,000 French citizens, including women and children in the “Haiti massacre” – prompted by fears of a French plot against the new republic – although he notably protected other non-French white people living in Haiti.And while Dessalines abolished slavery, he supported a restrictive labour system that tied workers to plantations even if they were paid for their efforts.Julia Gaffield, an academic at Georgia State University who is writing a book on Dessalines, sees appeals to his memory in Haitian politics as a reaction to both anxiety over the country’s sovereignty, faced with perceptions of foreign interference including from the US, and in appeals to a fairer society.“When the memory and legacy of Dessalines is called upon it is to serve contemporary needs, often when a very radical shift happens. When a revolution needs to happen. When there needs to be a complete overhaul of the system.”In his home, high in the hills above Port-au-Prince, the Haitian historian Pierre Buteau cautions against elevating the myth of Dessalines above the reality of a complex historical figure.“Every time we have difficulties,” he explains, “Haitians think of Dessalines. During the period of the US occupation. During the Aristides era. Now in the 21st century that emotion is becoming stronger and more intense amid all the political battles.“I think what is surprising for us as historians is how the myth has become mixed with the truth.” He adds that the problem confronting Jovenel Moïse is that he cannot talk about or ally himself with the historical figure because he is viewed as having abandoned many of the things Dessalines stood for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c0e654f51a5ea3263ffd98c60697ada143d9fb6/0_254_5072_3044/master/5072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c263e8b16e1a3c75d04f56ebe8c06872","title":"amexica revisited ed vulliamy returns to us mexico borderline","story":"If you drink the water in Ciudad Juárez, there you’ll stay, goes the saying – Se toma agua de Juárez, allí se queda. It’s not a reference to the quality of drinking water (about which polemic abounds because it is so dirty) but to the beguiling lure of this dusty and dangerous yet strong and charismatic city. It’s a dictum that might be applied to the whole 2,000-mile Mexico-US borderland of which Juárez and its sister city on the US side, El Paso, form the fulcrum.Ten years ago, I returned from several months’ immersion along that frontier, reporting on a narco-cartel war for this newspaper and eventually writing a book, Amexica, about the terrain astride the border, land that has a single identity – that belongs to both countries and yet to neither. A frontier at once porous and harsh: across which communities live and a million people traverse every day, legally, as do hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of goods annually.In the past 10 years I’ve returned scores of times and even lived there for a while, but now the border crisis is so urgent – with regard to narco-traffic and migration – that I felt I needed to go back and revisit voices and themes, try to measure what has changed and what has not since I wrote the book. Amexica + 10, if you like. This is now a frontier on which US president Donald Trump fixates, pledging a wall to run its length as a rampart against an “invasion”. Thousands die or disappear trying to cross it, desperate migrants gather on its southern side, with dreams and illusions of America, only to be incarcerated, separated from family and deported when they get there.What were lonely desert byways 10 years ago now host traffic jams of reporters and TV crews, as the border becomes a place of humanitarian disaster, main mast of Trump’s re-election campaign. Back then, you had to explain who and what Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán and his Sinaloa cartel were. Since that time, we’ve had TV series Narcos ad nauseam, the films Sicario 1 and 2, some wonderful journalism and El Chapo’s trial-as-theatre in New York.Ten years ago, the story along the borderline was narco-traffic, to which the theme of migration played an accompanying role, as the cartels moved in on human trafficking. Now the world is on the move, and much of it has converged on “Amexica”. While 10 years ago, most migrants at the border were in flight from violence and poverty in Mexico, now thousands flee gangland violence in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras in Ciudad Juárez, a “little Havana” of waiting Cubans is established they come from eastern Europe and Asia Haitians arrive in Tijuana migrants gather in Ciudad Acuña from the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa.A decade ago, the administration of Barack Obama began a clampdown on criminal immigrants, and accelerated deportations to record levels. Now, Trump has shocked his own country, collided with federal courts and outraged the world with policies separating children from parents, appalling conditions of incarceration, wholesale roundups of immigrants without papers – or criminal records – and the sending back ofasylum seekers to “remain in Mexico” (rather than wait for their initial hearings in the country where asylum has been claimed as per international law).But drug violence, cartels and their conviviality with government are perennial and ubiquitous. Amexica was published after the government of Felipe Calderón declared war on the cartels in late 2006, after which murder rates hit the highest since the Mexican revolution, and Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world. Homicides then waned, only to spike again now: last year was the bloodiest yet in Mexico, and 2019 is set to overtake it, with the government last week counting 29,574 reported homicides to the end of October.Ten years ago, the task was to report how Guzmán’s Sinaloa cartel supplanted rivals along the border west of Juárez, for export mainly of cocaine then downriver, less successfully, confronting the Zetas and Gulf cartels in Coahuila and Tamaulipas. Now, with Guzmán jailed and his cartel fragmented, the plaza – the drug traffic turf – is unquiet again, as the Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación stakes its claim, trafficking mainly in synthetic drugs and fentanyl to fill a vacuum left by the clawback on prescribed opioids in the US. Violence increases when the plates shift, and while it used to be worst along the border, now – though Tijuana is Mexico’s, and the world’s, murder capital – killing is across the country, through Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero and Veracruz in particular.What happens along this frontier is a prism through which to examine a world where the illicit economy bleeds into the supposedly legal one, to render the border between them a sieve like the physical border itself, as high street banks launder profits of drug traffic with impunity. Amexica ended with the story of the Wachovia bank moving $378bn from Mexico, much of it from the Sinaloa cartel, without adequate checks. HSBC, too, was caught moving El Chapo’s money. No one from either bank has been arrested, let alone jailed. Following Guzmán’s conviction, US government forfeiture of his alleged $14bn value is all “back in Mexico” – money sent to be laundered south of the border – the small change none of the hundreds of billions sent into the “legal” economy by Wachovia or HSBC are in their sights. I call it the lie of legality.And so, in what is supposed to be peacetime, a new kind of 21st-century war rages across this enthralling country. The official number of homicides in Mexico since 2007 – 307,624, excluding the disappeared, until October this year – stands at a level akin to that in some of the worst wars in recent history, yet effervescent Juárez is not like, say, besieged Sarajevo. Part of my book’s aim was to describe unspeakable violence in places where life goes on and daily encounters were generally a delight. This does not change: in no place I know are the ready smile, the unnecessary chat, the twinkle-in-the-eye so pervasive. Uber works fine, people go to mass and to market, shopping centres open, burritos and pastries are delicious, restaurants full again. “It looks normal,” says Julián Cardona, who took the photographs in Juárez for this article, “but it’s not.”Cardona has coined the term “urban Frankenstein” to describe his adoptive city. Last January, the bodies of a family running a grocery in Juárez were discovered only after stray dogs found and started eating them. In Tijuana, I reported on the abduction and murder of two Honduran migrant boys – Jasson Ricardo Acuña and Jorge Alexander Ruíz – and the testimony of a third, who survived and led police to the scene. José Alberto Álavarez, Tijuana’s district attorney, showed me photographs of the victims, aged 16 and 17: “I fear to note that one of the deceased was dressed in women’s clothes,” he says, showing a lifeless body, bloodied and strangled, wearing a brassiere and red skirt. “Not only that, but when the survivor took us to the house, one of the killers was still wearing the clothes and shoes of the deceased. Two days later. That’s what we’re dealing with.”First stirrings precede first light in the Chihuahua desert, beyond the frayed edges of Juárez. Mumbling, moaning, crashing of pans heating coffee and the odd scream, at Visión En Acción rehabilitation centre, or “rescue asylum”. As the sun’s fiery rays break over the scrub, residents emerge from their sleeping quarters around a courtyard, deranged but dutifully carrying soiled blankets to be bleached in the heat. Rafael heaves his pungent load, saying first that he was a missionary from Veracruz, but then again, he was a dealer from Juárez actually, he’s a millionaire from Zacatecas – he’s not sure.This sanctuary for the abandoned mentally ill and other vulnerable people has been run for 24 years by pastor José Antonio Galván, who joked 10 years ago that the city out there – full of yonkes, junkyards of cars totalled in America, refitted for the road – was actually a “human junkyard”, while this was “a haven of peace”. Which it is, in a way: where recovering addicts, penitent cartel sicarios (hitmen) and their mistresses, psychos, street dealers and those discarded by the city’s assembly plant economy are refitted for life. Last time I was here, I spent a few nights sharing quarters with a man called Josué, who told me he had been “dead when I got here”, from street-gang life in Los Angeles and heroin in Juárez. Today, all that remains of him here is his degree certificate, framed on the pastor’s wall – Josué is now a practising nurse.Galván still looks like the teddy boy he once was – in a purple paisley jacket that seems, and doesn’t seem, out of place here – and greets me with the poised fists of the boxer he also was. “The Lord is on my side,” he says, punching the air. I feel 10 years older, I tell him, yet he seems younger. “Have passion, have faith, have life,” he laughs. “These are my people, under my wing. I feel part of this desert now, like a lizard – you’ve got to look carefully, know what you’re doing and move fast.” Threats from cartels and gangs seeking out patients to enact vengeance have eased, he reports, but “they never go away”.An estimated 40,000 people have disappeared since 2006 in Mexico – one of the most outrageous aspects of this war – and some are found by Peludo, the centre’s pet dog. “He keeps finding legs, then a head, different bodies in different places, of people who have been kidnapped and disappeared in the desert,” says Galván. “Sometimes when it rains, bodies surface, and come floating.”In the yard, “his people” greet Galván, hugging his waist while he pats their matted hair, strokes their scars, each precious to him. Things change, and they don’t. Becky, former pole dancer and crackhead, is dead now, as is big Oscar, former sicario for the Barrio Azteca gang, street affiliate of the old Juárez cartel. But Yogi is still here, shaven-headed 10 years ago, now sporting a jester’s hat. He has Down’s syndrome and schizophrenia.There’s been impressive building work in recent years what were timeworn breeze-blocks are now whitewashed walls there’s air conditioning, even a TV area for telenovelas and baseball. Across the patio, the mazed eyes, mind-sickness, and poignant affection between Galván and what he calls “my family”, echo down 10 years on different faces. The drugs, too, are different, says Galván – “We’re seeing less crack, more crystal meth, and synthetics” – but their ravages are the same. The shelter’s nurse, Imelda Castro, explains that it takes “a balance between miracles and medication”.The place is staffed, as it always has been, by former patients, and Galván feels that the story of his last decade can best be told through their example they are disarmingly open about where they’ve come from.When Vera, the accountant at the centre, arrived four years ago, she was “completely wild”, says Galván. Born to a middle-class family in Guanajuato, Vera had “entered a life of prostitution and pole dancing – pregnant at 15,” she says. “I attracted bad people: narcos, sicarios, jefes…” Before long, she was one of them, selling and moving drugs for the Knights Templar cartel.“I saw everything: murder, kidnappings. So much violence, so many drugs, so much sex, you don’t see it for what it is. I admired the power of these people, and respected their authority.” But such proximity was also dangerous, as the Knights were overrun by the Jalisco Nueva Generación: “They kill women because they have so much information the favoured women know everything.”After a disastrous relationship, Vera attempted suicide, but was rescued by her parents and placed in a psychiatric hospital. Her parents sold their house to pay for treatment at a shelter and finally Vera arrived at Visión En Acción.That must have been difficult in the case of Neor (not his real name), host for my overnight stay. He had had a “bad life” with his father “taking drugs, whipping us all – no money, no food”. Neor started on crystal, crack and solvents at the age of 12, then started “robbing and killing for money”, and inevitably did so for a major cartel. “I was a sicario,” he says.“Once you’ve killed the first time, it gets easy – I was taking so much crystal, I could handle it.”Then one day the time came for him to kill a man who had been given the task of selling a large amount of meth, but had kept and spent the money. “It was a big hit. For some reason I didn’t want to do it, but they said if I didn’t, they’d kill me.” After a shootout at his house – “I took a bullet in the leg”, Neor shows me the scar – he escaped and went on the run. He had heard about a former drug dealer now working at Visión En Acción, and was brought here. How long ago? He beams: “Four months ago.”“I’m strict,” says Galván, “afraid of nothing.” One recent morning, though, Neor found himself out on the highway, planning to return to Guanajuato. “I started shaking,” he says, “and a voice in me said: ‘Don’t. Go back to work’.” “There’s a devil waiting to lure them back any time,” says Galván, “and I gotta beat that devil up.” I had for a moment forgotten that the pastor himself was once an addict on the street. “I learned that,” he says, “when I was living among the trash cans – when I was one of them.”On a rainy September morning in Tijuana, at the border’s western edge, an ostentatious but imposing ceremony was arranged: an incineración de droga by combined law enforcement agencies, where they set fire to 26,000 kilos of heroin, cocaine, crystal meth and other drugs. A torch is applied, flame spreads across the hillock of drugs, black smoke billows skywards – and a platoon of agents from the Agencia de Investigación Criminal line up for a team photo against the backdrop of the inferno. It’s been a while since this was done publicly here, but everyone knows it won’t be the last time, and that – gallant though the choreography is – this pyre represents but a grain among millions, on the move, out there.My journey through Amexica 10 years ago began and ended here when Tijuana was second only to Juárez in its murder rate. Last year, a report by the Citizens’ Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice, which measures homicides per capita, found six of the world’s 10 most murderous cities to be in Mexico, and Tijuana top of the list.The epilogue to my book was an interview with Antonio Irán “Hiram” Muñoz, whose macabre expertise at the prosecutor’s office was to analyse the mutilations of cartel victims to decode any messages they might contain – he called it “necropsia” rather than “autopsia”: severed feet or toes if someone walked from a cartel, the sliced tongue of a snitch. A forensic expert, but also a philosopher, Muñoz was furious at how few prosecutions resulted from his work.We meet now at the Ateneo de Ciencias Universitarias y Artes. Muñoz himself founded this college “to train young people to blend the ‘criminalistic’ – what is found at a crime scene, scientifically – and the ‘criminological’, which is psychological, why the criminal did what he did”, he says. “Ten years ago, we talked about terrible things happening in this city. But I was failing to change things at the prosecutor’s office, so decided to create my own university and impart what I knew to the next generation.This change has come about because Mexico’s domestic drug market – the so-called narcomenudeo – has increased further since Amexica and is now believed to account for even more violence than that caused by competition for “export” plazas. “The drugs don’t just fly to the north,” says Muñoz, “they also stay here, so that now there’s a war for the streets here – and this contributes to the general collapse. There is no message to send now: I just erase you from the point of sale. Kill one, and I have four more waiting to replace you.”Muñoz notes the arrival of fentanyl on the domestic and export markets: “It’s cheap to make and easy to smuggle. I also come across it in my forensic investigations – more deaths from fentanyl, often mixed with cocaine, without the addict knowing. Dealers cut other drugs with fentanyl to make them even more addictive.“Human beings are addicts, addicts of pleasure and power – coffee, alcohol, sex, extreme sports – and drugs are the most addictive of all. It’s never going to go away, and what makes this war pure stupidity is that we are never going to win it unless we see the addict as a sick person, not a criminal.”The road bends, along stretches of new fence, to the river’s end, where the twin towns of Brownsville and Matamoros, one of six bi-national metropolitan border areas, face one another. A decade ago, Michael Seifert had recently left the priesthood at his parish of San Felipe de Jesús in Cameron Park, Brownsville, fallen in love with a paediatrician and married her. But he continued to work for the community in a post-pastoral role, until this poorest, entirely Hiic, quarter of town became the last to be “incorporated”, with running water and electricity in almost every home. Still devout, but a radical theologian, Seifert posited 10 years ago that the Virgin of Guadalupe portrays a dancing Madonna, pregnant with the mestizo Mexican race – mixed because it was the product of rape by Spanish conquistadors. We meet again: “I had Mexican seminarians walk out on me for that,” he says with a smile. “She’s supposed to be immaculate.”Seifert remains “plugged in to Cameron Park, all the better to keep people connected”, but has adapted his work to the migration crisis, for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), with an “integrated advocacy” team guiding migrants as they cross from Matamoros into Brownsville in the US, and writing regular internet reports entitled Views from Alongside a Border.“These people came here,” he says, “because they wanted to be safe. Yet over in Matamoros, they are prey to deadly criminals, and here they are met with a system carefully designed to fail them. They can have no idea of the evil genius of our immigration and asylum apparatus, satanic in its cleverness in keeping them out, and in danger.”In January 2019, despite an outcry over child separation, the Trump administration introduced “Migrant Protection Protocols”, whereby asylum seekers, rather than wait for their “credible fear” interview in the US (as per the 1939 Montevideo treaty on political asylum), are sent back to wait in Mexico. The Mexican government of leftwing president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has given full support, earning compliments from Trump for “spectacular” results: some 58,000 asylum seekers are now reported returned to, and waiting in, Mexico.Immigration courts on the US side are perfunctory and dysfunctional. I was forbidden entry to the huge tent – or “soft-sided facility” as the government calls it – erected on the Brownsville side of the river to hear pleas by video link. But I did visit two courts dealing with detained migrants at nearby McAllen and Port Isabel: rows of shackled, confused, weary people hustled through production-line “justice”, with, in some cases, no more exchange with the bench than a nod to indicate understanding of their “rights”, before deportation.Beside the Gateway bridge connecting Matamoros to downtown Brownsville, across a few yards of river and reed bank, is a tent city of around 1,000 people, encamped for safety in numbers, mostly “waiting in Mexico” for the date on their crumpled but clasped Notice to Appear given to them before they were sent back under Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy. A higher proportion are returned to Matamoros than anywhere else on the border, for all the dangers.My book Amexica ended with the story of the massacre of 72 migrants at San Fernando, Tamaulipas, in 2010. Migrant massacres and disappearances have become increasingly common. On Christmas Eve 2011, 15 migrants were dragged from a diocesan shelter in Matamoros, and never seen again scores of disappearances have followed. Staff at the bus station have witnessed, on many occasions, the macabre arrival of baggage belonging to migrants on board coaches from the interior, with no one to claim them. In Nuevo Laredo last month, Aarón Méndez, manager of a Presbyterian shelter, was abducted after refusing to hand over those in his care to a unit of gunmen. Ten years ago, Sandra Rodríguez was mourning the loss of her colleague on Juárez’s daily newspaper, El Diario. Armando Rodríguez was shot dead in his car as he prepared to take his daughter to school in November 2008. Sandra Rodríguez took the same risks, wrote the same kind of stories for which her friend died. She was preoccupied by what she called “the culture of impunity in this city, from its very design, to the way the economy works from the street to the top”. She published an important book of reportage from the city in 2012, La Fábrica del Crimen (The Crime Factory), which was published in English as The Story of Vicente, Who Murdered His Mother, His Father and His Sister, which he did.Rather than write about capos and sicarios, Rodríguez’s subject is the brutalisation of Mexican society. Vicente did what he did, he said, “porque puedo”, because I can.Over the past decade, Rodríguez reflects, “the story of Mexico is as Vicente predicted: you can do whatever you want, with impunity. You can kill whoever you want, kill in broad daylight, kill a journalist, disappear 43 students – and get away with it. Vicente has become a metaphor for the whole country.”As news editor, Rodríguez faces a dilemma. “We have a picture,” she says, “of two people walking past a corpse, and they don’t even glance at it – this is Juárez after 10 years. I want it on the front page, but my editor says: we don’t have a story to go with this, and he’s right. Or we have a 16-year-old killed, without a birth certificate or school record. Again, this should be front-page news. But it’s not: people being killed is no longer news in Juárez, or the rest of Mexico – killing has become normal and crime has become a habit.”Rodríguez has since lost another friend, Miroslava Breach, an investigative journalist from her home town of Chiuhuahua, murdered in 2017 when leaving home, like Armando. Twelve journalists have been killed in Mexico so far this year, so that – according to a report on US National Public Radio last month, Mexico has overtaken Syria as the most dangerous country in the world for journalists. On the day I crossed from El Paso to Juárez this time, a correspondent from National Geographic was shot and wounded.“It’s outrageous,” says Rodríguez. “It comes from the same disease, impunity. They do it because they know they can, to silence the press.” And yet, for all this, when a friend in our company asks: “Have you ever been really happy?” Rodríguez does not hesitate: “Yes, my city makes me happy. I love Juárez it kills people, but gives me life.”Kill it certainly does. The culture of impunity, says Rodríguez, has its roots in the 90s, “with the killing of 300 women in this city, when we realised nothing would happen to the killers”. The so-called “Femicidio” brought Juárez to the attention of the world, and me back to the city in 1999. The misogynist “style” of killing – a word used “not lightly” by anthropologist Cecilia Ballí in Amexica – seemed to take the violence to another level. In her thesis, Ballí explored this “sexual murder” in the light of a “hypermasculinity in US-Mexico border zones, informed by the history, style and logic of militarisation and organised crime”.Among the mothers who suffered unfathomable grief at the abduction, violation and murder of a daughter was Paula Flores, the body of whose 17-year-old daughter Maria Sagrario González was found dumped in the desert in April 1998. She had disappeared after leaving home early to take a bus to work in one of Juárez’s hundreds of maquiladora assembly plants, bedrock of the city’s economy. My chapter on the Femicidio opened with Paula imploring the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which Sagrario wore around her neck: “Where were you when they did this to my little girl?”Flores’s face has changed remarkably little since I last saw her 10 years ago, or indeed since I first interviewed her in 1999 and again in 2002. It carries that same wounded but indomitable fortitude. She lives in the same house, attached to the family’s grocery store at the top of the Anapra barrio, a quarter called Lomas de Poleo, on the north-western outskirts of town, right against the border. An old, repainted American school bus grinds up the dusty slope, with the mountains behind El Paso as backdrop.“Time passes,” Flores says. “It’s been 21 years now and everything is the same – nothing has happened. We are marked for life, and will remain so while there is no reckoning with what happened. There can be no recovery. And it continues: women keep disappearing, keep being murdered.”On the other hand, “I have my store, and my family. At weekends we are all together, all from Durango, though my grandchildren were born here. Eleven of them now, some of the age Maria Sagrario was, and that can be traumatic.”In 2005, a man called José Luis Hernández was jailed for the murder of Maria Sagrario – sentenced for 28 years. “But I fear he will be out much sooner,” says Flores. That is not the end of the matter: “He said he was paid $800 to be part of this. But by whom? Who else was involved, and why? We have always said that everything rests with the authorities, that the authorities were complicit in the murder of women in Juárez.“Every year, on the anniversary – 16 April – we get together and repaint the crosses,” says Flores – they are black on a pink background, painted or placed on walls, lamp-posts and public spaces around the city. In 2012, the mayor of Juárez, Hector Murguía, announced he would ban this practice and “apply the law” on defacement of public space. “He threatened us, but we did it,” says Flores, though “this year only four of us turned up.”The mothers of six murdered women, including Flores, filed a suit – Silvia Elena Rivera Morales et al vs Mexico – through the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, over the authorities’ abrogation of responsibility. A hearing was held in Washington DC on 29 September. “Though my daughter’s case is from 21 years ago,” Flores told the commission, “I still feel the same pain of my daughter not being here. She deserves justice.”“Yes,” she says now in her kitchen, “with the other mothers, we’re still pushing this. It was all very nice there in Washington, and the president of the court offered his sympathies. But they’ve had this case since 2007, and it’s a verdict we need, not sympathy. I don’t think they have any idea of the emotional toll, the pain involved.”Flores seems rightly exhausted with trying to find words for the unspeakable. Two of her other daughters arrive, and there’s a delicious lunch of spicy beans, cheese and tortillas, a portrait of Maria Sagrario staring down from the back wall. There’s discussion of music, grandchildren, climate crisis and life around the barrio. We’re done for today with what Edgar Allan Poe called “the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed”.But there’s one final question: where was the Virgin of Guadalupe when they did that? “I asked the same question to the cross on her coffin, and the virgin on her locket: why didn’t she protect her?” says Flores, “and I’ve asked it every day since, and I hear no answer. I still believe. But how can it be? Maria Sagrario was not against God she was a believer, she sang in church, and helped at Sunday school. During Lent that year, I prayed for the protection of my daughters. Three days later, Maria Sagrario disappeared.“I try to ask myself not so much ‘Why did she die?’ but ‘For what?’ Maybe for the school. Maybe so that with the help of the other mothers, I can raise awareness about what is happening here. So the world would take notice – maybe.”A 10th anniversary edition of Amexica by Ed Vulliamy will be published by Vintage books next year.To donate to Visión En Acción, visit visioninactionrescueasylum"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d972d6d61d4fa6c8742ba67644a8ca32d5fbca8/0_121_2397_1438/master/2397.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db75b98e2a7c343c5ff0c2b0665b4bb4","title":"china and taiwan offered us huge bribes say solomon islands mps","story":"Politicians say they were offered hundreds of thousands of dollars for their support before country switched diplomatic recognition to BeijingSolomon Islands politicians allege both China and Taiwan offered bribes of hundreds of thousands of dollars to gain their support during a diplomatic row that rocked the country earlier this year.In September the prime minister of the Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, formally severed ties with Taipei and established relations with Beijing, ending the country’s 36-year relationship with Taiwan.The decision had reverberations around the world, incensing US senators, outraging the Taiwanese, influencing Kiribati to also abandon Taiwan less than two weeks later, and causing headaches for Australia at a time when Beijing’s influence in the Pacific appears to be expanding. Now, just 15 countries recognise Taiwan.As part of an investigation of the inside story behind the diplomatic switch, the  can reveal that MPs allege they were approached by representatives from the Chinese and Taiwanese governments and offered hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for their support.The deputy leader of the opposition, Peter Kenilorea Jr, told the  that it was “an open secret that money is always involved in these things”, referring to MPs abandoning long-held pro-Taiwan positions to support Beijing.Kenilorea, who opposed the switch and labelled it a “slap in the face of the parliamentary process”, said he heard from MPs that were involved in the decision that they had been offered between SBD$2m-$5m ($246,000-$615,000) to support Beijing.Daniel Sudaini, the premier of Malaita, Solomon Islands’ largest province, alleges he was offered a bribe in exchange for softening his strong anti-Beijing position.“Before the switch was made… there is a group of people or maybe someone who called me on the phone to give me an offer so I can support the switch. But I decided not to because if I accept the offer I’m not representing the people.“They were offering an amount of money, telling me on the phone if you join us there’s a package here.”Sudaini, who said he rejected the offer, previously told the Solomon Star the bribe he was offered was SBD$1m ($123,000). His accusation is now the subject of a formal inquiry by the Solomon Islands’ police commissioner.In a statement, China’s foreign ministry said the establishment of diplomatic ties with the Solomon Islands had been an “open and above board” process.“No rumour or slander will affect the development of friendly relations between China and the Solomon Islands,” it said.Titus Fika, a government MP who chaired one inquiry that ended up recommending the government change its allegiance from Taiwan to China, denied that money influenced the decision of his committee. Instead, Fika accused Taiwan of trying to corrupt the process, saying he was offered a bribe from Taiwan to keep the status quo.“But it doesn’t work, because we don’t sign for it, because we want to do the right thing, not to for our own interest but for the country’s interest and our constituency interests.”In a statement to the , Taiwan rejected the accusations. “Under no circumstances will Taiwan resort to an ugly dollar diplomacy bidding war with China, much less line the pockets of corrupt politicians,” said Joanne Ou, a spokesperson for the ministry of foreign affairs.A 2017 report by Transparency International found the Solomon Islands to be “very corrupt” and said the situation “appears to be deteriorating”.Sogavare’s office declined multiple interview requests by the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf1a4e9f13184469ebc3cc424e15636b276ed8d8/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f58936a3f5cb23f171763acff350bb69","title":"emmanuel macron pension reforms winter of discontent","story":"With hardline unions threatening indefinite strikes over pension reforms, there is apprehension at the political perils facing Emmanuel MacronEmmanuel Macron will seek to placate angry strikers this week while honouring his election pledge to shake up France’s pension system in a delicate balancing act that will define his political future.Ministers are looking at possible concessions that could defuse the strikes and protests that have paralysed the country since last week.Transport chaos continued this weekend and unions have called for another day of industrial action on Tuesday, putting further pressure on the government.After last-minute consultations, the prime minister Édouard Philippe will give full details of the controversial changes to the country’s pension schemes at midday on Wednesday.As hardline union leaders vowed to continue striking indefinitely, there were warnings that the country was entering a dangerous period.Caroline Janvier, who entered parliament as one of Macron’s La République en Marche “citizen” MPs in the 2017 general election, denied the government was panicked but admitted it was “a moment of apprehension for everyone”.“Everyone in the country is still traumatised by the gilets jaunes (yellow vest protesters) and concerned the violence will start again,” she said. “Nobody wants a repeat of that.”Jean Grosset, director of the social dialogue observatory at the Jean-Jaurès Foundation, a left-wing think-tank, feared that if the government refused to compromise there would be long-term consequences. “If there’s a hardening of attitudes in France it could create a perilous situation,” he said. “It’s dangerous to have a social crisis because it results in people turning to more populist parties.”In the town of Joigny – 93 miles (150km) south-east of Paris in Yonne, the heart of the outer commuter belt around the French capital known as la France péripherique – the local railway station, like many in rural France, was deserted last Thursday. Notices announced that no trains would be stopping there.In nearby villages, school buses continued their rounds, carrying only a handful of pupils to classes not cancelled by striking teachers, as thick fog descended over icy fields.While schools and colleges are expected to be open again this week, nobody can predict when normal public transport services will be resumed. Rail workers have declared their strikes “renewable” on an open-ended daily basis.Last Friday Philippe pointed out that the government had been consulting union and business leaders over pensions changes for almost two years in an attempt to clear the way for an agreement. Instead, like the freezing fog in the Yonne, the talks had left people cold and apprehensive.On Friday, an Elysée spokesman told journalists the president was anxious to “dispel the fog” surrounding the pension issue, an aim not helped by contradictory statements from ministers.Macron made shaking up France’s arcane pension system a pillar of his 2017 presidential campaign. Now half-way through his five-year mandate, he has already faced down protests against his labour reforms and the overhaul of the state railway SNCF last year, and more than 12 months of gilets jaunes protests but pension reform is the hill on which his administration has chosen to go down in history – in ignomy or glory.Macron wants to replace France’s 42 pension schemes with a single “universal” points system that he argues will be fairer. At the heart of the dispute are the “special regimes” that afford certain public sector workers – including railway and other public transport staff – a number of acquis (rights) including early retirement and other benefits.Philippe said the new system would mean more equality between workers and would exchange “the solidarity with certain professions with a national solidarity”. “It will enable each French person to pay in the same way and benefit from the same rights,” he said.“France cannot accept in future these schemes that allow some to leave (work) earlier and with more than others.”Janvier admitted the government’s messages over pension reform had been confused and often contradictory, but said there was a determination to get the job done. “There’s a willingness to carry out this reform, but we know it will be complicated. We said we would reform and reform we will, but there has to be agreement.”She added: “The approach has to be collective and not conflictual and it needs time and reasonable solutions. It’s not something that can be delivered by forceps. But it has to be done.”Grosset agreed that the current pension system was unjust, but added: “The government wants the same system for everyone, and why not? But there are people who stand to lose – not just transport workers, but teachers and nurses too. Their concerns must be addressed. Mr Macron promised to reform pensions in his election manifesto, but he also promised there would be no losers.”He added the situation was unlike 1995, when plans to change France’s welfare and pensions systems brought two million people onto the streets in almost a month of protests against President Jacques Chirac and his prime minister, Alain Juppé. The reform was dropped.“In 1995, there wasn’t Marine Le Pen waiting in the wings,” Grosset said. “The ball is in the government’s court. It may succeed in forcing the reforms though but if there is no dialogue, no attempt to compromise, just force, it will leave traces of rancour in the country, which it will pay for one day or another and most likely through the ballot box.”France’s biggest union, the CFDT, is broadly open to the idea of a points-based system if it applies only to those joining the workforce after 2025. Some government officials have hinted this could be pushed back even further to 2035. The more hardline CGT and Force Ouvrière unions, which are stronger in the public sector, reject the reform wholesale and are preparing for a long fight.Daniel Ferté of the FO railway workers’ section said union members had the impression the government had “heard nothing” from last week’s protests.The hard left leader of La France Insoumise, Jean Melenchon, was also in a fighting mood: “People aren’t demanding to be billionaires, they want to retire from work and be able to live with good health and dignity. It’s really not that difficult.”On Friday Joigny station was still deserted and the normally packed commuter car park dotted with few vehicles. Jean, a retired wholesale executive, was on his way to buy bread. He had no idea how the pension issue would play out. “You want me to predict what will happen next week in France? Can you predict what will happen with Brexit?” he said. “No, me neither.”Attempting to reform France’s pension system has been likened to the job of poor Sisyphus, the mythical Greek king tasked with rolling an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down again when it neared the top.For the Socialists, President François Mitterrand lowered the retirement age from 65 to 60 when he took office in 1981.In 1995, President Jacques Chirac and his prime minister Alain Juppé tried to introduce a universal system and end the “special regimes” enjoyed by public sector workers. The attempt saw 2 million people take to the streets in almost a month protests. The reform was dropped.In 2010, President Nicolas Sarkozy raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, but only after a week of strikes, the blockading of oil refineries and nationwide protests.Emmanuel Macron’s predecessor, the Socialist François Hollande promised to tackle the deficit in the pensions system, but ended up shying away from major changes after tens of thousands protested in Paris."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8947d981e94dac4cd7d013821c7a97092c47af1c/0_114_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0431832b1e0c3e00eb015466f5f6df34","title":"iran unveils budget of resistance to sanctions with help from 5bn russian loan","story":"Iran’s president says his country will depend less on oil revenue in a budget designed to resist crippling US sanctionsIran’s president says his country will depend less on oil revenue next year, in a “budget of resistance” that will partly depend on a $5bn Russian loan.Speaking during Sunday’s opening session of parliament, Hassan Rouhani said: “The budget is based on maximum pressure and sanctions.“Next year, similar to the current year, our budget is a budget of resistance and perseverance against sanctions.

Past satellite launches have helped scuttle talks with the US.Missile experts said it appeared likely the North Koreans had conducted a static test of a rocket engine, rather than a missile launch.Ankit Panda, an adjunct senior fellow with the Federation of American Scientists, said on Twitter: “This is likely a ground-based engine test at the Sohae test stand. This is not a launch.” He added: “We’ve seen several indicators over the last few months suggesting that a space launch might be what they’re working up to.”KCNA reported: “The results of the recent important test will have an important effect on changing the strategic position of the DPRK once again in the near future.” Tensions have risen ahead of a year-end deadline set by North Korea, which has called on the US to change its policy of insisting on Pyongyang’s unilateral denuclearisation and demanded relief from punishing sanctions.Donald Trump told reporters in June 2018 after his first summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that North Korea had pledged to dismantle one of its missile installations, which US officials later identified as Sohae.Commercial satellite imagery captured on Thursday by Planet Labs showed new activity at the Sohae satellite launching station and the presence of a large shipping container, CNN reported, with analysts suggesting it indicated a test was imminent."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4108438.1575738025!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm atiyah parks and nature reserves to be closed on sunday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Storm Ophelia batters the Atlantic coast at Lahinch, Co Clare, in  October 2017.

File photograph: Aidan CrawleyEPAA number of public parks will be closed on Sunday due to expected strong winds and heavy rain from Storm Atiyah.The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht said it was advising members of the public not to visit any national parks, national monuments or nature reserves as a status orange weather warning was in place.The warning covers Counties Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Sligo, Clare, Kerry and Limerick from 9am on Sunday to 6am on Monday.The service said the following parks and reserves would be closed on Sunday:* Killarney House and Gardens, Co Kerry While the storm will remain quite far from Ireland’s north coast, people on the west coast are advised to take extra precautions on Sunday and into Monday morning, said Met Éireann forecaster Elizabeth Coleman. There is a possibility of coastal flooding due to a combination of high seas and storm surge.Yellow wind warningA yellow wind warning is set to come into place for the rest of the country from 3pm on Sunday to 6am on Monday, as winds reach mean speeds of 50 to 60 kmh with gusts of up to 100 kmh.The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) Severe Weather Team in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government said it has been monitoring Storm Atiyah with Met Éireann, as it moves towards Ireland.“Appropriate response and local co-ordination arrangements are in place,” it said in a statement on Saturday. ESB Networks are on standby to respond to any damage to the supply network arising from Storm Atiyah, it said. The team also contacted the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport “who will relay the current warnings to the transport operators”. This weekend’s storm is typical for this time of year due to the current “mobile Atlantic regime”, said Ms Coleman, adding that milder temperatures are set to continue in the coming days.“We’re at that period when it’s sometimes milder at night time than it is during the day,” she said. Temperatures will range between 6-8 degrees in the coming days, rising to 10 degrees at night.Once Storm Atiyah clears, Monday is expected to be a clear and dry day. However, milder air will bring rainfall on Tuesday and more unsettled weather. Temperatures are expected to become colder on Wednesday and Thursday.Named by Met Éireann, Atiyah (pronounced “Ah-tee-ya”) comes from a list compiled by the Irish forecaster and the UK Met Office to cover the 2019-2020 storm season.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Many of the victims were factory workers who were asleep when the blaze beganThe attack, which took place as the woman was on way to court, has sparked public outrageFirefighters in Australia say massive blaze will not be put out without heavy rainsGovernment under pressure to tackle culture of sexual violence against womenWidespread approval after men shot at scene of crime as activists question justificationSmoke and flying ash has lingered over city for most of week, turning daytime sky orangeMove\u0026rsquos exclusion of undocumented Muslim immigrants angers Opposition leadersWoman was to attend court hearing when she was doused with kerosene and set on fireBeijing considers visa restrictions on US diplomats over \u0026lsquoodious\u0026rsquo response to Xinjiang issueCanine found in Siberian permafrost unveiled on Monday \u0026ndash but it\u0026rsquos not yet clear what it isSearch continues for two other people who became stranded in remote landscape with little food and waterMPs speak out in parliament as people take to streets over killing of 27-year-old vetResidents heard chanting \u0026lsquorevolution of our time\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoliberate Hong Kong\u0026rsquoNobel laureate to defend Myanmar against charge of genocide against RohingyaFour men arrested over murder of veterinary doctor, which has left country in shockNew South Wales hopes devices that operate day and night in all weather can cut deathsAcademic Timothy Weeks was held with US man for more than three years until recent prisoner exchangeNK\u0026rsquos state media calls Japanese PM an \u0026lsquoimbecile and political dwarf\u0026rsquo in row over testPeople in Chinese-Irish associations \u0026lsquokeep an eye on everyone\u0026rsquo for signs of disloyaltyPolice withdraw from university campus that has seen some of the worst clashes"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Labour Party manifesto 2019: the key election policiesConservative Party manifesto 2019: the key election promisesWill tactical voting work in the 2019 election?

Data gathered by digital marketing firm SemRush noted an\u0026nbsp80 per cent correlation between search volume and bitcoin\u0027s price, though no conclusions were drawn as to which was the determining factor.Some analysts previously suggested that\u0026nbsptraders may be manipulating Google searches in order to artificially inflate the price of bitcoin.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Eliminated stars are often met by their loved ones after walking out of the jungle across the famous I’m a Celeb rope bridge.“NOBODY greeted Caitlyn at the bridge?

Shows money doesn’t mean anything! Would rather be skint with the family I have.”“No one came to greet Caitlyn?” read another. “All those family members and friends and no one showed up!”Created with Sketch.The 30 best TV shows of the decade Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable.

on Brexit have launched an app providing advice to voters ahead of the general election.In an effort to deprive Boris Johnson of a majority government, the Vote for a Final Say organisation provides tactical voting recommendations and identifies the candidate in each constituency who is backing a referendum and best-placed to win.Tony Blair and Sir John Major united to urge voters to put aside

“million miles away from what he and Nigel Farage promised in 2016” at the EU referendum.\u0026nbspAnother adds: “Boris Johnson is heading for a landslide, which will give\u0026nbspthe hard right of the Tory party total power to do whatever they like.”Mike Harris, chief executive of the communications agency 89up,\u0026nbspsaid: “The use of technology in political campaigning has become increasingly controversial over recent years.\u0026nbsp“But, used in the right way, people do not just have\u0026nbsprows and rows of dots on a screen. Instead, campaigns like Vote for a Final Say and For Our Future’s Sake want to build a better political system based on what real people say in real conversations.”\u0026nbspTwo ex-PMs join rally urging tactical votes to block Tory majorityAmanda Chetwynd-Cowieson,\u0026nbspco-founder of the For Our Future’s Sake campaign group, said that in dozens of constituencies across the country the “election is balanced on a knife-edge and there are just a few days left if we are\u0026nbspto stop Boris Johnson getting total power”.\u0026nbspShe added: “The most effective way of persuading people is to talk to them. At a time of year when millions of voters will be heading home for Christmas, we want to encourage families and friends to discuss how Brexit will impact on all our lives.\u0026nbsp“Too often politicians are stuck on broadcast, shouting their message even louder in a bid to get heard, but politics is at its most powerful when people talk to each other, seek to convince and change people’s minds, and listen to the other side of the argument.\u0026nbsp“That’s especially true in the most marginal constituencies where a few hundred votes separate the candidates, in these places just a few dozen informed conversations could make all the difference.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The protest, organised by the climate strike movement Fridays for Future, was also attended by many students, families and professionals.Just a few miles away, in the stuffy surroundings of Madrid’s largest conference centre, negotiators from across the world continued to try to hammer out the final details of the 2015 Paris Agreement.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMs Thunberg made a surprise appearance at the conference on Friday to meet other young activists before being whisked away by security. She had hitch-hiked her way across the world after the talks were moved from Chile due to civil unrest.Ms Thunberg later told reporters that the voices of climate strikers were being heard but not enough “concrete action” was taking place. Of course there is no victory, because the only thing we want to see is real action,” she said. “So we have achieved a lot, but if you look at it from a certain point of view we have achieved nothing.Created with Sketch.

Speaking at a panel run by the Association of Small Island States, Samoan student Brianna Fruean from 350 Samoa and the Pacific Climate Warriors, said it was critical to remember that some nations represented at the talks were fighting for sheer survival. “World leaders need to know that people like me are watching them.”The key sticking points of the talks, which began on Monday, are how to establish new international rules for carbon markets and how to help poorer countries pay for losses and damage caused by climate change.A decision on carbon market rules is proving tricky because of disagreements about what to do with the surplus credits from earlier emission trading schemes and how to avoid ‘double counting’ emission cuts that are traded overseas.Progress on loss and damage is also a long way off. Many vulnerable nations are pressing for a new financial mechanism to pay for major, one-off disasters such as hurricanes and typhoons, as well as longer term problems exacerbated by climate change.Hillary Clinton says male leaders are ‘scared’ of Greta ThunbergBut influential developed countries, particularly Australia, Japan and Switzerland (as well as the US, which is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement), do not want finance on the table at all because they think it will open the floodgates for future compensation claims.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAnother sensitive subject under discussion is how to ensure human rights are respected in climate action. Russia in particular is resistant to the discussion of human rights in any context.An underlying concern at the talks is the extent to which countries will be expected to be more ambitious when they revise their national carbon-cutting commitments next year.A recent report by UN Environment Programme warned that there was a huge gap between what countries had committed to so far and the goal of keeping global warming to a reasonably safe level. It found global fossil fuel production needs to be more than halved by 2030 to stay within a 1.5c temperature rise, with coal the biggest offender.Pressure to come to an agreement on these issues will rise next week as high-ranking national ministers arrive in Madrid. Whatever they decide will determine the path ahead to the next talks, which will be hosted by the UK in Glasgow next November.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I have accepted the result and I support Boris’s deal. The country must move on.It is fundamental to democracy that we implement the will of the people. Yet too many MPs have forgotten they promised to abide by the people’s decision.They spent three years trying to frustrate the result. Now they want to waste the next five doing the same.Every time one of the ultra-Remainers’ spurious claims is defeated, they invent another.They said Boris could not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement and Brussels would not budge. Boris stood his ground and proved them wrong.Now they say we will face a new clf-edge No Deal at the end of next year unless a trade deal is completed with the EU.But there is no comparison with what faced us before. We will have left the EU by then.Two big concerns — citizens’ rights and Northern Ireland — will have been dealt with.It is true that time will be tight. For that we can blame the MPs who did everything in their power to delay our exit.But Boris has proved he is an effective negotiator. Both sides want a trade deal and our economies are already aligned, making agreement easier.With a working majority, Boris’s hand will be stronger and the job will be done. Ultra-Remainers have conjured up this new No Deal spectre because they are desperate.They know thatBoris wins the General Election, we will leave the EU by the end of January and the game will be up.Their second referendum campaign is in tatters and the Liberal Democrats’ pledge to revoke Brexit has bombed.The clock is counting down to an election that could settle the issue once and for all. So they are resorting to ever-more ludicrous claims.So-called moderates should be ashamed of the insults they are hurling at Boris.It is absurd to call his agenda “far-right” or “extreme”.This language should be reserved to describe hateful movements such as the BNP or the National Front.It should not be casually thrown around by fools who have been so blinded by their hatred of Brexit they have lost all sense of proportion.Boris was a successful Mayor of London who won a second term and delivered for the public.His plans to boost funding for schools and the NHS, for more police and to increase the National Living Wage, are clearly mainstream.When Boris calls for tougher sentences for violent criminals, he is speaking squarely for the millions of quiet Brits who share these views.They hate being branded as extremists by metropolitan elitists who have lost touch with everyday concerns.Liberal Conservatives like me are entirely comfortable supporting today’s party.I have marched alongside Boris for gay rights. I have heard him speak passionately about protecting the environment. I have walked down streets and seen him connect with people like no other politician can.I cannot understand how anyone who previously called themselves a Conservative could bring themselves to urge people to vote against the party at this election.That is tantamount to saying Jeremy Corbyn should be PM.These Tory turncoats justy themselves by claiming Brexit will damage the economy. But the public rejected that argument when they voted for Brexit.And you can’t warn about jobs and investment while being willing to allow the catastrophic impact of a government led by Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.Never in my letime have I seen an agenda like Labour’s today: Ruinous nationalisation spending pledges the country cannot begin to pay for theof crushing union power a leader who has consistently sided with our country’s enemies and who refuses to tackle endemic racism in his own party.This isn’t the loony left. It is the lethal left.It is a blood-red recipe to crash the economy, impoverish our public services and relegate Britain to a third-rate power.No moderate should even consider supporting it. One by one, former Labour MPs are calling out Corbyn, warning us of the dangers.Why can’t the ultra-Remainer former Tory MPs and muddled old warhorses like Lord Heseltine, who once understood the threat of socialism, see it Blinded by their hatred of Brexit, they say the election offers a Hobson’s choice between two extremes.That is hogwash. There is no equivalence between Corbyn’s hard-left programme and Boris’ mainstream Conservative agenda.Evenyou want the referendum result reversed, which most people do not, a neo-Marxist in No cannot be a price worth paying.It is time for those who call themselves moderates to wake up and realise the truly extreme step would be to help make Corbyn PM next week.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But how can you not have a table How do you eat  Where do you have coffee  What do you put your shopping on when you come home  And where do you sityou want to read something  Which brings me on to another astonishing fact. Today, in Britain, , children do not own a single book.Obviously, I’m aware that children would much rather shoot an alien in the face than read some drivel by Jane Austen. And I get that. I’d rather gouge my own eyes out with a trowel than read anything by Jane Austen. And I’d certainly rather play Call Of Duty.I’ll admit, too, that book people spend far too much time being bookish and earnest with other book people. Which is why the book that wins the Booker Prize is always more impenetrable than a Hawthorn bush.It’s usually just a lot of women wondering about flowers. Have I read either of this year’s joint winners  No. I’d rather eat my own sick. But the idea of living in a house with no books at all is actually quite frightening.Because then there’d be no Winnie The Pooh, and more worryingly, no Jack Reacher.They’ve tried to capture the essence of this man mountain on television and, hilariously, with Tom Cruise in the role at the cinema, but nothing beats the books. They’re all the same. Jack walks into a small town in America. He has some coffee. Notices a pretty girl. Punches eight men in the face. Sleeps with the pretty girl. Saves the town from the baddies by punching them all in the face and then walks off at the end.I swear to God thatyou could get your kids to put down their phones for a day, and read a Jack Reacher book, they’d never want to do social media again. I know that’s impossible. I know you can’t get a kid to put down its phone for more than  seconds. I’m just saying thatyou could . . .So what about school  Kids are made to read by teachers, but the books they select are always as dull as being dead. Andyou make kids read boring books for exams, they will grow up to hate reading.So ditch Austen and Donne and Shakespeare and Milton. Put them on the top shelf of a library and leave them there. Instead, to make reading fun, make them study Jack Reacher and books by Jilly Cooper and Jeffrey Archer.Even EL Jamesthat’s what it takes. Anything that gets them reading. Anything that makes books cool. It won’t work for everyone of course. Some kids will not enjoy a book no matter how good the story might be.But that’s OK. They can go off and do carpentry instead. Then they could make the family a table.APPARENTLY,  people complained about a raunchy appearance by the Pussycat Dolls on last weekend’s X Factor final.Some say the performance was “shameful” while others said the “strip show” was “absolutely disgraceful”.I couldn’t agree more. We sat through a rubbish song and at the end, they were wearing exactly the same amount of clothing as they had been at the start.But almost all of them these days are NEVER seen in public without a phone in one hand and . . . a plastic bottle of water in the other.I don’t know when it became compulsory to have water about your person at all times, but it’s stupid.Yes. You need wateryou are in the desert and you’re hundreds of miles from a tap and it’s C.But at all other times, you should drink beer.Because that comes in a glass bottle that doesn’t end up wrapped round some poor unfortunate sea creature’s head.AFTER about three hours my back bottom went to sleep but the rest of me was still gripped by Martin Scorsese’s new epic, The Irishman.Mostly, however, I was gripped by how badly the phenomenally expensive de-ageing technology works.It’s used in flash- backs to turn ageing stars Robert De Niro and Al Pacino into younger men but it makes them look like Bill and Ben.And their plastic faces are at odds with their elderly bodies.Pity. I was rather hoping we could use tech like this in the next Grand Tour to make me look like Charles Leclerc.It’s reckoned that David has climbed  places in the list of most popular boys’ names thanks to the work done by David Attenborough.Really. But what about those who are naming their kids after David Cameron, or David Jason Or even the popular television channel.That’s what I’d doI had another kid.Call it Amazon. Good name actually.I SEE Q Branch has fitted James Bond’s rebuilt Aston Martin DB with mini guns that pop out from behind the headlights.That’s excellent, as a brace of these fearsome weapons can fire , rounds a minute. That’s  every second.The trouble is, that they can’t. I once flew a helicopter that had been fitted with miniguns on its skids and every time I pulled the trigger, one bullet would set off in the wrong direction and then the gun would jam.There’s another issue too. If Bond’s car carries enough bullets for two minutes of sustained fire, he’d need , bullets. Which together would weigh around ,lb. Oh, and the ammo storage box would be huge, too.These, then, are weapons that only really work on the screen. When they’re not actually firing anything at all.ELDERLY residents in the seaside town of Bournemouth started a petition as soon as they heard that a “pot shop” was due to open in their community.They said: “The area already struggles massively with anti-social behaviour and the last thing the community needs is an establishment promoting the use of narcotics right opposite impressinable youngsters.”Couple of things on that. They spelled “impressionable” wrong. And more importantly, the pot shop that had got them so riled was going to sell . . . pottery.This is a bit like that story from a while ago where angry locals daubed slogans and smashed windows of the house of the local paediatrician.Because they thought the brass plaque on the door said “paedophile”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s not true this time: it is the MOST IMPORTANT VOTE in our letimes.At stake is whether we leave the EU or not. You may think that was settled by the Brexit referendum — and it should have been. But any result other than a Tory majority will lead to more efforts to overturn the referendum result.It will mean another year when politicians argue about whether to accept what people voted for in June , rather than focusing on schools, hospitals and all the other domestic issues that matter so much.There are TWO POSSIBLE RESULTS in this election: a Tory majority or another hung Parliament. Even John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, is talking about how Labour would try to governit didn’t have a majority.Another hung Parliament would be more of the same: Parliamentary gridlock and no progress. What would a Parliament without a majority for any party be able to agree on beyond a second referendum It is not even certain it could do that. You would need a government for a second referendum and Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said she would rather have another election than put either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn into No.So we may well all be heading to the polls AGAIN in Februarythere is no clear result this time. Eventhey could unite on a second referendum, they wouldn’t be able to agree on much . It would be a single-issue government, to the detriment of everything .When Labour make extravagant promises it has a double credibility problem. First, how will it pay for them  It is not realistic to say you can fund spending equivalent to half an NHS every year just by taxing the rich and big business a bit more.Second, will they actually happen given that Labour won’t win a majority  In a hung Parliament, Labour will only be able to do those things that Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists and the Liberal Democrats agree to.By contrast, a Tory majority government would not be more of the same. It would break the Brexit deadlock. This country would leave on January . This will not settle the question of Britain’s future relationship with the EU, but it will mean that Brexit won’t continue to suck up all of Parliament’s energies.A majority government is also more easily held to account. If the Tories win one, then at the next election voters will be able to seethey have delivered on what they said that would do: There will  be no excuses and no hiding places. Right now, the Tories are on course for a majority. I understand their own internal numbers indicate a working majority.But these margins are very fine, and victory could slip awayvoters don’t turn out. If Boris Johnson does win a majority next week, it will be because he has presented himself as change. Not just the person who can break the deadlock, but a leader with a dferent agenda to the one the Tories have had these past nine years.As Prime Minister of a majority government, he would have to deliver on that agenda. He would have to create the conditions for the economy to flourish far outside London and the South East, he would have to improve the NHS and our infrastructure.Having been elected as a dferent kind of Tory, he will have to govern as that. This country has been in limbo for too long. It needs a Parliament that can take decisions, not just play for time.According to one campaign source: “There is still a nervousness about letting it run wild.”But there is a recognition that the Tories  need a bit of pizzazz in the last few days and that Boris  needs, “the energy of a walkabout”.The Tory plan is to “close hard”. They are, privately, cautiously optimistic.One Cabinet minister says: “In  you could feel it slipping away, it doesn’t feel like that this time.”But they have held back nearly all their online advertising budget for the last few days to guard against any last-minute swing back to Labour.FEW expected Donald Trump to be able to resist getting involved in the election on his visit here for the Nato summit.But in the end, Trump, largely, kept his views to himself.I understand that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was key in persuading him not to derail Boris Johnson’s election effort.Kushner, who has a leading role at the White House, developed a good relationship with Johnson when the latter was Foreign Secretary and was keen not to have the visit create any distractions.If he doesn’t, we will  have a second referendum where voters will be asked to choose between Remain and Remain-lite. Nigel Farage is badly miscalculating in his refusal to tell voters in Labour Tory marginals to back the Tories.If Labour hold on in seats such as High Peak in Derbys, it will be because of the Brexit Party standing in a seat that it has no chance of winning.One veteran Eurosceptic who has been part of an effort to get the Brexit Party to make clear that voters shouldn’t back it where it has no chance of winning blames Richard Tice, the Brexit Party chair and its candidate in Hartlepool, for blocking any such move.This source tells me Tice is “a nightmare, he is a far bigger problem than Farage”.This election is going to come down to fine margins. The Brexit Party vote could well let Labour hang on in some crucial seats.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was clear how preposterous the audience found it.He then claimed, absurdly, that socialism has a better record than capitalism for raising the poor’s living standards.That will be news to Venezuela, which Corbyn once hailed as an ideal ­economic model but which is now a ­living hell of starvation and squalor.Boris was simply more convincing and more statesmanlike. Corbyn, even in a suit, is still the same old backbench crank nursing -year-old grievances.It is incredible anyone would consider putting him in power.THE smearing of Boris as a racist by a Channel  “mistake” is an outrage.We pray it was not deliberate. The channel’s journalists make no secret of their loathing for the Tories.Its news chief branded Boris a liar and presenter Jon Snow likes to chant “f*** the Tories”.Assuming it was a genuine error, what does it say about the culture of a ­supposedly impartial TV network that no one questioned it How did this happen  TV chiefs must come clean.The channel’s apology came too late to stop Corbyn’s Twitter trolls spreading it.Six days from the most crucial election in a letime, it’s a sacking offence.IT is time for the men in white coats to wheel off John Major, Tony Blair and their europhile has-been mates to a safe space where they can gibber together out of harm’s way.Brexit derangement has so utterly confused and consumed them that they are now campaigning against a Tory victory — and thus for the only alternative: a Marxist-run Corbyn coalition.They somehow prefer the immediate economic harm and global shock of that to a stable Tory Government delivering on the majority’s democratic will.These old men simply cannot cope with their defeat three years ago and seek vengeance on those who beat them.They really are that barking. GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ll be luckyI manage an hour.But . . . I have plenty of company and protection, and by the time you are reading this on Sunday morning, I will have ed to the comfort of home for a hot bath, home-cooked meal and the support of my family.Others are not so lucky.Astonishingly, the number of people now sleeping rough across the UK each night is higher than at any time since World War Two.The reasons behind homelessness are complex and repetitive.A troubled upbringing perhaps, alienation around mental health issues, and, in the case of the rising numbers of female rough sleepers, many are fleeing domestic abuse.But the biggest issue remains drug addiction.Martin Stone, who runs the Muswell Hill soup kitchen in North London, recently spoke out on the central problem driving homelessness and street violence.“The waste, the tragedy and the misery makes me angry,” he wrote.“But the targets of my fury are not the street sleepers but the smugly fashionable middle-class drug users who are fuelling this evil trade.”He pointed out that there are hostels or beds available, but “most street sleepers will have been banned because of their lestyle drug use, selling drugs or antisocial behaviour”.Similarly, John Bird, founder of The Big Issue, called for the public to donate to homelessness and drugs charities rather than give money directly to someone who will probably use the cash to buy drugs.The overwhelming conclusion is that more needs to be done to find intelligent, long-term solutions to help those trapped in this vicious cycle to get back on their feet.That’s where The Big Sleep Out comes in — a worldwide collaboration with the aim of raising around millionfor charities that help tackle homelessness in our cities, as well as those assisting those displaced globally through war, poverty or disaster.This year, Hollywood star Will Smith read a story to those gathered in New York’s Times Square, while myself and the , others sleeping out under Nelson’s Column are treated to a bedtime story from Dame Helen Mirren and an acoustic set from Scottish band Travis.Other celebrities who slept out in Trafalgar Square included Matt Willis, Jamelia, Anita Rani and Julie Etchingham.Dame Helen said: “It was heart-warming to see so many people come together to highlight the global issue of homelessness.”These are the two main sites for The Big Sleep Out — endorsed by, among many others, The Big Issue — but thousands more are being sponsored to sleep out in locations including LA, Cardf, Chicago, Brisbane, Edinburgh and Dublin.To give some idea of how the money raised will help, £, provides a shower, meal and laundered clothes for  people or can give a homeless single mum and her kids a home for four months.The global event is the brainchild of Josh Littlejohn MBE, co-founder of the Edinburgh-based charity Social Bite, which started out as a small sandwich shop.“We ended up meeting this young homeless guy called Pete.We got chatting to him and asked him the story of how he became homeless and one day he came into the shop and plucked up the courage to askhe could have a job,” says Josh, .“We figured that the whole point of us being here is to try to do something good, so we gave him a job in the kitchen.”Now,  per cent of Social Bite staff across its five shops are people who are either homeless or have experienced it, and the initiative has had visits from, among others, actors George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio, as well as Prince Charles, Camilla, Harry and Meghan.In  Josh held his first, relatively small, sleep out in Edinburgh to try to garner the support of local companies.In  , people — including Sir Bob Geldof and Rob Brydon — overnighted in Edinburgh’s Princes Street, and last year it was , in Scotland’s four major cities.Josh and his team joined forces with local council bosses to build Social Bite Village, a supervised, safe living environment.“We met lots of homeless people and got an understanding of the root causes, how it started from childhood, routinely in the care system or they were abused as a kid, and at  became homeless,” he says.“You realise you’ve got such a stereotypical perception that people made bad decisions and became addicts. But these are people that just got dealt the worst cards you can imagine and society, when they reached , just turned its back.”Generally speaking, there are three types of homelessness: Rough sleeping, statutory homelessness and the hidden kind.Rough sleepers are the most visible, and many of those spending nights out in the cold suffer from a iety of physical conditions, mental health issues and drug misuse. They are also at greater risk of suffering violence.Statutory homelessness is when you either lack a secure place in which you are entitled to live or are not reasonably able to stay.Local authorities are legally obliged to provide temporary accommodation to those who might meet the criteria and this is regarded as the main homelessness duty. But, as ever, it is riven with box-ticking bureaucracy.Lastly, there is hidden homelessness, the people who aren’t entitled to help or who don’t bother to ask. Instead they couch-surf, stay in squats or scrape together funds for the occasional night in a hostel or BB.Across the UK there are hundreds of outreach units working   to help alleviate the immediate issues surrounding homelessness, providing a warm bed, a hot meal or administrative support to access the right help.But given the addiction issue, perhaps the most important are those working tirelessly to try to break the destructive cycle of those selling drugs to fund their habit.They are the charities that deliver services on behalf of local authorities, including children and families interventions, clinical services, criminal justice services, detox and rehab, support with housing, prison-based services and psychosocial services.It is unlikely rough sleeping will be fully eradicated by ,ever. But we more fortunate should do all we can to fund intelligent solutions to the crisis.If you are someone who thinks recreational, dinner-party drug use is harmless, read this article carefully, think again and stop it.JACK RICHARDSON’s mum died of lung cancer when he was  and he went into foster care, where he was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome.At  he signed himself out of care and ended up sleeping rough on and off for two decades.Jack, now , said: “I’ve had my sleeping bag set on fire, I’ve been beaten up for my takings, I’ve been spat at. It can be dehumanising.“And the rats nibble on your fingertips so you have to keep your hands inside your bag.”Jack turned to drink and drugs and attempted suicide.But in  he contacted The Big Issue, where he found work and support.Jack married one of his customers, Toni Osbourne, , and they live in a Housing Association flat in the Clton area of Bristol.SONNY MURRAY knows better than most how important the Big Sleep Out campaign is.He was working as a commis chef when a brawl landed him a six-month prison sentence – and caused his world to fall apart.He got hooked on drugs, lost his flat and spent two years living on the “brutal” streets.His luck changed when charity Social Bite gave him a job educating other homeless people and helped him get a one-bed flat in Bathgate, West Lothian.Praising the Big Sleep Out, the dad-of-three,  –  who is now off drugs – said: “I would like to thank The Sun on Sunday for backing this campaign and urge anyone reading this to get involved.

Corbyn would bankrupt the nation. Corbyn despises this country. Corbyn has spent a career licking the boots of terrorists. Corbyn never met a hate preacher he didn’t like.If Jeremy Corbyn gets elected on Thursday then, in the words of The Carpenters, it will be yesterday once more — and ato the ravages of gormless Socialism, red in tooth and claw, unseen since the Seventies.We have forgotten what mass unemployment is like in this country. We have forgotten what soaring inflation is like. We have forgotten what it is like to endure endless strikes. Corbyn would bring it all back — and worse.For Jeremy Corbyn has no love for this country. He has no affection for our people, our history or our flag.Personally, I couldn’t give a flying figCorbyn watches the Queen’s speech on Christmas Day.But it does bother me that he always takes the side of this country’s enemies.It concerns me that his “friends” include terrorists such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA. It disturbs me like hell that Corbyn can even find excuses for Russian thugs conducting their murderous business on British soil.Jeremy Corbyn despises the nation he seeks to lead. And that scares me most of all.Thursday will dawn cold, dark and with the possibility of snow. This close to Christmas, nobody feels like going to a polling booth. But this close to a terrorist-sympathising Marxist moron seizing power, we can’t afford NOT to vote.There are real problems that the incoming government will need to address on day one.Yes, our departure from the European Union is absolutely crucial. But no matter how much we may despise the unelected fat cats in Brussels, the nations of Europe will always be our neighbours and should always be our friends.Leaving the EU while maintaining good trading relations with it is no easy day at the office.And the new PM will have far more than Brexit to deal with. The housing crisis has made owning your own home an impossible dream for the younger generation.The pressures on our schools, roads and NHS are at breaking point. The working man and woman pay too much tax. Serious crime is rising. Climate change is real.All this is waiting in our new Prime Minister’s inbox.Jeremy Corbyn — a stupid, tenth-rate little man with stale, left-wing clichés where his brain should be — is clearly not up to the job.He is an economic cretin who would empty your pockets. He is a spineless hypocrite on Brexit. He has enabled racism to enter the bloodstream of the Labour Party. And he hates the wicked West.“What goes around comes around,” Corbyn sneered when almost , people were murdered on  .Every time there is a terrorist attack, Corbyn finds a way of saying that we had it coming.On Thursday, YOUR vote can keep the worthless old git and his deranged supporters from power.This country deserves better than Jeremy Corbyn.THE Pirelli Calendar was once the byword for lavishly shot sexiness, but it is struggling to find its role in the modern world.Pretentious pictures of Emma Watson as a po-faced nun are probably not the answer to the Italian firm’s dilemma.Next year Pirelli should just print pictures of tyres.It has to be more interesting than this pompous cobblers.HARDCORE James Bond fans have long feared that an increasingly politically correct  was becoming licensed to kill joy.Bond had started coming over all woke. Daniel Craig never needs much encouragement to moan about Bond’s old-fashioned, sexist ways, while sources have claimed that the term “Bond girls” is now banned on  film sets as it is deemed unacceptable in the modern era.All very worthy. And all light years away from the gritty, sexy essence of Ian Fleming’s iconic hero.But the good news is that the trailer for the new Bond movie, No Time To Die, dropped this week and it looks exactly like a  blockbuster should look.Evil villains dreaming of world domination. Fast cars and fast women. Fiendishly clever gadgets. Car chases that would get you nine points on your licence.AndAna de Arma is not the ultimate Bond girl, then my name is Pussy Galore.WHEN I was a child, my family would make a -mile round trip just to gawp at the Christmas wonders of London.The lights of the West End. Santa’s grotto in Selfridges.And the giant Christmas tree given to us every year since  by the nation of Norway, grateful to us for chasing out the Nazis.This year the tree in Trafalgar Square is, frankly, a bit of a disappointment.Did the Norwegians forget to water it That’s not a giant Christmas tree.It’s a big twig.I’m not sure I would go to the end of the garden to see it, let alone drive all the way from Billericay.THE Duchess of Cambridge is such a great ambassador for the Royal Family.In these dficult days, with Prince Andrew all sweaty and Prince Harry all sulky, the glorious Kate never puts a foot wrong.Look at her helping out at a charity for disadvantaged kids on a Christmas tree farm in Great Missenden, Bucks.Sometimes I think that, after the Queen has gone, there is no future for the monarchy in modern Britain.But then I look at Kate – always smiling, always gracious – and I change my mind.WHEN BBC-approved comedian Nish Kumar appeared at The Lord’s Taverners Christmas Lunch he was booed off stage and narrowly dodged a bread roll.Nish made the mistake of trotting out lame anti-Brexit quips that would have had the canned laughter turned up to ten on any BBC  show.This material doesn’t work so well in the real world.The Lord’s Taverners is a cricket charity that supports children living in poverty or with disability. A very good cause.But the audience at their Christmas beano had no appetite for jokes about evil Tories. Although jokes about evil Tories will get your contract renewed at the BBC.Nish, the host of The Mash Report – me neither – told the audience: “I should have known this would happen when I agreed to do a set in front of people who colonised my ancestors.”Desperate stuff, Nish.I very much doubtanyone at that charity lunch colonised anyone’s ancestors.One of these BBC-approved comics should do a stand-up routine on Diane Abbott’s mathematics.Or the Labour Party’s inability to elect a woman leader in  years.This is all worthy of biting satire!But then they would never be asked back on Mock The Week, or The Mash Report nor any of the Beeb’s dreary, joyless, biased crap.Nish Kumar’s humiliation in the real world begs the question: Why should we all pay the BBC £. a year for a licence fee when it only represents the views of some of us Kumar – and all of these BBC-approved comedians – should stay in Broadcasting House.They will be safe there – Nish, Dara O Briain, Sandi Toksvig, Jo Brand and all the rest.They should never go into the real world.Someone might chuck a bread roll at them.PRINCE WILLIAM says he “recycles as much as he can”.Any chance of leaving his beleaguered uncle, the Duke of York, out for the bin men If Andrew is as innocent as he claims in his dealings with child-abusing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, then he should go to the United States and do whatever it takes to clear his name.Until he does so, the former Randy Andy is an embarrassment to his family.And his country. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The prize for backing Boris is ensuring Brexit next month — rather than a second EU vote or another poll on Scottish independence.The Tories have splashed out election cash securing a key position yesterday on YouTube, where viewers are told they can “End The Uncertainty” over Brexit.The party leaders were out campaigning yesterday. Boris Johnson was in Cheadle, Greater Manchester, Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn visited Barry, South Wales, the Lib Dems’ Jo Swinson was in St Albans, Herts, and the Brexit Party’s Mr Farage in Sedgefield, Co Durham.JUST , voters in battleground seats have the destiny of Brexit in their hands.Swing voters in kne-edge constituencies will be crucial on Thursday in decidingBoris Johnson gets it done.But there are fears Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party could gain enough votes to stop him ing to No .Election analyst Lord Hayward said: “For those who want toa pro-Brexit MP, they will need to support the Conservative candidate.”The Tory peer’s eve-of-poll reckoning shows that between ten and  thousand — a tiny fraction of the UK’s million electorate — hold the country’s fate in their hands.Mr Johnson winning a majority in the early hours of Friday morning will see a Commons vote before Christmas Day and ensure the UK leaves the EU at the end of January.But a hung Parliament would likely lead to Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street, propped up by the SNP and the Lib Dems — leading to another EU vote and a new independence referendum in Scotland.And Mr Farage’s decision to field candidates in all seats not held by Conservatives could see tight results.The Brexit Party itself looks unlikely to win anywhere, having fallen to around three per cent in the polls. But Eurosceptics still voting for them could let in Labour MPs.Lord Hayward said the crunch seats will be Labour marginals where people voted Leave. These include Crewe and Nantwich, where Labour hold a wafer-thin -vote ­majority.A battle for last-minute votes will also be waged in Ashfield, Notts, where Labour are holding on to a  majority.Lord Hayward said: “If you are undecided between the Tories and the Brexit Party in the constituencies I’ve identied and others, there is no question you should vote Conservative.“There will be a number of seats in this group that are decided by only a few hundred or possibly a thousand votes. Any decision that people make has to be made in the full knowledge that this is a series of very close contests.“It will depend on how the result ends up, butit is close to a hung Parliament or not, then probably about -, will decide that.“In the case of West and South Yorkshire, the ‘red wall’ is full of seats that will be crucial.“In this election, you can’t draw a straight line and say, ‘If that’s a majority, these seats will change’. It will come down to small groups of voters in a small group of seats.”Earlier this week four Brexit Party MEPs urged voters to “Back Boris” on Thursday. John Longworth, who was sacked by the party on Wednesday, said: “For those who want Brexit, Boris Johnson’s deal is the only option available. Labour does not have a plan.”Results across the country could also see some big names booted out.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is the highest-profile politician at risk, despite his , majority.He is being targeted by the Lib Dems hoping to draw in Labour Remain supporters.Even party leaders Boris Johnson and Jo Swinson could be in trouble as rivals flood their constituencies with activists.The bookies say BoJo has a  per cent chance of losing his Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat. Lib Dem chief Swinson has a  per cent chance of missing out in East Dunbartonshire.Environment Minister Zac Goldsmith has only a -vote majority while Iain Duncan Smith is threatened by Labour in Chingford and Woodford Green.Labour figures at risk include Shadow Minister Laura Pidcock in North West Durham and veteran Dennis Skinner, who has held his Bolsover seat since .A bellwether seat for TV viewers to watch out for will be Dartford in Kent.

But we are also their role models in terms of food choices. If we breakfast on Pringles, pizza and doughnuts then the odds are they will too.By the same token,we start the day with porridge, seeds and fruit, they’ll likely grow up assuming that’s the best way.School is a huge influence, too, and it is great Jamie did succeed. In fact, he started a nationwide trend of schools providing and promoting a healthy diet.But some schools are taking it too far. At one primary I know of, teachers and dinner ladies patrol the lunchtime tables hunting out contraband such as sugary drinks and chocolate, to confiscate it then attempt to shame the parents into submission with letters about their snack misdemeanours.Other schools, it has emerged, are taking it even further than that, with pupils being followed when school has ended.Yes, following them from the school gates to the high street to intervenethey are seen going into a takeaway.Children at Cotham School, in Bristol, have been told they are not allowed to enter at least three convenience stores and a takeaway between .pm and .pm.Not only that, but school staff acting as bouncers have been patrolling the shopping parade and standing in high-vis jackets outside the chippy.The school says it is using powers given by Michael Gove’s  Education Act, which allows it to rule over the conduct of pupils in certain circumstances outside the school gates.The school’s business manager, Allison Crossland, said teachers have the authority over what the pupils do even after the end of the school day.And they are doing so to, “ensure the safety of children on their way home from school”.According to one takeaway owner, teachers went inside and started giving out detentions to children they found in there, although the school denies this.But the takeaway shops on the street say they have seen a drop in business since Cotham School staff started patrolling the streets and, unsurprisingly, they are up in arms as a result.I’m not saying it’s great for kids to snack on high-fat or sugary food when they leave school. Of course it’s not.But is it really the responsibility of their teachers to make sure they don’t  Is it right teachers can rule on what your kids eat when they leave school I don’t think so. AndI was a parent of a child being told what to eat by someone other than me, I’d be furious.I know some people will say this comes down to money, that it’s more expensive to eat healthily.And yes, it is cheaper and easier to snack on sugary foods such as chips and biscuits.Some might say that school dinners are not satisfying enough.Parents need to take it upon themselves to learn about how to cook and eat healthily.You don’t have to spend a fortune to eat well. Look at Jack Monroe, who has written a book on how to cook well with tinned food.There is no doubt something needs to change when it comes to kids and food.The number of obese people in the UK has almost doubled in  years. Rather than paying staff to patrol the chippy, I would vote to bring back domestic science and teach all children how to cook properly from scratch.But as parents, it is our duty, and no one ’s, to look after our children and teach them how to eat well.I KNOW they were doing important work at the Nato summit and all . . . But bloody hell, it was easy for the onlooker to be distracted, wasn’t it, with all the world leaders’ power-mongering going on First of all there were the handshakes. The amount of one-upmanship that can occur in a simple greeting is staggering: Who gets to overpower who by making sure their hand is firmly on top throughout the shake.Who lets go and de-shakes first, and who insists on prolonging the handshake so enthusiastically that it is impossible for the other party to get away until the prolonger is good and ready.Donald Trump famously shakes LONG and HARD. I think it is called the Power Shake and is often employed by people who think the harder they squeeze, the more important and manly they are.They hold on to show they have control over you. But at this summit, Trump possibly met his match with Canada’s Justin Trudeau, who was repeatedly filmed gripping people’s hands so hard that both sets of knuckles were going white.Mind you, that is better than the limp shake. No one likes nor trusts someone with a limp handshake. It’s like shaking hands with a person with no bones.But my least favourite is the sweaty-palm shake.And then there was the footage of Trudeau, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson apparently gossiping about Trump like a bunch of naughty schoolboys.Where’s the leadership qualities in behaving like that It all left me feeling like they need to grow up.And then I saw the photo of our magnicent Queen and all  Nato allies. Guess how many women were in the group  I counted seven, including the Queen. I can’t help but thinkthere were more women involved, less of this childish stuff would go on.But it comes with at least one benefit: An utterly fabulous clothing budget!I have never seen Melania in the same outfit twice .She wore a coat a few months ago which I quite liked the look of, so I thought I might buy it.I looked it up online and it was £,, for something made out of wool. I passed! Mind you, whatever the cost, she looks great and oozes class.I SHUDDERED when I read the story of Jayney Nascimento, , who borrowed £, from her mother for liposuction in the hope of having skinnier legs. But instead of getting the legs of her dreams, she contracted a deadly flesh-eating bug called necrotising fasciitis, which left her fighting for her le and she almost had her legs amputated.Jayney, an administrator from Shropshire, says: “I paid for an expensive cosmetic procedure so I would feel comfortable showing off my legs.“Instead, I nearly lost them and I hate them more now than I did before the operation.”Talk about a sobering reminder that all cosmetic surgery is invasive and has potentially le-threatening side-effects. Is it really worth it I’m guessing this woman would say no.CHRISTIE Brinkley was photographed looking absolutely spectacular at an event in New York. Wearing this black, trenchcoat-style mini- dress, with bedazzling purse and sparkly calf boots she seemed about half her age, which is, incredibly, .If I have half of her joie de vivre and charisma at that age, I will be over the moon.And so should she be.POOR Rhodri Giggs, who told this week about the devastating effect brother Ryan’s affair with his we has had on the family. Quite understandably, he hasn’t spoken to footballer Ryan, , in eight years, since the affair with Rhodri’s we Natasha was revealed.But shockingly, he said his mother Lynne hasn’t spoken to him in the past eight years.Rhodri, , says she has taken Ryan’s side: “Because I haven’t got  medals, I haven’t played for Manchester United for -odd years and own a big house.”Turns out this was a triple betrayal. His we. His brother. His mother. Your entire support network gone overnight. Shame on his motherthat is true.DID anyone  wince over Jeremy Corbyn vowing to confront Donald Trump at this week’s Buckingham Palace reception It was about the sanctity of the NHS, which Trump does not appear to be interested in having anything to do with anyway.In the end, Corbyn didn’t get a chance as he was kept firmly away from the US President, possibly after publicly announcing his intentions.But the US is our main ally and it’s quite shocking that on a visit by the President, the opposition leader has to be kept away from Trump because he can’t be trusted to act with respect.What a calamity it would behe became the leader on December .JUST when I thought my admiration for black cab drivers had reached a peak, I got an invitation to a Christmas lunch organised by the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans.They offered Christmas lunch – turkey and all the trimmings – to  veterans who were taken to the venue by a fleet of black cabs driven by volunteer cabbies.It is so heart-warming that it actually brought a tear to my eye.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM’s latest fabrication is the claim that our security allies - the so-called Five Eyes nations of America, Australia, Canada and New Zealand who share the most sensitive intelligence - have expressed concerns about a Corbyn premiership. “They’ve never expressed them to me,” says Mr Corbyn. “This is another example of Boris Johnson ’s vivid and very inaccurate imagination. “When he was Foreign Secretary the endless rude remarks he made about people and his inability to conduct himself in diplomatic language was a greater problem than anything .  “I want to work with other countries to bring about a more secure world.” This is unlike Jeremy Corbyn . He never makes personal attacks on political enemies. He didn’t have a bad word for Theresa May . But for Johnson he makes an exception. The Labour leader adds: “He has an easy flow of indelicate language which can be offensive to many people. “If you’re representing your country you should treat people with respect.” The Tories have used the London Bridge terror tragedy nine days ago to beat Labour with, despite David Merritt, whose son Jack, , was one of two killed, describing that as “vile propaganda.” The Tories have even tried to promote the hood that security service MI and secret intelligence service MI would be under threatMr Corbyn was PM. He was quick to scotch that idea: “They will get what they need. “We will provide sufficient funding for the security services and the police.  “We want to keep people safe and secure, both from threats in the near future and the longer term.” Another blond the Labour leader is unimpressed with is Donald Trump , whose helicopter clattered loudly over the Corbyn household in Islington, north London when the US president visited last week for NATO th anniversary celebrations. Mr Corbyn said: “It was very big and very noisy, rather like the man himself.”  And Mr Corbyn does not believe Mr Trump’s assertion that he would not touch the NHSit was offered to him on a platter in a post-Brexit trade deal. Mr Corbyn said: “Not so long ago he said the NHS was on the table along with all other public services. “They’ve been discussing the NHS for two years. Two years on medicine prices and patents. I’ve no evidence that they are not continuing those discussions. “Yes, we will trade with the US in the future, but access to the UK does not include our public services. Our public services are there to serve the public.” Mr Corbyn offers no succour to Prince Andrew either who now faces questioning by the FBI over his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Mr Corbyn said: “The first issue here is the victims. And the young women who are victims should be the first consideration. “And, secondly, no one is above the law or above being questioned for their behaviour.  “Of course everyone has a presumption of innocence before accusations can be tested in courtthat’s where it ends up. “Inevitably this has done damage to the Royal Family. But everyone must recognise that the law must apply equally to everyone. “We cannot allow young people to be put at risk.” Mr Corbyn has visited more than  constituencies so far during the campaign and travelled over , miles.  I met him at a stopover at the £million Winwood Heights retirement village just outside Nottingham, a model for what the Labour leader wants social care in Britain to look like. The development saw two s tower blocks transformed for independent living, and a new one built for those who need extra care with communal facilities for all residents which opened three months ago. The views are stunning over a leafy park and the city itself and the on-site hairdressing salon also offers manicures and pedicures. Mr Corbyn and I decided we’d quite like to retire there ourselves. He said: “This is a brilliant example of what an imaginative local authority can achieve and people here seem incredibly happy because they’ve got their own private space and the support of the staff. “This is the sort of care facility I aspire to for the whole country.” He played the part of caller at the afternoon bingo session...and the first number he drew was No! Mr Corbyn’s plan to give Waspi women born in the s up to £, compensation for having their pensions stolen by the Tories could be a game changer with their .million votes. But he says it’s not about that. “They have been very badly treated and we have a moral obligation to them to put that right.” But £billion to fund the pledge is a lot of money to find. He said: “We might have to borrow to pay for it but our moral obligation will be honoured. “After we distilled together all our manesto policies I said they all had to be honoured. That meant we had to detail the finance, expenditure and extra tax on the top five per cent of earners and corporation tax. “But what we are doing will also lead to economic growth because of investments in infrastructure, broadband and green industries which means more tax income.” But to do any of this means winning on Thursday and Brexit hangs over how people will vote. What Mr Corbyn is offering is a new deal with the EU which would give us many of the benefits of membership but without a seat at the decision-making table. The choice at a second referendum would be that or to remain - with a seat at the table. What, I wondered, is in it for Leavers  Mr Corbyn said: “They can vote to leave the EU and we wouldn’t be part of the common agriculture and fisheries policies. “But leavers didn’t vote to lose their jobs or deregulate the economy “It will be an offer we will put there alongside remain and my government would be there to deliver on that referendum result and it’s my job to be the honest broker in that process.”  Mr Corbyn is fond of his home but recognises that he, we Laura and cat El Gato must live at Nohe becomes PM. “You kinda have to, don’t you  I want to do the job and I want to deliver on that job. And no matter how much I like my own house doing the job is more important.” But there will be changes. To the famous Downing Street rose garden for a start which has played host to world leaders for nearly  years and where the new PM would want to have his own allotment. “I shall grow vegetables there. They must have done that during the war. The growing revolution is good for everyone.” Christmas Day at No will be much like previous ones, though. Midnight mass on Christmas Eve followed by a visit to homeless shelters on Christmas morning. The Labour leader will not reveal what he will be buying Laura, and imagines she will most likely get him gloves. He said: “She won’t buy me a book because she’s fed up with me filling the house with books.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labours ellie reeves takes new","story":"NewsLabours Ellie Reeves takes new baby campaigning after giving birth days into raceLabour MP couple Ellie Reeves and John Cryer have one Labour gain in the bag - and baby Thomas is already getting helping to knock on doorsShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  DEC NewsMum Ellie Reeves with Dad John Cryer and baby Thomas on the campaign trail \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Ellie, , was stuffing envelopes at her home in her Lewisham West seat within days of her second son’s arrival - and last week the pair took him out knocking on doors for the first time. The Labour candidate for Lewisham West and Penge in South London admits the baby “slept through most of it” but that voters were “generally really nice and sympathetic” when they saw her with a pram. Her husband John, who represents Leyton and Wanstead in East London, has carried on campaigning without any real break. “He’s really hands on, he wants to do as much as he possibly can with the children,” Ellie says. “People are a bit more forgiving of me not being able to do stuff, in comparison to him.” Ellie hopes to take the full six months of proxy votingre-elected so she can avoid taking baby Thomas into Parliament - and thinks new mum MPs should be entitled to a full year. “I’m very happy to do constituency stuff, I’m doing that now, it doesn’t really ever stop and that’s part and parcel of the job,” she says. “But because of the unsociable hours of Parliament and because it’s not on the doorstep, I don’t want to go back to late night voting when he’s six months old. “Outside of the Westminster bubble people are entitled to  months of maternity leavethey want to, and as lawmakers I think we should lead by example. To have to go back to late night voting with a very smnall baby to me is just out of step with maternity legislation. “And in terms of encouraging more women to put themselves forward, and being a more modern workplace, it’s totally out of step with that.” Ellie, whose sister Rachel is also standing for re-election, hopes that MPs will eventually be able to share parental leave. “It should be an option, whether it’s something we’d take advantage of I’m not sure,” she says.  She hopes Parliament will bring in deferred isions so parents of young children can vote in the morning, rather than late at night. “One of the problems is the unpredictability. I can remember one occasion when I was pregnant and was told at pm that the votes could run until any hour. “I was pregnant, had really bad nausea and a bladder infection and a four-year-old in nursery and I basically called my mum in tears”. But the Labour politician was back at work planning her election campaign after just one day of maternity leave.“I was struggling to travel and to commute and then of course we voted for a general election ,” she says.“I felt a bit sick to be honest. I just thought this is terrible. The baby was due in a couple of days and I just thought I have so much to sort out. “Everyone says don’t worry because other people can do stuff for you. But actuallyleaflets are going out in my name I have to be able to sign all that off and sort out the content. So immediately I had loads of work to do.”  In the end, baby Thomas was eight days late and Ellie says it was “just as well” as it gave her time to get everything signed off. She was out campaiging until the day before her contractions began - and says her constituents’ reaction was very positive. “Whenever I went out I had my hospital bag in the boot of the car,” she says. Thomas, who has an older brother Albert, was born in Lewisham Hospital’s maternity unit which was “absolutely amazing, really brilliant”. Ellie has no plans to follow another new political mum, Stella Creasy, who has appointed a locum MP to handle her casework. “Nobody can stand in my place in Parliament - speak in debates or do my committee work. It’s the case work and office management and I’ve got a fantastic office manager. I’m confident that I have a really strong team.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man born without arms legs","story":"NewsMan born without arms or legs ordered to prove he cant work three times in a yearEXCLUSIVE Kevin Donnellon has had to fill in three fit to work questionnaires for the Department of Work and Pensions this year - despite having been born without limbs due to thalidomideShareCommentsByPhil Cardy:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsKevin Donnellon was born without arms or legs \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Thalidomide survivor Kevin Donnellon, , has had to complete “intrusive” -page booklets from the Department for Work and Pensions in order to keep receiving benefits. Kevin said: “It’s not like my arms and legs have grown.” The dad-of-two was one of around , UK babies affected by the morning sickness drug Thalidomide. Fewer than  have lived past .  Kevin has battled to live as normal a le as he can, getting a degree in social sciences and working with adults with learning disabilities. But he is fighting deteriorating health. He said: “My last paid job was  years ago. Now I’m not as healthy.I’ve got severe backache from the articial legs I used to wear – they weren’t the fantastic prosthetics you get these days. I’ve also got type  diabetes.  “This government seems to have targeted disabled people. I have a lot of disabled friends who are terried when they get these letters they’re going to have benefits taken away. “Twice in the last year I’ve had to fill in questionnaires. Now I’ve a third, due back on December . Merry Christmas. It feels vindictive. The questions are intrusive, very personal. “I was born like this – you’d think my details would be on the system.” Kevin, of Liverpool, had to fill out a form for PIP payments to replace his Disability Living Allowance, and two “capability for work” forms for Universal Credit , to replace Employment and Support Allowance. He said: “I’ve worked in the past, but I can’t do anything full-time. All these cuts are simply cruel.” The DWP said the reassessments were part of the transition from DLA to PIP and those with le-long conditions would then only have “light-touch” -year reviews.  A spokesman added: “Mr Don­nellon has been awarded ESA indefinitely following a recent reassessment, and the highest rate of PIP with a light-touch review in  years.” Meanwhile, Tory candidate Sally-Ann Hart has been blasted for saying it is right to pay people with learning dficulties less than minimum wage as they “don’t understand money”. Ms Hart, standing in Hastings and Rye, was defending a post she shared that said the “therapeutic benefit” of working was better than pay.

But it’s not one that anyone who considers themselves a democrat should be proud of. The “winning party” in all recent elections, and this is the third in five years, is the DVs – the Don’t Voters.They represent more than either Labour or Tory.Around a third of those eligible and registered to vote can’t be bothered to place their X in the box. Whether it’s cynicism, apathy, ­arrogance, laziness or none of the above, a potentially decisive number of people are, by historical standards, expected to check out of making a choice in an election which will shape the future of Britain for a generation. Just by not checking in. It could make such a dferencethey, or even a proportion of them, did.Take Boris Johnson ’s own seat of Uxbridge. He held it with what would once have been seen as a safe majority of , after , voters plumped for him at the ballot box in .  But almost as many – , of registered voters – did not take part. That’s just  fewer than voted for Mr Johnson. No wonder Labour ­activists are pouring in to unseat a sitting Prime Minister for the first time since . Uxbridge is just outside the  seats where there are more DVs than people who voted for the sitting MP.  And in  of Parliament’s  seats –  per cent – the number of DVs exceeds the majority of the sitting MP. If these figures don’t cause alarm you are ­probably one of those don’t-care DVs. In too many cases –  million – voters live in seats that haven’t changed hands since the last world war. So people think their vote doesn’t, or won’t, make a ­dference. They have a point. But in many cases their votes really could make a dference. In  seats, a potentially prevailing majority in a possible hung Parliament, the majority is fewer than  votes.  Proportional representation has been raised as a solution. But when that was put to the vote in a  referendum it was decisively rejected on a turnout of  per cent. Compulsory voting has been floated as a solution to voter turnout, which is in decline. Of  countries where it applies – including Australia, Austria and Belgium – only half enforce it.

The Conservatives are investigating after Sally-Ann Hart, who is standing as a Tory candidate in Amber Ruddaposs former Hastings and Rye seat, shared a video in  which implied Jewish philanthropist George Soros controls the EU.St Helens South and Whiston candidate Richard Short questioned in a tweet in  whether journalist Melanie Phillipsaposs allegiance was to the UK or Israel.And Lee Anderson, who is running in Ashfield and Eastwood, is said to be an active member of a Facebook group where Soros conspiracies are promoted.A Conservative Party spokeswoman said: These matters are being investigated. Discrimination or abuse of any kind is wrong, and the Conservative Party takes decisive action to deal with any incidents of hatred, abuse or intimidation. We are committed to stamping out the scourge of anti-Semitism in our society and supporting our Jewish community. Our complaints process is rightly a confidential one but there are a wide range of sanctions to challenge and change behaviour, including conditions to undertake training, periods of suspension and expulsion, and these are applied on a case-by-case basis. Andrew Gwynne, Labouraposs national campaign co-ordinator, said: Johnson must answer for the anti-Semitism being promoted in his name. One Conservative candidate aposlikedapos a Nazi slogan, another candidate promotes a group named after Johnson which peddles anti-Semitic Soros conspiracies, and a third candidate accused British Jews of being more loyal to Israel than to the UK, a classic anti-Semitic trope. Boris Johnson said members who make racist comments are aposout first bounceapos. So why is he refusing to suspend these three candidates, none of whom appear to have apologised  Johnson has never called out and condemned anti-Semitic Soros narratives among his supporters. On the contrary, the Conservatives whipped their MEPs to vote in support of the Hungarian government which peddles the Soros conspiracy and appointed a senior government adviser who promotes this narrative. Anti-Semitism is clearly re in the Conservative Party from top to bottom.  Ms Hart sparked uproar after she appeared to back a plan to let people with learning disabilities work for less than the minimum wage.

He has Sturge-Weber syndrome, which is known for the large aposport wine stainsapos that it causes on the skin of the few affected by it. Bethanie, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, said Oscar recently suffered his first seizures, which are symptoms of the syndrome, including one that lasted  minutes.She told CambridgeshireLive: When he was born we noticed he had quite a large birthmark on his face.The doctors said it could be a birthmark, or bruising because I had quite a traumatic labour. We didnapost know much about Sturge-Weber until he got seen for his jaundice and they explained when babies have birthmarks like Oscaraposs it can be Sturge-Weber. We read up and it said around  per cent of babies that had Sturge-Weber could have seizures, so we were kind of expecting it. That was about four weeks ago, and on Thursday nighthe had his first  minute seizure.  We were expecting it in a way, but you donapost expect it as well. Oscar had a seizure while undergoing an MRI at Peterborough City Hospital. When he was discharged on  November he had a seizure within  minutes of arriving at home and was readmitted after being taken to hospital by ambulance. He was allowed home again on Wednesday. Bethanie said: In a week, heaposs had  seizures and theyaposve just been trying dferent medications.  As he develops, the condition develops with him so itaposs constantly trying to keep up with his medications. Watching Oscar suffer a seizure is an agonising experience for the parents. Bethanie said: You feel kind of helpless, but itaposs something Iaposm going to have to get used to. Itaposs not like epilepsy where you can take your medication and go seizure-free.  Itaposs about making them as few and far between as possible. Longer seizures present a risk of brain damage and complications in the future, so Bethanie and Tim need access to specialist equipment that can help them to detect the seizures as soon as possible.Family and friends have launched a GoFundMe page to help to pay for the equipment, raising almost £, after setting an initial target of £.In the future, the parents will have back-and-forth trips to Addenbrookeaposs Hospital in Cambridge and Great Ormond Street Hospital in London to see specialists.

He has raised almost £, through a string of initiatives and now champions the Sunday Mirror’s Home from Home Christmas Appeal in conjunction with the CLIC Sargent charity. You can find Jack at his local Morrisons, Homebase and train station – rattling his collection tin and running raffles and tombolas. It would be extraordinary for any -year-old. Let alone one who is on his seventh course of chemotherapy after a cancer battle that started when he was just four months old. Jack is registered blind and has an inoperable brain tumour. Yet he says: “I know that every single pound makes such a big dference. “I want to do anything I can to make other families dealing with cancer have an amazing Christmas. “Every day I feel so lucky to be here, with so many people to meet and so much I can do to make the world better. “As long as my ‘naughty lump’ stays away, I won’t stop.” Jack is eternally grateful to kids’ cancer charity CLIC Sargent, which has supported him and his family for a decade. Now he is urging Sunday Mirror readers to follow his lead and put their hands in their pockets to keep Christmas magical for families going through similarly tough times. We launched our appeal last month, with donations helping to fund CLIC Sargent accommodation near specialist cancer wards – so that families can be closer to sick kids in hospital. It was four years ago that Jack organised his first event – a family fun day at a local supermarket, raising over £,. He has given up weekends, evenings and birthdays in a relentless series of fundraisers. And he hopes to pass the £, mark by Christmas. Jack does four fundraising “shts” a week on the checkouts at several Morrisons stores near his home in Gateshead.  He also makes appeals over the tannoy at Newcastle Central train station. His beloved nana Elaine McKay, , takes him on his charity runs. She said: “Every single opportunity he can, he’s thinking how he can raise more. He’s even set up a tuck shop at his karate class – he’s literally left no stone unturned.” Three years ago, Jack and his cousin Emma signed up for the Junior Great North Run. Even breaking his toe didn’t stop him completing the course, raising £,. Elaine added: “Jack even managed to get sponsorship from the doctor who was treating his toe. “I took Jack to Blackpool a few weeks ago. “But he didn’t want to go up the tower – he just wanted to find the nearest Morrisons so he could fundraise and help out on the tills.” "},{"url":null,"title":"football fans try storm rival","story":"NewsFootball fans try to storm rival players changing room after penalty shootoutJubilant Irvine Meadow players were confronted by fans of rival Glenafton Athletic after the hosts lost a dramatic penalty shootout in the Scottish Junior Cup at Loch Park in New CumnockShareCommentsByIrvine Herald:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video violent-scenes-fans-attempt-storm-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news football-fans-try-storm-rival-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Kamali Gabbidon-Lynck, , was kned to death in Wood Green after a group of gang-members went out hunting for suspected rivals and set upon their victims like a pack of animals in Wood Green, North London. Police said the culprits, who were carrying machetes, guns and even a sword- kned the two men in a petty postcode rivalry, shooting one, then bragged about their violence online afterwards in drill music videos. Two men and three teenagers were yesterday convicted with murder following a trial following the violent attack on February  that killed the young dad. Kamali was stabbed as he fled from a car he had used to try to distract his attackers while they attacked his -year-old friend, in a desperate manoeuvre that spared his friend but ultimately cost him his own le.  The Met Police released a harrowing clip of the incident following yesterdayaposs convictions, in which men brandishing long knives can be seen spotting their victims before they drop their bicycles and give chase. Tyrell Graham, , of Leyton, and Sheareem Cookhorn, , of Tottenham, were yesterday found guilty of Kamaliaposs murder by a jury. Cookhorn was also found guilty of possession of a firearm with intent.  Three -year-old males who cannot be named for legal reasons were also convicted of Kamaliaposs murder as well as grievous bodily harm with intent in relation to the man who was stabbed and shot. One of the teens was also found guilty of possession of a kne. The jury in the case heard the group had calculated the plan for a violent encounter that night. A Met Police statement outlined how the evening before the attack on Kamali and the other victim, the group had parked a car on Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham. On the night of the murder, the group of seven, which included the five defendants and two unknown men, set off on bicycles toward Wood Green at around pm to search for suspected rival gang-members.  Police said between the five defendants they carried at least five knives, including a machete and a small sword, a handgun and a shotgun. As they approached Lordship Lane near Wood Greenaposs Vue cinema complex, the group spotted Kamali and the other victim, who were with two others. The defendants immediately dropped their bicycles and produced knives and the firearm. Cookhorn fired shots at the victims, but missed. The bullet travelled through an open door of the shop, narrowly missing customers and staff indoor.  The victims’ group prepared for fight but changed their minds and fled when Cookhorn fired his handgun. The defendants began a short chase after the victims, brandishing their weapons. The victims’ group ide into two pairs, with Kamali and the other victim running back towards their parked car, while the other two escaped unharmed. After losing two of the victims, the defendants ed to their bicycles and went back after Kamali and the other man, who had run off in dferent directions. They caught up with their -year-old victim, encircled him, and began viciously attacking him. The attackers stabbed him eight times and shot him once in the buttock.  Meanwhile, Kamali  had managed toto his parked car and drove towards the defendants in a failed attempt to frighten them off. They then turned their attention to Kamali and began to strike the vehicle’s windows and windscreen with their weapons. He tried to escape by reversing his car away but unfortunately got himself stuck when he reversed into several parked cars on Vincent Rd, police said. Surrounded, he decided to flee his car and ran into a hairdresser’s shop across the road hoping to barricade himself inside. However, the defendants followed him inside and stabbed Kamali.  The defendants then fled on their bikes back to their parked car at the Broadwater Farm Estate, where they changed their clothes and left the area. Police were called to the scene at just after pm. The London Ambulance Service’s paramedics rushed to the aid of the two victims and transported them to hospital. Despite doctorsapos best efforts, Kamali was pronounced dead shortly after am on Saturday,  February. Homicide detectives pieced together hundreds of hours of CCTV footage in their investigation to to understand the route taken by the defendants, and used forensic analysis of multiple crime scenes across Wood Green.  Graham was arrested in April, and Cookhorn the following month, followed yb a  -year-old male. Homicide detectives then arrested two then -year-old boys in July. Detective Chief Inspector Simon Stancombe, of Specialist Crime North, said: “So desperate were the defendants to continue their petty postcode rivalry, the gang launched their gun and kne attack outside a busy cinema and several restaurants packed with people and children enjoying their Friday night. “Having chased down Kamali and his friend like a pack of animals they set about them with a ferocity I have rarely seen. Not content with the damage they had caused that night they then boasted about their murderous exploits in amateurish drill videos. “In truth, there are no winners, no bragging rights or anything to be proud of. One man is dead, another has le changing injuries, a family is utterly bereft and five young men will spend the best days of their lives behind bars.

The charity encourages iniduals and businesses to share their time and skills to help improve the lives of others in their community. Construction company Amspec, which is based in Wigan, asked how they could help An Hour For Others - who decided Megan and Tasha deserved a treat. Dad Ken explained: The girls, since they lost their mum, theyaposve been left with a lot of stress and a lot of anger - so sharing a little room at that time was really dficult for them. If they did want to get away, there was nowhere to go for their own space. Being teenagers as well, hormones are everywhere.

Amelia Revitt was just -months-old when she had the first of her epileptic fits which have blighted her le ever since.She turned grey, stopped breathing and was completely unresponsive when her dad tried to revive her, reports WalesOnline .Unfortunately the fits have since become increasingly frequent and by the time she reached school age she was suffering up to  of them every day. Doctors have told her parents that her seizures cannot be controlled with medication, unlike many other sufferers. At times I just want to scream at the doctors to help my child, but thereaposs very little they can do for her, said Ameliaaposs mum Elizabeth Elworthy. The chances are she wonapost make it to her th birthday. Itaposs just so scary. Amelia, now nine, was born at the Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, Wales, just  weeks and five days into Elizabethaposs pregnancy weighing a tiny lb oz. When she was a month old she suffered a very serious stomach infection which almost claimed her le. She needed to be transferred to the neonatal unit at the University Hospital of Wales where her parents stayed by her side for two weeks. It was just horrible. In between our beds on the the parentsapos unit, located just above intensive care, there was a cabinet with a red phone in it, recalled Elizabeth, , from Abercarn, Caerphilly, Wales. We were told it would only ringwe needed to go downstairs to say our goodbyes [to Amelia]. Thankfully it never rang. They gave her loads of antibiotics and she was eventually discharged at three months old.  Despite being allowed home, it was clear to Elizabeth and her then partner Matthew Revitt, , that Amelia wasnapost making great progress. Elizabeth added: We knew sheaposd be a bit delayed in hitting her milestones when it came to things like crawling and walking, but we never thought it was anything to worry about. But just after reaching her first birthday, Amelia suffered her first frightening seizure. She was with her dad in her pushchair waiting for me to come out of college when she stopped breathing, turned grey and was unresponsive, said Elizabeth. It only lasted about  seconds before she started breathing again. However, the same thing happened again in front of Elizabeth two weeks later. She was on her play mat. I went into the kitchen and when I came back she was grey, drooling and unresponsive. I took her straight to hospital, but they put it down to a heat seizure. It was a boiling hot day, but in my gut I knew that wasnapost what caused it.Over the course of the next few years Amelia would  continue to have seizures  every six months, the most severe of which would cause her to shake and convulse. Nevertheless, she was able to go to school, walk, talk and play with her classmates. It was only when she reached the age of five that things began to go downhill fast. She was diagnosed with a type of brain injury known as periventricular leukomalaciawhich causes a softening of white brain tissue and leads to epileptic fits. Despite being given medication to ease the symptoms, poor Amelia began to experience smaller, more frequent seizures. Amelia was doing things like falling asleep in class and couldnapost be woken up, which was unusual for her, said Elizabeth. The doctors decided to carry out an EEG which is used to monitor the electrical activity of the brain. It revealed that, though Ameliaaposs body was showing no outward sign, her brain was almost permanently fitting. I just broke down to the doctors. It was horrendous.  Amelia was put on a high dependency ward at the Noahaposs Ark Childrenaposs Hospital for Wales in Cardf where she remained in a coma for two weeks. Unconvinced that Ameliaaposs severe symptoms matched her PVL diagnosis, her consultant decided to conduct a series of genetic tests. Though the medical team kept trying to find a medication that worked for Amelia during this time, her seizures kept ing. Though she was never as steady on her feet as my other children had been at the same ages, Amelia had been able to make her way around, feed herself and communicate well enough to go to school before the seizures started getting really bad, said Elizabeth, who also has three other children, two of whom also have serious health issues. But each seizure damages her brain a little more and she stops being able to do something she was previously able to. Sheaposs going downhill physically too. Sheaposs partially sighted and partially deaf and her small bowel isnapost ing properly either now. After exhausting all other options, Amelia was diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder known as HNRNPU - a relatively newly discovered condition with only  known cases in the world, all of which are children. While there are many dferent mutations of the disorder, Amelia is thought to be the only child that doesnapost respond to any form of treatment. Elizabeth and Matthew have been warned thatAmelia were to suffer a serious, non-convulsive seizure again, she might not survive it.

The bid to help Rachel Finn has been backed by hundreds including pop star Lily Allen after tearfully telling BBC News crews she had just four p and six p coins to her name. The -year-old was staying in temporary accommodation with her son Bradley when she featured in a report into vulnerable and low-income voters in Grimsby. Her moving story led to an outpouring of support with a JustGiving page set up to support both her and the Rock Foundation foodbank reaching more than £, in a day before donations were closed. Pam Hodge, founder of the foodbank, told Grimsby Live that the money raised will provide much needed security to the food bank as it faces mounting demand for its services. She said: I really cannot believe how this has all taken off, I have just been manic for the past two days dealing with people wanting to make donations and do their bit to help. At the moment, £, has been raised, which will be donated to us and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, so that it can be used to help others. We are going to use £, of it to help Rachel get a new house sorted, with a deposit, along with some furniture and white goods. We will also be supporting some of the other people who were featured in the BBC report. The rest of the money that we receive, will all be used to support the food bank and the hundreds of other people we work with every week.  We will be able to restock our cupboards and even get some presents for local children and families who are struggling at this time of year, which will hopefully help them out a big bit. Last month was a record month for the food bank, as more people were seeking their services than ever, many of whom are employed but their wages just do not stretch far enough. Pam said: Last month we handed out , food parcels from our food bank, which works out at around  a week. The array of people that our needing our support is immense, as we have everything from people struggling on zero hours contracts and universal credit to working professionals who are unable to afford food after paying their bills and asylum seekers. We are just hoping now that these donations will be able to make a real dference to the work that we do. Struggling Rachel toldthat she has suffered from depression  and is currently on Universal Credit.  Rachel had said she was overwhelmed with the support received from cplete strangers. She told Grimsby Live : I really didnapost expect for there to be this sort of reaction to the story, it really has overwhelmed me to the point that I just donapost know what to do. I am not used to people who I have never met before want to help me, and it will take me a bit of time to get my head around it all and process things. If people want to help me though, I ask that it is all done through the Rock Foundation, who are going to help me with food, furniture and housing, and anything after that, they can use to help others and continue the work that they do. Rachel said: My depression got really bad and I wasnapost getting the help I needed. I didnapost get out of the house for three months. I just sat in my bedroom and it just escalated.  Thereaposs a lack of support, getting a doctoraposs appointment was dficult. You just get passed from pillar to post, from council to crisis team, to doctor.  And that gets you even more depressed. You keep telling people your situation and repeating yourself, and getting nowhere. Universal Credit  , which was introduced in  by the Tories, has made it a lot harder, Rachel says. She said: They should never have brought it in, itaposs the worst thing they did. Thereaposs that many people struggling on it. You are getting paid once a month,something happens in the middle of the month, you are in trouble. Itaposs harder to budget.    When it was fortnightly, you didnapost struggle so much or worry so much, you can budget for two weeks at a push, but not monthly.  In another cruel blow, Rachel was punished for missing a job seekeraposs appointment, which she claims she was unaware of because she does not have a phone or an internet connection. She claims her Universal Credit was sanctioned and a large amount being taken from her payment. Rachel added: Iaposm struggling with myself. I cry a lot, mainly when Iaposm on my own. But Iaposm getting there, Iaposve got a lot to focus on, I just donapost have the energy to do it. The mum said her son Bradley, who turns  this month, is the only thing she has to live for. He wanted a bicycle for his birthday, but his mum feared she wouldnapost make his wish come true. She added: As long as my son is eating, I can manage.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teacher who turned to heroin and was jailed for drug ­dealing says her descent into hell could happen to anyone. Angela Davey had been a pupil at a private school and three years ago was a respected special needs teacher. With a husband and two children her le looked close to perfect. But when her marriage started to crumble she took comfort in drugs. Within four months of taking cocaine she was hooked on heroin. And to pay off her drug debts Angela fell in with a gang of county lines dealers. She ended up penniless, living on the streets and on the run from police. Her distraught family appealed for her to turn herself in before she was finally jailed. Last month she was released on licence, having served a third of a -month sentence for conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Today Angela, , is turning her le around after jail brought her to her senses and helped her kick drugs through a methadone programme. She is desperate to reunite with her children, aged ten and eight, and even hopes to become a teacher again. She said: “Getting caught was a ­relief. I had hit rock bottom. It was the ­moment that saved me. I finally had to face my problems.  “I finally felt remorse and realised I handled everything the wrong way. “Three years ago you could say I had this idyllic le. I was academic and hard-working. But I handled trauma that many people experience in their lives very wrong. “Because of drugs I lost ­everything – my children, home, a career I loved, my good name. “All I cared about was the next score. My children know I went to jail. One of my greatest fears is there will be no relationship.” She is bravely sharing her story as a cautionary tale, saying: “It could happen to anyone. A few wrong decisions and I lost control and hit rock bottom.”  After a normal upbringing in Norwich, Angela graduated from the University of East Anglia in  and started a promising career. She married and had two children but became unhappy and developed anxiety and depression. Angela recalled: “I was in a bad place and kept trying to end my marriage My ­husband agreed to a orce in .” The following year, while off work with stress, she met Joseph, an IT repairs consultant and recovering addict, though Tinder. She said: “I can’t ­remember how but we started taking cocaine recreationally. I was using it to feel good because I was low.  “But there was no crossover ­between drugs and work. I never took drugs when my kids were at home.” In early  her husband moved away with her children after winning sole custody because of Angela’s ­behaviour – and she went into a rapid decline. She said: “I started ­taking coke daily with the kids gone. I felt isolated. “One day Joseph and I went to someone’s flat and they askedI’d tried smoking crack. “I thought it would block ­everything out. I liked it. It was intense. “Soon I ­constantly wanted more.” As she lost control, Angela quit work on mental health grounds and in April she turned to heroin. She said: “Dealers told me it would help control cravings for crack. “I’m an intelligent person but by then I only thought short-term – feeding my cravings. I smoked it at my flat and I instantly forgot everything. “Soon I was using it daily. There was a huge element of self-destruct.”  Angela became estranged from her family. At that time, dealers who sold heroin and crack cocaine moved into her home. They were part of a county lines operation ­ferrying drugs between Norwich and London. They paid her rent in “eight bits” – two £ shots of heroin and six of crack. The gang then offered drugs in ­ for hiring out two cars in her name for them to use. She said: “I knew it was wrong but I just wanted drugs. One threatened to tell ­everyone I was an addict so I’d never get my kids back. Another ­threatened my partner with violence. Police arrested three of the ­dealers after a ­surveillance operation. Angela was collared in July.  Released pending an investigation, she ended up sleeping rough in London with boyfriend Joseph. Angela recalled: “I was using drugs wherever, under a bridge or public toilets. “I started begging and shoplting or selling my artwork on the street. “There were scary moments. Once a man offered me money for sex and chased me up an alley.” She was caught shoplting £ of stationery and given a community ­service order. At Norwich crown court in October  Angela ­admitted conspiracy to ­supply Class A drugs then failed to turn up at sentencing. Her drug-ravaged ­image was shared on a national police most-wanted alert. Her father David Wilkes, , begged her to turn herself in. He said: “The Angela Davey the police are looking for is not the Angela Davey who is my daughter.  “She is a loving, caring ­mother. She is a bright girl and her whole le has been totally destroyed. It is not all of her own doing. She is a victim, and she is not the first.” Angela spent four months on the run, living on the streets. She said: “I was terried of what would happenI turned myself in.” But she was finally ­sentenced after being caught ­shoplting again in February this year. Angela was remanded for six weeks at HMP Peterborough and put on a methadone programme. She recalled: “The withdrawal from heroin was horrendous. I couldn’t sleep. My limbs were twitching, I was vomiting and had diarrhoea.” Sentencing her, Judge Katharine Moore said: “You permitted yourself to be drawn into this shadowy world of drugs. The fabric of your le ­unravelled rapidly from .” Her parents came to her sentencing and visited her once in jail.

It was her main passion in le. “She loved her Jimmy Choo shoes and she was bling-tastic. She was known as Mrs Sparkle. “Mum and I were best pals. She and I would hit the town and she was always on the karaoke. “We went on two cruises every year. We were like a real-le version of Ab Fab. She adored her designer labels and her bling so she would start shopping in January and shop all year round for Christmas presents.” Julia, of Pen-y-ffordd, North Wales, lost both her husband Tommy,  and son Carl, , to heart attacks. But she never lost her energy and sense of fun – even when doctors ­diagnosed her with bowel cancer in March last year. Julia ­began chemo but developed sepsis and pneumonia.Her daughter, from nearby Buckley, says: “Mum was amazingly ­upbeat. I dyed her hair dferent colours while she was in the hospital – pink and violet. “Each morning, no ­matter how ill she felt, she made sure I tonged her hair and put her eyelashes on. She had major surgery and when I went to see her in ICU she said, ‘Can you bring my curling tongs ’ That was her main concern. “Some of the nurses dyed their hair pink to match hers. Even when she died, she had pink hair.”  With Christmas approaching, hospital staff warned that Julia might not make it to December . Jules says: “The nurses knew how much mum loved Christmas and so they told us to bring it forward. But I couldn’t do it because I didn’t want mum to know she was dying. “I just prayed she might hang on. All through December she was doing her shopping on her iPad. She was so ­excited.” On Christmas Eve, staff at Clatterbridge Hospital, Wirral, agreed to let Julia spend the th with her ­daughter Jules and son Wayne – just like they used to every year. Jools says: “We were so excited about it. Mum was very weak and we knew she was dying but I was determined to get her home for Christmas. We just couldn’t let her down.  “On Christmas Day we had a strict family rule that everyone had to be at my house by .am on Christmas morning – even when we were all grown up. We’d wear our best designer outfits and really make the most of Christmas.” Staff arranged for a hospital bed to be installed in Jules’s living room. “She had planned a Christmas outfit with high heels but she was too poorly to get dressed,” says Jules. “Even though she was dying, she put her lashes on. I was so choked but so proud as well. She died at home at lunchtime on Christmas Day. I like to think she spent Christmas morning with me and my brother Wayne, and Christmas afternoon with my dad and my brother, in heaven.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailChild poverty is so bad on a Welsh estate that mums live off energy drinks so that their children can eat, it has been reported. The Queensway  area in Caia Park, Wrexham, was recently ranked the th poorest in Wales on a Welsh Government index.The estate, which is home to several families, has faced cuts in services and even the closure of the anti-poverty Communities First scheme in Wrexham, the Daily Post reports.Cllr King, a former Wrexham council leader who runs The Venture playscheme on the estate, said: The most important figures are the child poverty figures released in April which show Caia Park was had the first and second worst areas in Wales. In fact three out of the top four were on the estate. It has been a steady decline, he said. Children are now coming to The Venture, not to play, but to get something to eat because they are starving. They are suffering from malnutrition and its unbelievable thataposs happening in a first world country and we know that children born into poor families are more likely to have health problems. There are no other housing estates in the UK where this happens, it has the largest concentration of child poverty anywhere. Church army officer Chris Lawton said although St Markaposs Church had suffered vandalism, there is a growing sense of community. However he added children have been hungry and the church has launched a Holiday Hunger scheme to feed young people who do not have access to paid school dinners.  Itaposs very sad, he said. We initially only had one or two families turning up at most to our food bank, now we can have - families. Wrexham and Caia park have had a major problem with car arson in recent years and on Brym Eglwys outside the church, the remains of another burned out vehicle stained the road. Although crime levels are high, local Brian Hyde said he feels safe in the area. That is the first incident I have seen on this road in  years, he said: Everbody knows everybody  here and they look out for each other.  Queensway does have its problems, but over here I do feel safe and it is quite quiet. The Given to Shine charity is now delivering half of its  parcels a week to struggling families on Caia Park. We are seeing mums in hospital, she said. They are living off energy drinks just so their children can eat. It is heartbreaking. We have definitely seen a massive increase since the summer months. The little amount people earn is having to spent on energy bills. Working over at The Venture, community councillor Colin Powell said: Not a lot has changed here in the last  years. It does feel as though the estate has been abandoned by Wrexham council. Wrexham is fairly affluent place but Caia Park is not getting the help it needs.  Cllr King added: There are some positives in Caia Park, there is a community spirit, and there are a lot of hard working people, working ridiculous hours an low wages, in jobs that other people would not do. But it needs a large increase in funding to bring it back to where it was years ago and the council could be doing more and the council needs to do more. Wrexham council said in a statement: The council ran the Communities First operation in Caia Park and Hightown between  and , until the closure of the programme. The council has maintained a Communities for Work team based on the Caia Park Estate and in Plas Madoc since this time and this project, funded by European Social Fund is expected to continue to  with funding of £,, confirmed.  This employability support programme was expanded in  with the addition of the WG’s Communities for Work Plus programme, which increased the number of participants eligible for employability support. As per the Communities for Work programme, Communities for Work Plus is delivered across two operations on the Caia Park Estate and in Plas Madoc, and is worth a total of £,. The Legacy Fund was launched for an initial period of   to  , and the council has used this fund to provide andadditional officer to work in each of the Caia Park and Plas Madoc operations, as well as a training budget and barriers fund to further complement the Communities for Work teams, which totals £,. The project is based out of the Caia Park Partnership offices. Through this combination of employability support, more than  people have been supported into paid employment to date. The council also used the Legacy Fund to create and Employability Support Grant worth £,, which was available to previous providers of Communities First services. Applications for financial support were approved for the two  years of the fund from The Venture Playground Ltd. as lead for the Wrexham Youth  Play Partnershipand the Caia Park Partnership.  The council has supported the Caia Park Partnership to secure Asset Transfer arrangements and physical improvements to its buildings on Prince Charles Road, which has led to the creation of the Hwb element of the Partnership and also the extension of the Sparkles Day Nursery, which received funding through the Vibrant  Viable Places Programme. The council is currently supporting the assignment of the lease at the Red Dragon Public House, and planning permission is being sought for its conversion into a new, modern convenience store and is currently working to support the granting of a lease to Wrexham Youth  Play Partnership for the Gwenfro Valley site. We have also used the Enabling Natural Resources and Well-being Grant, worth £,, for Wrexham’s Green Infrastructure Project, based three days per week in Caia Park.  The council identied the Nant Silyn site in Pont Wen, Caia Park for new council house building, and a scheme of  units was approved by planning committee earlier this year. Gwenfro  Hafod y Wern Schools have been modernised   built as part of the  Century School programme with total investment of £,,.

Before and after pictures chart -year-old Jen Elizabethaposs harrowing journey from drug addiction and alcoholism to a clean le of sobriety. The Calornia woman had become an alcoholic at age  after fleeing the cult where she had been molested. Jen, now an author and mum, has shared her experience of learning to process her pain and shed the shackles of addiction in hope of inspiring others to follow her path. Pictures of her recovery journey show her transformation from a woman with a haunted, blemished appearance whose bleak stare is captured in a series of police mugshots to a happy, healthy mum. She has told how addiction and mental illness were key features of her home le as a child. When she was just three years old, her parents joined a religious cult where she was molested until she was nine, when they finally escaped. The years of sexual abuse she endured lured her into a destructive path and she had her first taste of alcohol when she was just  years old, in the form of a bottle of vodka. At first she used booze to find peace, but then progressed to harder drugs. She was in and out of hospitals and became dependent on opiates. Throughout this dark period, she became homeless and was offered her first taste of heroin. She became a frequent user and spent  years in and out of homelessness living in cars and motel rooms, and was arrested many times over drug possession, receiving stolen property and violations of probation.  In , she was in her state prison cell, halfway through her sentence, when she had an epiphany. She decided to get help and turned her le around. Though the road to recovery was a long and challenging process, she re-built her le and set up a daily routine of drinking coffee in the morning, praying, meditating and playing with her two children Gage, six, and Ava, two. Having children has helped her appreciate her le and given her a sense of purpose. She plans to be open with her kids about her journey and believes that you are never apostoo far goneapos to turn your le around.  I was born to a woman who knew nothing about maternal love. She was elusive and abusive mentally, physically and spiritually. She was also an opioid addict, Jen said. I would beg for her love trying to be pretty enough, skinny enough, polite enough for her to even just hug me. I was raised around a lot of sadness and confusion. My parents joined a religious cult when I was three I was molested there until we escaped at age nine.  I was consumed with shame and secrets from my childhood. When I was twelve years old, I found a bottle of vodka It was the first peace I had ever known. I was an alcoholic from that age on. Jen said of her drug-using years: At that point in my le I didnapost care about myself or my le at all. I became an IV heroin user and spent around thirteen years in and out of homelessness, living in cars and dirty motel rooms, in and out of jail desperate and destitute. I hated myself I had never faced my sexual abuse or the abuse I suffered in my home. I thought I was worthless, dirty and unlovable.  I was a slave to my addiction. I did anything and everything I needed to in order to survive, to stay well, to silence the shame in my heart. Each time I was arrested it was humiliating and terrying because I knew the withdrawal I would soon be suffering.  She said the epiphany in prison felt like a ine intervention: All the sound left my cell and a sensation came over me, she said. A tiny spark was ignited that finally believed just a little bit that I was worth more than that le, that I wasnapost meant to die alone from an overdose in some riverbed as a transient whose identication was pending.  Itaposs been a long road addiction had filled every fibre of my being. I had to learn how to be a human to shower and make my bed, how to talk to people and go to the shops. Iaposve had a lot of healing work on my childhood trauma, which is the root to all of my problems. I had to learn that none of that was my fault or my burden to bear.She said her children had been the inspiration to get clean.  Being a mum has definitely made it clear about what kind of home I wanted to raise my children in. They are little still, but I plan on having very open communication with them about the lessons Iaposve learned in le. I want them to know that nothing they ever do will make me love them any less and that anyone can turn anything around.

The -year-old women are fused together at the torso, with each controlling one side of their body. They learnt to work as one - walking and doing daily tasks that many thought they would never manage. But the pair have appeared in their own reality show and flourished into aspiring adults, claiming that although they have one body, they have two souls. Born on March , , in Minnesota, USA, their parents Patty and Mike had no idea they were even expecting twins. Doctors later realised that the twinsapos heads must have been perfectly aligned during the ultrasounds during Parryaposs pregnancy to give the appearance of a normal fetus developing. With poor prognosis at the time for conjoined twins, the girls were not expected to survive even the first night. But they have flourished, even going on to university where they achieved separate degrees.According to Time magazine the girls were born with five limbs - an extra arm growing between their heads - but this was removed during infancy.Although they discussed their options parents Patty and Mike never considered separating the girls, fearing that they would die or be left with severe disabilitiesit was attempted. Instead they encouraged the girls to develop their own minds.  Speaking when they were older, Abby said: We never wish we were separated because we would never be able to do all the things that we do now, like play softball, run and do sports. On their th birthday they passed their driving test - with both of them behind the wheel. Brittany told the Daily Mail at the time: Abby does the pedals and the gear shter. I take over the blinkers and the lights. But she likes driving faster than me. Speaking to the Daily Mirror back in  as their reality show began, the pair hoped it would prove to the world that they are totally dferent people with unique personalities, who share dreams of marriage and having children of their own. But they werenapost prepared to talk about their love le back then.  Brittany, the joker of the two, said: “The whole world doesn’t need to know who we are seeing, what we are doing and when we are going to do it. But believe me, we are totally dferent people.” Abby, the feisty stubborn one, added: “Yeah, we are going to be mums one day, but we don’t want to talk about how it’s going to work yet.” The pair graduated from Bethel University, each with their own degree, as they headed off for a career in teaching. They are now fth-grade teachers in the US, but they reportedly only get one salary. Speaking to the BBC, Abby said: Obviously right away we understand that we are going to get one salary because weaposre doing the job of one person.  As maybe experience comes in weaposd like to negotiate a little bit, considering we have two degrees and because we are able to give two dferent perspectives or teach in two dferent ways. With Brittany adding: One can be teaching and one can be monitoring and answering questions. So in that sense we can do more than one person.

Thousands are hacked to death with machetes in front of baying onlookers. The bloodbath takes place every five years to appease a Hindu goddess at the Gadhimai Temple in Nepal. Pictures taken by an animal welfare charity show mangled remains of buffalo, goats and poultry in Bariyarpur village,  miles south of Kathmandu. Alokparna Sengupta, of Humane Society International, told us: “Animal after animal had their heads lopped off, butchers hacking away at their necks and the corpses twitching away afterwards. “As I watched terried baby buffalo being dragged to their death, I was filled with anger. Our team went back to visit the ­aftermath today and the air was thick with the stench of blood, ­rotting flesh, animal and human faeces, and garbage. “In the main temple arena where the majority of buffalo are slaughtered, the ground is littered with the animals’ ­severed heads, skin and entrails.” Mums and dads even bring toddlers and children to see the sickening scenes.  “We witnessed parents showing their children the mounds of severed heads of buffalo in the arena,” said Ms Sengupta. “To normalise such extreme violence for children is very troubling. “These children are being taught that abusing animals in this way is normal.” The charity wants animal lovers ­worldwide to help force the Nepalese government to enforce a ban. “It is crucial that the scale and the horror of this massacre is seen so that we can bring pressure to bear to end it,” added Ms Sengupta.  Locals believe the tradition dates back  years to when a farmer was told in a dream that spilled blood would encourage Gadhimai, Hindu goddess of power, to solve his problems. Devotees now flock to the temple in the belief it will bring good fortune. Global outrage sparked an official crackdown, which has led to a steep decline in the number of animals killed but has failed to stamp it out. Half a million are thought to have been sacriced in , and , at the next event in . This year an estimated , buffalo, goats and poultry were butchered at last week’s two-day festival.  Volunteers helped officials seize ­hundreds destined for slaughter at the border, but many more were smuggled to the festival in filthy conditions. Traditionally the Dalit – India and Nepal’s lower classes – clear the ­carcasses for meat after the festival. But this year the temple is believed to have raked in huge profits by ­selling them to meat ­buyers. Just  per cent of the animals’ remains were given to the caste. People are being urged to sign a petition opposing the mass slaughter ahead of the next event in . About , Brits visit Nepal every year.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNorth Korea has carried out what state media have called a very\u2028 important test at its Sohae satellite launch site. The reported test has concerned nuclear affairs experts as denuclearisation talks between Pyongyang and the United States appear to remain stalled. The test was carried out at a rocket testing ground that US officials once said North Korea had promised to close.\u2028 State media did not clary what was tested, but observers suspect it was likely a test of an engine to power a satellite launcher or a show of its ability to launch long-range missiles. It comes as a year-end deadline North Korea\u2028h has imposed nears, warning it could take a new path. \u2028The KCNA report called it a successful test of great\u2028 signicance on Saturday but did not specy what was tested. South Koreaaposs defence ministry said the country and the US are cooperating closely in monitoring activities\u2028 at major North Korean sites including Tongchang-ri, the area\u2028 where Sohae is located.\u2028 It comes after the hermit stateaposs leader Kim Jong-un was pictured riding a white horse up North Koreaaposs tallest peak, Mt Paektu. The mountain is celebrated as totemic of Korean revolution and the birthplace of Mr Kim’s father, and the propaganda spectacle marked the second symbolic ride by the leader this year. Mr Kim is said to visit historic sites on the mountain ahead of major decision-making. State media reported that his horse-ride up the peninsulaaposs highest peak was aimed at instilling a ‘revolutionary spirit’ in the people, amid the continued tensions between Pyongyang and Washington DC over denuclearisation talks.  Missile experts said it appeared likely the North Koreans\u2028 had conducted a static test of a rocket engine, rather than a\u2028 missile launch, which are usually quickly detected by\u2028 neighbouring South Korea and Japan.\u2028 If it is indeed a static engine test for a new solid or\u2028 liquid fuel missile, it is yet another loud signal that the door\u2028for diplomacy is quickly slamming,it isnapost already, said\u2028 Vipin Narang, a nuclear affairs expert at the Massachusetts\u2028 Institute of Technology in the US.\u2028 This could be a very credible signal of what might await\u2028 the world after the New Year.  Tensions have risen ahead of a year-end deadline set by\u2028 North Korea, which has called on the US to change its\u2028 policy of insisting on Pyongyangaposs unilateral denuclearisation\u2028 and demanded relief from punishing sanctions.\u2028 On Saturday North Koreaaposs ambassador to the United Nations\u2028 said denuclearisation was now off the negotiating table with the\u2028 United States and y talks with Washington are not needed. The test is the latest in a string of statements and actions\u2028 from North Korea designed to underscore the seriousness of its\u2028 deadline.\u2028 North Korea has announced it would convene a rare gathering\u2028 of top ruling-party officials later this month.  Such meetings and propaganda displays like Mr Kimaposs horse-ride often come ahead of\u2028 major announcements from the stateaposs authorities.\u2028 While North Korea has not specied what its new path\u2028 could be, observers have suggested the launch of a space\u2028 satellite is a possibility. They say that would allow Pyongyang to demonstrate\u2028 and test its rocket capabilities without resorting to overt\u2028 military provocation such as an intercontinental ballistic\u2028 missile launch.\u2028 Such testing is meant to improve military capabilities and\u2028 to shore up domestic pride and legitimacy, Le-Eric Easley, a\u2028 professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said of Saturdayaposs test.\u2028 North Korea is avoiding violations of its long-range\u2028 missile test moratorium for now, but it is still improving the\u2028 propulsion and precision of its missiles so that it can claim a\u2028 credible nuclear deterrent, he said.\u2028 US President Donald Trump told reporters in June \u2028 after his first summit with Mr Kim that\u2028 North Korea had pledged to dismantle one of its missile\u2028 installations, which U.S. officials later identied as Sohae.\u2028  Shortly after that summit, analysts said satellite imagery\u2028 showed some key facilities at Sohae being dismantled.\u2028 However, in the wake of the second summit between Trump and\u2028 Mr Kim earlier this year, which ended with no agreement, new\u2028imagery indicated the North Koreans were rebuilding the site.\u2028 "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/19720246-867x564.jpg ","title":"arbroath 1 1 dundee dark blues winless run extends to four thanks to bobby linns curler","story":"Dundee continue to toil for form in the Championship as they were held to a - draw at a wet and windy Arbroath.Bobby Linn and Kane Hemmings exchanged goals in each half as the Dark Blues failed to win for the fourth match in a row and trail the play-off spots by two points.Dundee boss James McPake made two changes to his XI after last week#s defeat to Queen of the South as Danny Johnson came in to partner Kane Hemmings in attack.

However, Hibs’ defence got back quickly and the Dons were forced to work the ball wide before Considine flashed a tasty cross along the home side’s six-yard line.Soon after, Gallagher came close to finding Cosgrove  yards out after getting in behind on the right, but Porteous stretched to get a toe on the pass.North-east native Martin Boyle had a drive from  yards deflected wide for Hibs on  minutes as the game settled into middling quality tit-fot-tat.On  minutes Marciano made an impressive double stop from Wilson at the near post – after the former Manchester United man had headed the ball round Paul Hanlon – and then Cosgrove on the rebound from  yards.Before the break, Ferguson – who’d shown increasing frustration with referee Colin Steven’s decisions to award Hibs several fouls in Aberdeen’s half – was booked for a challenge on Scott Allan when the home player was deep in his own half.After the interval, Florian Kamberi quickly hit a close-range shot across goal and over the bar.However, Hibs were ahead on  minutes. Scott Allan picked out the run of Boyle, who’d left Considine behind and subsequently drove away from McKenna, rounded Lewis and tap into the empty net.The opener served to lt the home side, who looked like scoring another.McInnes made a triple change on  minutes – with Ryan Hedges, Curtis Main and Dean Campbell coming on for Wilson, Vyner and Logan, and shting to a --.But Hibs soon scored another.Florian Kamberi played a one-two with Melker Hallberg before playing a killer ball through a big gap in the Dons backline to Boyle.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph. On hearing this, I took a short journey to Clovenfords and was delighted to locate ldquothe white house just before the bend which is where the McVeys apparently resided.Like many such encounters, only a smattering of memories remain but a little stardust goes a long, long way."},{"url":null,"title":"jane-fiona-become-queens-nurses","story":"A#CARE home nurse and a learning disability nurse have both been awarded#the prestigious title of Queenrsquos Nurse.##Jane Douglas, Chief Executive at Queenrsquos House in Kelso, and Fiona Mason, a senior charge nurse within the Scottish Borders Learning Disability Service, were selected earlier this year to take part in a nine-month development programme run by the Queenrsquos Nursing Institute Scotland.##Both were nominated#by their employers for providing high quality, compassionate care to people in their communities.#After completing the programme successfully,#they were awarded the historic Queenrsquos Nurse title along with  other community nurses at a ceremony in Edinburgh on Thursday.###Jane has been with Queenrsquos House for around three years and was appointed Chief Executive in April.The charity, which employs approximately  staff, has two care homes - Queens House and Murray House.Jane said: ldquoI have worked in care home nursing for many years across a range of roles before I was lucky enough to get my current job.\"I love where I am now - I am where I am meant to be.ldquoMy aim is that people experience le in a care home positively, that they have a voice and they are able to be autonomous as much as they can be.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually. There is a lot of work going on, but I think we can do more.The next general elections hustings are set to take place on Monday.At .am, BBC Scotland will host a hustings at Heart of Hawick, while in the evening a second hustings, organised by Selkirk Community Council, will take place at Victoria Halls, Selkirk, at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"musical-instruments-ready-collect-peebles-high","story":"MUSICAL instruments left behind after last weeks fire are now ready to collect.All instruments have been collected from Peebles High School after the fire which has forced the High School to close until after Christmas.The instruments have been transported to Priorsford Primary School and will be available until pm today .Scottish Borders Council are making arrangements for further opportunities to collect belongings and instruments tomorrow , details of which will be released in due course.For all updates on the fire, visithttps:www.scotborders.gov.uk PHSfireHave you been impacted by the fire  Get in touch.

Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him.

issues include legalising brothels which Mr Bishop argues will make it safer for women, imposing a speed limit on cyclists using footpaths and improving daytime television.Mr Bishop stood in the

Whitwood at the front --It has  candidates contesting the General Election right across Yorkshire, which is nearly double that of their first general election in .Mr Whitwood said the party is seen as

many years Westminster has let down the people of Yorkshire and the north of England as a whole, he told the PA news agency.ldquoTherersquos a feeling that Yorkshire does deserve better.Mr Whitwood pointed to the recent floods in the area as an example of how the area has been neglected while the South East is favoured.ldquoTwo years ago the Government was told flood defence spending plans favoured the South East and then when the floods did hit it took days for the prime minister to recognise that it was a national emergency by which time whole towns were under water, people were

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate. The same chocolate bar shersquod chosen with glee in the grotto.ldquoThank you, said John and the girl left with her dad.Johnrsquos old friend was now silent. The food van arrived and he packed the chocolate under his jacket.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-saw-poverty-shocked-core-glasgow-1970s-worse","story":"My worst fear is a Tory majority which will almost certainly herald a No Deal BrexitJohnson sticks to his no extension pledge when even he is unable to magic the withdrawal agreement into a trade deal within his timescale.My best hope, a hung Parliament, there to nip his ankles and stymie in part the madness that is bound to unfold.Like many of you Brexit has become a background to daily le, as has did the run up to the election.

Uh  This is a very surprising question considering we can both see she is holding in her actual hands, so close that I can savour their deliciousness, the two actual pasta dishes that I actually, er, ordered.ldquoEr, yes, I say. And suddenly. Without a word. She turns and leaves. Taking my pasta away. Back deep into the bowels of this staggeringly huge restaurant which tonight, a Wednesday, is absolutely heaving, jumping, packed-full, people talking, eating, gesturing, some still waiting at the door, queueing. Pastas being forked, flipped, slurped, dripped, even dropped while mine is leaving on a bloody jet plane. Donrsquot know when it will be back again.ldquoWTF Irsquom in the middle of saying to absolutely nobody because tonight, Matthew, Irsquom eating all alone. At a tiny leper table near the entrance.Then another waitress spots my speech bubble and chases the first one down. A discussion takes placehellipthe pasta still inching stubbornly towards that massive open kitchen so far away, so obscured by standing, sitting, yapping, eating humanity that not once tonight will I get a clear view of it.Hang on, the pastas are swinging back again. Returning. Bobbing, weaving, arriving in a crash landing before me, no explanation, or apology from the first waitress. A wry smile from the second. Sigh.As a result of this mad episode Irsquom going to have to order another pasta later because one thing about pasta that is an absolute fact  It needs to be piping hot when it gets to the table. Steam rising, sauces still sliding, slithering and slipping into shape. And this definitely ainrsquot.Still, Sugo here is the searingly hottest ticket in town. The owners of the undoubtedly brilliantly successful Paesano restaurants trying to do that impeccably-sourced, authentically made and astonishingly cheap thing they did with pizza to pasta.Crikey, fresh hand-made pasta  On this scale: Revolutionary. They donrsquot even eat that in Italy. Only kidding, though outside the home itrsquos nowhere near as available as you would think. For good reasons, not least that the dried stuff is pretty great anyway, and not nearly as risky to handle.What is it like then  Honestly  A hit and a good few misses. Little origami parcels of agnolotti, stuffed with nicely balanced veal, potato and cavallo nero, draped in salty buttery thyme  Pleasant, reasonably good pasta.Then a Jamie Oliver-esque bowl-shaped dome of fine-ish tagliarini, all speckled with reds and green, crumbled with pangratto, pretty, hot with chilli and sold at an almost unbelievable fiver  Hmm. Dry, utterly tasteless, a little sticky in parts and disappointing but also fabulously meaty, superbly deep ragu, chunks of unctuous beef, the pappardelle pasta folded like ribbons of silk, probably the most suitable for serving freshly-made of the dishes Irsquoll have tonight. Itrsquos very good, though a few strands are stuck together. But this I would definitely have again.Now, Irsquod heard they have a problem with portion sizes in here. And I think they already know that. The waitress certainly told me right off that servings are  grams, so maybe three plates for two people. Strange.Surprising, then, to see that  grams on the plate looks like itrsquos way more than enough. A big portion but in the same way pasta doesnrsquot hold its heat like pizza, pasta doesnrsquot fill like pizza. And I find I can easily handle another dish just to see what itrsquos like when served piping hot.The spaghetti, then, with clams and white wine. Theyrsquore good at the sauces in here, definitely, but that springy, bouncy, under this light yellowy, curly spaghetti  That looks like the awful stuff they sell in bags in supermarkets. I donrsquot warm to it. At all. Dried pasta, at Molisana say, would have been better.Despite all this: what Sugo are trying is actually, genuinely, pretty revolutionary. Some of it I think they have got wrong but maybe enough of the whole package they have got right.Sugo Pasta Mitchell StreetGlasgowNo bookingsMenu: Itrsquos pasta but not as you know it ndash all freshly made this very day and thatrsquos a pretty revolutionary and hugely interesting idea.  Service: Itrsquos all a bit bish-bosh, tables being shouted, people being shunted and I had a very odd experience, probably because I was eating alone and ordered two dishes.  Atmosphere: Absolutely bursting with the excitement and anticipation of the moment and all the more fun to be there. Great vibe.  Price: Just like their Paesano pizza restaurants the secret weapon is the fabulously clever pricing with a bowl of tagliarini from just a fiver, and most dishes under a tenner.  Food: Great concept, very good sauces, the fresh pastas are a hit or a miss and possibly need an overall rethink but as this is a brave, new world, I hope they succeed.

Few of us,we were being honest, really believed these were lies exaggeration: perhaps grandstanding: definitely, but not a deliberate attempt to swap a known hood for a universally-accepted fact.As the  General Election campaign enters its final week it is now routinely described by commentators and politicians alike as \"rancorous\", \"unpleasant\" and \"bitter\". In truth, though, itrsquos not really been much more obnoxious than most others in our letimes. Social media tends to amply prickliness and makes it monstrous. That which we once considered only to be disagreeable now becomes disgusting. Perhaps this is what happens when thousands of us now find we can take to the stage and think that only by shouting the loudest can our voices be heard in a crowded market-place.What has made this election unique in my letime is how simplistic to an almost insulting degree has been the offering of the UK Government. When the optimistic investment numbers and shaky NHS promises are stripped away it comes down to one slogan: Get Brexit Done.This flies on the deception that our withdrawal from the EU can be wrapped up before the Christmas trees come down and that everything will be back to normal before next summer. It omits to provide the truth of the two yearsof tough negotiations with a sullen EU on future trading arrangements conducted on a painstaking case-by-case, sector-by-sector basis. It asks us to accept that the US will be falling over itself to be charitable in cutting a beneficent trade deal. It long ago ceased even trying to deny predictions of economic hardship in Britainrsquos most disadvantaged communities. It dismisses concerns that any part of the NHS will be on the table when the Americans come knocking. Aye, right! These may not be outright lies but they rely on concealing all relevant data to those who are most at risk from its adverse effects.If it prevails on December  the duplicitous and infantile nature of Boris Johnsonrsquos personal manesto will make the isions between Scotland and England deeper than they have ever been. Even in this age when we are too ready to reach for extremes and ultimates the dferences have become a chasm. By the time this one is over six elections will have been conducted in Scotland since , encompassing Holyrood, Westminster, local authorities and the European Parliament. The previous five have all ed resounding victories for the SNP campaigning for self-determination and, latterly, a second referendum on independence. This one will follow that pattern. Wersquove also had a referendum on membership of the EU which overwhelmingly rejected what Englandrsquos heart desires. This though, only hints at the cultural, philosophical and political chasm which now exists between Scotland and our great southern neighbours across more sectors than we could ever have previously imagined.This is not to say that Scotland is better than England or that we hold ourselves to a higher moral standard merely that the governments either country has chosen to represent its peoplersquos aspirations regard humanity and human existence in starkly dferent ways. In Scotland our political instincts and legislation is geared towards providing options for the poor, the vulnerable, the excluded and those fleeing terror in other countries. In England, the Boris Johnson optionis to gain power at any cost and to hold it with every artice at his disposal. It discourages speaking truth to power but submerges truth with power.It relies on the confidence that comes with knowing that the main mass media outlets are strictly controlled by a handful of those whose best material interests are served by him or who attended the same school as him. He knows that no-one will look under the bonnet or ask for his workings. It constructs  enemies at home and abroad and stitches them up as the culprits for ills both real and imagined. As the challenges of Brexit begin to bite in those communities least equipped to deal with them the EU is already in the crosshairs of the backlash when it comes.In Scotland there can be valid criticism of the Scottish Governmentrsquos stewardship of the NHS and education but there are key dferences of attitude in these landscapes. In Scotland we want them to deliver for as many as possible and with no exceptions and the failures are of management and civil service incompetence. In Boris Johnsonrsquos England health is being set up to fail and thus to attract the predators of private equity.The great and humane system of care as devised by a great Welshman in England can now only be seen in Scotland. Here, a child has access to  hours of early learning and nursery care, saving families more than pound. In Scotland our students are provided with free tuition while those in England must find almost pound, a year. Prescriptions and care for the elderly are free. In Scotland we want to make the journey from the cradle to the grave as long and as comfortable as possible. In England in the grip of the Johnson regime the same journey will become shorter and more brutal as Brexit and Americarsquos big pharmaceutical companies gather to feed.By all means letrsquos get Brexit donethat is what England truly desires but let it soon be followed by Scottish independencewe truly desire decency and compassion."},{"url":null,"title":"peter-pan-house-one-worlds-coolest-places","story":"Moat Brae, where author JM Barrie played as a child, has long been credited as the place where he gained the inspiration to write the timeless childrenrsquos classic.Now the Georgian property has been named as one of the ldquocoolest places in the world to visit by Time magazine following its multi-million reinvention as Scotlandrsquos new National Centre for Storytelling and Childrenrsquos Literature.The house, in Dumfries, was selected as one of the  sites around the globe children must see.The building was saved from demolition a decade ago and has now been restored as an international visitor attraction.A campaign by the Peter Pan Moat Brae Trustto raise pound million for the renovation was spearheaded by actress and trust patron Joanna Lumley, and the house, which opened in the summer, now features on Timersquos Worldrsquos Coolest Places list for .The magazine said it had based its selections on ldquoquality, originality, sustainability, and accessibility.Describing Moat Brae, it said: ldquoIn , Moat Brae reopened as Scotlandrsquos National Centre for Childrenrsquos Literature and Storytelling.ldquoKids can run through the buildingrsquos enchanted gardens, enjoy the Lost Boysrsquo tree house and board a full-scale pirate ship.

There has also been extensive peatland restoration completed on Garrogie and Corriegarth estates near Inverness.Projects have also taken place on Farr and Glenmazeran in the Monadhliath Mountains.

Robbie Douglas Miller, owner of The Hopes, said: ldquoWe wholeheartedly support the Precious Places campaign, as moors play a crucial role in all our lives by providing multiple benefits for people and nature.

They have previously arranged symposiums on the Pet Shop Boys and Grace Jones.The reason they have chosen to focus on Bush, he explained, is because she is ldquocompletely unique.He added: ldquoShe is incredibly curious, intellectually speaking. A lot of her work takes reference from other art forms. Wuthering Heights would be a great example of that.ldquoThroughout her career shersquos been influenced by literature, shersquos been influenced by cinema, shersquos been very powerfully influenced by dance and modern choreography. The only two tours shersquos done to date are both incredibly theatrical performance art-based works in and of themselves.ldquoThere are so many dferent facets to her. In technological terms and gender-based terms she has been a pioneer ndash one of the first women to take control of her career in the sense of taking a lead production role on her records.ldquoApart from the quality and complexity of the songwriting on albums like The Dreaming, The Hounds of Love and The Sensual World, just how she was using the recording studio at that time is a real inspiration.ldquoThose albums still remain a landmark in terms of how you use new technology to create particular kinds of sounds, he added.:Herald Diary -Kate Bush on the binsIf anything, he believes, her long absence from public view after the birth of her son Albert in  only increased the publicrsquos interest in her. ldquoPopular interest and celebration of her and her achievements has, in my mind, only intensied over the years since she came back with [album] Aerial in .ldquoShersquos been such an innovative and non-conformist artist.

His paper, How Beautul It Is, Amongst All the Rubbish, will discuss the notion of Englishness in Kate Bushrsquos work.ldquoThe first thing people would associate with Kate Bushrsquos Englishness would probably be her reputation for eccentricity, Mr Love says. ldquoI couldnrsquot think of too many other national cultures that would give us something like Wuthering Heights as a breakout single.ldquoPersonally, though, I think the most important aspect of her Englishness runs deeper and has to do with the omnipresent nature of the countryside, standing in as a semi-magical and totally prelapsarian space of fantasy and innocence, in her music.:Review -Six Plays Inspired by the Songs of Kate Bush,ldquoI think that sense of spiritual reverence for place has a long history in English art and is one of the most prominent ways in which England is mythologised as a site of folklore and mysticism ndash itrsquos right there in the pagan woodland in Hounds of Love, the sequestered garden of Under the Ivy and the living, breathing country of Oh England, my Lionheart.The symposium will open on the same day as the General Election. ldquoWe will be having lsquoVote Katersquo badges made for all delegates, Mr Murray revealed. ldquoRegardless of political affiliations and disagreements we will all be presenting a united front with our lapel badges.A Kate Bush Symposium takes place at ECA, December -.

American Express Shop Small found that % of Scots said they would be more environmentally-friendly this Christmas.Presents wrapped in newspaper, energy-saving fairy lights and living trees. This yearrsquos Christmas has become, for many, about sustainability. And thatrsquos hardly surprising. Although it is a festival of consumerism, Christmas has also always been a time of reflection on what we can do to make the world a better place.Some of our great traditions are having to be rethought in this time of climate emergency and plastic pollution, and Christmas is one of them. But what we learn will reach far beyond the big day. What Christmas offers us is a moment to look at how we might find pleasure in a zero-emissions world.In the book There Is No Planet B, Mike Berners-Lee remarks that what we need to do is ldquoget better at enjoying things that donrsquot require much energy. Examples include walks, books, most types of party, most forms of socialising, local holidays and any hobby that doesnrsquot rely on fossil fuel.Sounds like a recipe for a merry eco ChristmasItrsquos beginning to look a lot like nut roastTofu on every table ... or is it  Letrsquos face it, Christmas is a feast day. Itrsquos all about the food, about getting your loved ones round the table and eating more than you normally do. Food is an emotional thing and for many a roast bird resonates festive feeling. If Christmas is anything like last year,we in the UK will consume around  million turkeys.So, do we have to, in the interests of the planet, go cold turkey and ditch the festive favourite  Perhaps not, though it would go some way towards helping cut your emissions for the day. One study, carried out by the University of Manchester, found that a UK Christmas dinner for six produces the equivalent of kg of carbon dioxide emissions, and that % of these are related to the le cycle of the turkey. By contrast, a vegan nut roast plus roast potatoes cooked in vegetable oil, vegan pigs in blankets, sage and onion stuffing, and vegetable gravy to feed six emits only .kg of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.But, at the same time, there are many good things about a traditional Christmas dinner. The vegetables are usually seasonal, of the sort that can be grown locally. A roast turkey is also not nearly as bad as a regular Sunday roast of beef. As Mike Berners-Lee has put it: ldquoChickens and turkeys are very much at the efficient end of the meat spectrum. Red meats are a quite a lot less efficient. The carbon footprint of beef would be about  kilos of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilo of beef, whereas for turkey, it would be nearer three.In fact, you might want to be more wary about the sustainability of the party bites and the fancy starters than the turkey dinner. Have the scallops come from a seabed damaged by dredging  Is the smoked salmon from a farm plagued with parasitic sea lice, or that pollutes the sea  Has the farming of those giant tiger prawns resulted in the chopping down of a mangrove forest, a vital carbon sink  Have your avocados resulted in a drought in another part of the world Buying local and keeping the transport emissions as low as possible is another way of whittling away at your feasting footprint. Also, remember itrsquos okay to have a feast, or a moment of indulgenceit is, as tradition dictates, the big blow-out before a winter of scarcity. If yoursquore just about to embark on Veganuary and you love nothing more than a Christmas turkey ndash have it. Itrsquos not what you eat on one day that matters. Itrsquos what you eat every day.Flying home for Christmas One of the problems with Christmas is that so much of it is about the love miles. A study into ldquoThe Carbon Cost of Christmas found that the average UK resident will travel around  miles to visit family and friends at Christmas. How they do that will have a big impact on their emissions.Last year, when the Energy Saving Trust looked into the travel emissions impact of Christmas, it took a round trip from London to Edinburgh as an example.By plane the journey resulted in emissions of kg, by train kg and by petrol car kg . To put this Christmas carbon footprint in perspective, for the emissions tag of that London-to-Edinburgh trip you could sit down to a slap-up meal of nine-and-a-half turkeys all to yourself.But love miles, and associated love emissions, are the hardest thing to talk about around Christmas. After all, gathering together is what, for many of us, it is all about ndash and we now live in a world where relationships are stretched sometimes between continents. For many of us, though, there are ways of cutting down the emissions. Taking the train, not plane, for instance, is one. Sharing a car journey with others is another.On the first day of leftovers, my true love made for me hellipA spiced turkey naan and a nut roast falafel wrap. Or one of the other wonderful recipes that can make Christmas leftovers such a treat. According to Zero Waste Scotland, ldquo, tonnes of food and drink is thrown away from Scottish homes in December alone. Avoiding just % of that waste would save nearly , tonnes of carbon ndash the equivalent of taking , cars off the road in the UK for a year.There are, of course, several other ways of reducing waste. Cooking only what you need, paying attention to portion size, and not getting sucked in by a particularly attractive BOGOF are part of the formula ndash as well as picking every last shard off that turkey carcass and making the feast last.Simply having a wrapping-free Christmas timeThat moment when the floor is covered in torn wrapping paper is no longer a feelgood one. You can cram it into that bin liner as fast as you like, but the truth is that a lot of wrapping paper, particularly the fancy stuff with the glitter on, or foil or plastic incorporated, isnrsquot recyclable. Scots, a new guide by Zero Waste Scotland claims, are expected to use upwards of , miles of wrapping paper this Christmas. ldquoIf we were to cut that down by just a quarter we could save around , tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from being released into the atmosphere. Thatrsquos the same as , flights from Edinburgh to New York.Many novel solutions have been proposed this year, some of which have been published in an online guide to a sustainable Christmas by Zero Waste Scotland. One, popular in many eco guides this year, has been wrapping presents in scarfs, which are then reused. Better still, we could learn a lot from our elders. The careful removal of wrapping paper, to be folded and put away for next year, is something that used to be a common practice. Also, our lives are littered in paper, whether newspapers or childrenrsquos artwork, which could be creatively repurposed.Have yourself a plastic-free Christmas crackerCrackers have also come in for a lot of stick this year. All that paper and cardboard waste, not to mention the useless little plastic whistles and magnying glasses which get chucked the moment that the table is cleared. But there are solutions. John Lewis is selling plastic-free crackers, with gts made from metal, glass and paper. Although, isnrsquot that just more pointless waste  Better, surely, to stick to, or even make, the kind of cracker that only delivers a party hat and a joke All I want for Christmas is youWe donrsquot have to give up gt-giving all together, just get more thoughtful about it. The climate emergency invites us to break a few taboos and establish new norms ndash for instance, to blatantly regt, or to give items that are second-hand. Last year, a friend passed on to me some pristine stocking-fillers that her kids had received the previous year but never used. I shamelessly stuffed them into my own kidsrsquo stockings.If you want to be really ethical, of course, you can gt charity donations. But the problem with that is that it doesnrsquot quite satisfy that desire many of us have to treat our loved ones. Low-emission ways of doing that include creating your own personal gt card, offering time or some other experience-related treat ndash a series of babysitting sessions, or to fix a bike, or cook a special meal. Again check out the Zero Waste Scotland guide.Last Christmas I bought a new jumper. The very next day I gave it awayThis year, to save us all from tears, you might want to consider rewearing last yearrsquos jumper or party frock, and keeping it going for another few seasons. Remember, % of human carbon emissions come from the fashion industry, and those nice fleecy Christmas tops leach microplastics into the environment. That said, the plus side of a nice fluffy Christmas jumper is that it might lead you to turn the thermostat down a click and cut a few emissions that way.Rockinrsquo around the live Christmas treeThe debate has raged for years between whether itrsquos better to get an articial tree or a real one.

Underwhelming. I was shouting at the TV, said Kelly of the ITV head to head between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. She is not alone in wonderingthe debates have become too much of a bad thing.After the same ITV debate hosted by Julie Etchingham, criticism on social media ranged from ldquoworse than useless: soundbite answers, no scrutiny, clapping partisans in the audience, to ldquoan hourrsquos worth of repetitive sound bites and evasive answers with little content. Last weekrsquos STV Leaders Debate was similarly heckled. ldquoWhat a rabble, said one viewer. ldquoThe same old it wisnae us it was them garbage. Masterchef is definitely a better choice.In this election, viewers have been offered two head to head leaders debates a Question Time leaders special a seven-way clash of leading party figures a climate emergency event at which no-shows Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage were replaced by ice sculptures and an STV debate for Scottish party leaders. On Monday there is a Question Time special for young voters, and on Tuesday, BBC Scotland just makes it under the wire ahead of polling day on December  with its leaders debate.Perhaps the dearth of debates for so long accounts for the current torrent. Debates had been a mainstay on American television since , and were part of the TV landscape in Germany, Australia and where. But Britain had to wait till  for its first clash, between David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Gordon Brown. What took us so long  Debates were thought to be ldquotoo trivial, too American, summed up Ric Bailey in a report for the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. But that was only part of it.ldquoDebates did not happen before  for a very clear reason... Opposing Westminster political parties would not agree to TV election debates until they were sure there was something in it, electorally, for them.One early fan of the  debates was Andy Murray, who told the Independent on Sunday he was ldquohooked on them. The tennis player was  at the time. One of the benefits of the debates, it would be later argued, was that they increased interest and engagement among young voters.Not everyone was convinced. Critics accused the debates of putting show before substance and taking away from the dissection and discussion of policies. The historian Andrew Roberts said: ldquoTo watch Gordon Brown, who was, after all, the statesman who kept us out of the euro, having to tell clunkingly bad gags about how Cameron and Clegg lsquoremind me of my boys at bathtime, squabbling in the bathrsquo, was to recognize how television inevitably infantilises and cheapens our democracy.Dr Andy Dougan, lecturer in film and television studies at The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is not a fan of the debates as currently constituted. He prefers the American and Canadian system where independent commissions are in charge of the rules. In the US, debates have several moderators, distinct subjects, for example, foreign policy, and strict rules on timing. It is not mandatory to participate, but the debates have become such an accepted part of electoral le it would be very odd for anyone to stay away.ldquo[The politicians] can perform, they can pull rabbits out of hats as much as they want but there has to be a degree of control to the scrutiny they are put under, says Dougan. ldquoThatrsquos probably the best way of getting information to the electorate.Other suggested reforms include switching off mics so other speakers cannot interrupt when someone is giving an answer making the debates longer and have participants seated across from each other at a deskand asking the audience to stay quiet, as happened in . In this campaign, parties and viewers have complained about audiences cheering, laughing and jeering.Without rules, says Dougan, debates become bun fights. ldquoEverything degenerates into soundbites, who can be snappy, who can come up with the best one liner.

The breakfast television host is marking her th birthday year by letting rip on all manner of topics, from the candour of Boris Johnsonrsquos former tech tutor Jenner Arcurito televised election debates.ldquoTerrible. Underwhelming. I was shouting at the TV, said Kelly of the ITV head to head between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. She is not alone in wonderingthe debates have become too much of a bad thing.After the same ITV debate hosted by Julie Etchingham, criticism on social media ranged from ldquoworse than useless: soundbite answers, no scrutiny, clapping partisans in the audience, to ldquoan hourrsquos worth of repetitive sound bites and evasive answers with little content. Last weekrsquos STV Leaders Debate was similarly heckled. ldquoWhat a rabble, said one viewer. ldquoThe same old it wisnae us it was them garbage. Masterchef is definitely a better choice.In this election, viewers have been offered two head to head leaders debates a Question Time leaders special a seven-way clash of leading party figures a climate emergency event at which no-shows Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage were replaced by ice sculptures and an STV debate for Scottish party leaders. On Monday there is a Question Time special for young voters, and on Tuesday, BBC Scotland just makes it under the wire ahead of polling day on December  with its leaders debate.Perhaps the dearth of debates for so long accounts for the current torrent. Debates had been a mainstay on American television since , and were part of the TV landscape in Germany, Australia and where. But Britain had to wait till  for its first clash, between David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Gordon Brown. What took us so long  Debates were thought to be ldquotoo trivial, too American, summed up Ric Bailey in a report for the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. But that was only part of it.ldquoDebates did not happen before  for a very clear reason... Opposing Westminster political parties would not agree to TV election debates until they were sure there was something in it, electorally, for them.One early fan of the  debates was Andy Murray, who told the Independent on Sunday he was ldquohooked on them. The tennis player was  at the time. One of the benefits of the debates, it would be later argued, was that they increased interest and engagement among young voters.Not everyone was convinced. Critics accused the debates of putting show before substance and taking away from the dissection and discussion of policies. The historian Andrew Roberts said: ldquoTo watch Gordon Brown, who was, after all, the statesman who kept us out of the euro, having to tell clunkingly bad gags about how Cameron and Clegg lsquoremind me of my boys at bathtime, squabbling in the bathrsquo, was to recognize how television inevitably infantilises and cheapens our democracy.Dr Andy Dougan, lecturer in film and television studies at The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is not a fan of the debates as currently constituted. He prefers the American and Canadian system where independent commissions are in charge of the rules. In the US, debates have several moderators, distinct subjects, for example, foreign policy, and strict rules on timing. It is not mandatory to participate, but the debates have become such an accepted part of electoral le it would be very odd for anyone to stay away.ldquo[The politicians] can perform, they can pull rabbits out of hats as much as they want but there has to be a degree of control to the scrutiny they are put under, says Dougan. ldquoThatrsquos probably the best way of getting information to the electorate.Other suggested reforms include switching off mics so other speakers cannot interrupt when someone is giving an answer making the debates longer and have participants seated across from each other at a deskand asking the audience to stay quiet, as happened in . In this campaign, parties and viewers have complained about audiences cheering, laughing and jeering.Without rules, says Dougan, debates become bun fights. ldquoEverything degenerates into soundbites, who can be snappy, who can come up with the best one liner. There is no substance to them.He prefers the Andrew Neil one-to-one, forensic approach to debates. But what of the argument that debates are a good test of mettle, a way of finding outa candidate has the right stuff to lead the country ldquoWe are looking for a Prime Minister, not a presenter of The Price is Right.

Die Harddoesnrsquot conform to the Nativity template ndash yet theres still lots of family, redemption, and villains, so the echoes are there nonetheless. But those secret ingredients, that Nativity recipe, is deeply embedded in all the Christmas biggies: Itrsquos A Wonderful Le, A Christmas Carol, Miracle on th Street, Scrooged. Yoursquoll find traces in all other Christmas movies ndash even the likes of Home Alone and Gremlins.CHILDRENApart from the Santa-exploitation genre ndash yes, such films exist, just check out blood-soaked slasher flicks like Black Christmas, or Norwayrsquos Rare Exports ndash children are at the heart of Christmas movies. You canrsquot have a good Christmas movie without kids.Even films that seem thoroughly unChristmasy ndash that mock Christmas ndash like Bad Santa are driven by children. In Bad Santa, Billy Bob Thornton plays the most despicable department store Father Christmas whorsquos ever lived. Hersquos a robber, a sleaze-bag, a filthy, shameless drunk. But hersquos redeemed by the kindnessof one little boy ndash the tubby, half-witted dupe Thurman Merman.Bad Santa has a long line of predecessors. Look no further than the Grinch ndash a green, hairy fiend so awful that in the  cartoon How the Grinch Stole Christmas hersquos even voiced by Boris Karloff, the man who gave us the original Frankenstein. Who saves the Grinch  Who makes his lsquoheart grow two sizesrsquo  Little Cindy Lou Who who was no more than two ndash thatrsquos who. A child saves a monster. Itrsquos an eternal Christmas theme.Christmas films which we think are about adults are often actually about children. For me, the big three Christmas movies are Itrsquos A Wonderful Le, any version of A Christmas Caroland Scrooged. They all share the same cinematic DNA. Seemingly, they all tell the story of a man whorsquos given a second chance at le thanks to the intervention of spirits on Christmas Eve. But actually, each of those films is about a man whorsquos saved by rediscovering the truths and values of his own childhood. Theyrsquore all about innocence regained in the face of a cruel world.FAMILYIn most Christmas movies, family is valued above all  ndash which is kind of ironic given a lot of us would gladly kill at least one relative over the holidays. But maybe thatrsquos the point ndash these films remind us to be good to those we love at this time of year even though they may drive us mad, because, really, theyrsquore all wersquove got in this world.Itrsquos the loss of family or absence of family which adds poignancy to the lives of the main characters. Think of Frank Cross, played by Bill Murray in Scrooged, or Ebenezer Scrooge himself. The paths they took led to a le without love ndash no partner, no children, relatives pushed away. Without family, their lives are meaningless so they fill up on greed and ambition. Theyrsquore so self-starved of love that theyrsquore almost inhuman.When Frank and Ebenezer are redeemed, the redemption comes with the gt of family ndash for Frank, his old love s to him, and his bond with his brother is rebuilt Ebenezer gets Christmas Day with his estranged nephew and the discovery of a surrogate family thanks to Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim.In Miracle on th Street, the film ends with little Susan, the girl who couldnrsquot believe in Santa, finding that Father Christmas has granted her wishes and given her a home and a family as a present. If you donrsquot cry at that, then therersquos something wrong with you.Love Actually is one giant portmanteau movie with a single message ndash people need people. Love is all around, remember. It doesnrsquot matteryoursquore the Prime Minister, a scorned we, a Portuguese cleaner, or an infatuated pre-teen, Christmas canrsquot exist unless we all have someone to love.Plenty of Christmas movies turn the idea of the healing power of family upside down, though. Letrsquos be honest, we need a little cynicism to cut through the schmaltz at this time of year.The Family Stone is a good example ndash itrsquos not so cynical that itrsquoll kill your Christmas, but itrsquos honest about the Christmases we all have as families forced to come together and spend time with in-laws like the awful Meredith, played by Sarah Jessica Parker. Much more subversively anti-Christmas is the delightfully idiotic National Lampoonrsquos Christmas Vacation. Itrsquos a story of a family of profoundly stupid people, led by Chevy Chase, making each other miserable over Christmas.The French Christmas movie Un Conte de Noel , stars Catherine Deneuve as a matriarch forcibly holding her family together. The film takes cynicism towards the idea of the happy family into a much darker and more adult place. This is Christmas with domestic violence, heavy drinking, adultery and cancer. Yet still the message is that without unconditional love, wersquove really got nothing.THE SUPERNATURALThe best Christmas films are otherworldly. Christmas is meant to be magical ndash the Nativity story itself is full of magic and wonder.Itrsquos A Wonderful Le is now as much a part of Christmas as turkey and presents. Many families watch it religiously every Christmas Eve. Without the element of the supernatural, this film would be too dark too bear. It would be a tale of a decent man ruined by the world who then takes his own le on Christmas Eve leaving his loving we and children behind.But Clarence, the eccentric angel working to get his wings, takes the terrible destruction of Jimmy Stewartrsquos character George Bailey and turns it into a comic chaotic tale of salvation ndash albeit one in which itrsquos still impossible not to shudder at the darkness the film explores.Charles Dickens laid down the template for the supernatural at Christmas with A Christmas Carol. He is, after all, commemorated in another festive film as The Man Who Invented Christmas. What would A Christmas Carol be without its ghosts  Without Jacob Marley, and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come, it would simply be the story of a cruel and lonely old man looking back on his wasted le. But the ghosts terrorise Scrooge, they force him to change into a better person. Scrooge has to see his own death and the death of others to realise that his greed and ambition were all for nothing.In Christmas movies, the supernatural is the catalyst for change. Without the intervention of Cary Grantrsquos angel Dudley in The Bishoprsquos We , a troubled couple might have lost their marriage and forgotten the love they had for each other. Humans are stupid, you see, in Christmas movies ndash we need a little push from powers greater than ourselves to make sure we become the people we ought to be.VILLAINSVillains in Christmas movies are nearly always rich, theyrsquore often businessmen or political figures. Think of the utterly evil Mr Potter in Itrsquos A Wonderful Le. Think of Buddyrsquos dad, played by James Caan, in Elf ndash a villain redeemed. Therersquos Scrooge himself. Therersquos the rival department store owner in Miracle on th Street. In Santa Claus the Movie, starring Dudley Moore as the elf Patch, John Lithgow plays BZ, a thoroughly despicable executive who wants to hijack Christmas.If you think of the original Christmas story, the heroes shymdash Jesus, Mary and Joseph ndash are dirt poor. Christ is born in a stable. Theyrsquore hunted by King Herod. Christianity is about loving the poor, and rich men never getting into the kingdom of heaven.If you watch Itrsquos A Wonderful Le carefully it sometimes comes across as a socialist tract. Capitalism is monstrous in the film ndash money destroys everything ndash and only sharing resources and loving one another can provide a route to happiness. Trading Places is similar ndash the modern take on The Prince and the Pauper set at Christmas makes a homeless hustler a hero and a Wall Street giant a mean-spirited nothing.Whatrsquos fascinating about the role of the villain in Christmas films is that the hero is often the villain as well. No other genre plays this game so well. Frank Cross in Scrooged and Ebenezer himself turn from rich, selfish, cruel misanthropes to men who literally give everything away ndash because at the end, once Christmas has changed them, they realise money means nothing compared to love.BELIEFYoursquove got to believe at Christmas time. Donrsquot we all suspend our disbelief a little on Christmas Eve and remember what it was like to be a child in bed dreaming of Santa on his way  In Joyeux Noel, which tells the story of the  Christmas truce in the trenches, Christmas itself restores belief in peace and humanity. Of course, when Christmas ends, belief fades and war s.In the film Nativity! Martin Freeman has to believe that he can put on the school Christmas play. In Jingle All the Way, Arnold Schwarzenegger has to believe he can find that action toy. In Planes, Trains and AutomobilesJohn Candy and Steve Martin have to believe that they can get home.In a Christmas film, belief means sacricing something to help others ndash because Christmas is about giving. Without sacrice, belief is meaningless. Therersquos those echoes of the nativity story again.In Nativity! Freemanrsquos character hates Christmas but has to put on the school play ndash his reward is success, love, and a newly found fondness for Christmas. Arnie nearly kills himself trying to get his son a present ndash but the suffering makes him a better dad and a better person. John Candy and Steve Martin have to suffer each other to discover that theyrsquore friends after all.The central theme of The Polar Express is simple belief ndash the magic of a childrsquos faith in Christmas, and the saving power of belief in something good, something greater than yourself, in this case Christmas.CHAOSIn The Nightmare Before Christmas, Tim Burtonrsquos deliciously dark Christmas cartoon, Santa is kidnapped by Halloweenrsquos Pumpkin King, Jack Skellington, and all hell breaks loose. Order is only restored when Santa is freed and able to brings gts to all.Christmas is a time when the forces of chaos and darkness are beaten by the simplest of things ndash love and kindness. Thatrsquos the revolutionary message of Christmas and the movies which celebrate Christmas.Gremlins is a study in chaos. Home Alone is one long chaotic slap-stick routine. As with The Nightmare Before Christmas, the forces of chaos come in from outside ndash this time the two hapless robbers played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern ndash threaten Christmas itself and are finally defeated, so that we can allto eggnog and loving each other. In The Santa Clause, Father Christmas dies, and chaos erupts until Tim Allen truly becomes the new Santa.Die Hard is basically a fairytale ndash the handsome prince has to save the damsel in the tower ndash and fairytales are driven by chaos. Hans Gruber, played by Alan Rickman with scenery-chewing brilliance, is the force of chaos come to destroy Christmas. Once Gruber is defeated, the lovers are reunited and up comes the title music, Let It Snow.MUSICSpeaking of music, Christmas films know that their principal purpose is to play with our emotions. If they donrsquot make us cry, they have to make us smile. Andyou want to manipulate emotions then call in the string section.When Judy Garland sings Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas in Meet Me in St Louis, itrsquos so heart-breaking even a stone would cry. When Bing Crosby sings White Christmas amid the ruins of World War Two in the film White Christmas, itrsquos impossible not to choke up a little thinking of all the men whorsquod never come home again to see their loved ones at Christmas time.Songs bring out the beauty and silliness of Christmas like Will Ferrellrsquos Buddy the Elf singing Itrsquos Cold Outside to Zooey Deschanel, or Bill Nighyrsquos over the hill rocker reprising Love Is All Around.The best song ever in a Christmas movie  The end scene of Scroogedwhere Bill Murrayrsquos Frank Cross leads the audience in a rendition of Put A Little Love in Your Heart. It makes you smile, and it makes you cry at the same time ndash at leastyoursquore me.Isnrsquot that what Christmas is about  Wersquove all had a tough year. Wersquove cried at times. Wersquove failed at things. Wersquove had regrets. But at heart, wersquore essentially good. We just need reminded of our goodness sometimes ndash and when we remember that, at the end of the year, we can all smile, at least for one day.As Frank Cross says: ldquoFor a couple of hours out of a whole year, wersquore the people we always hoped we would be.Wersquore redeemed.NEXT WEEK: THE BEST CHRISTMAS STORIES"},{"url":null,"title":"election-youthquake-dismiss-voice-young-people-peril","story":"Donrsquot underestimate the youth vote this election.

Growing poverty, the commercialisation of higher education, and tackling the climate crisis with the seriousness it demands all motivate young people, but the top driver is the burning desire to stop what we see as the impending Brexit disaster. Because we are convinced Brexit will exacerbate every other problem and remove our rights for no gain.In the youthrsquos quest itrsquos a matter of ldquoso far, so good ndash wersquore still in the EU, are we not  And yet Brexit limps on. On Thursday young people have one central mission: finish what we failed to do last time. Knock Brexit dead.Whereas older voters have had decades to build loyalty to one party, young people are much more fickle. It isnrsquot just in voting. In the past you had to buy a whole music album and be loyal to an artist. Now young people stream music and listen to the inidual songs they like and ignore the rest. This floating habit will manest itself in an unprecedented willingness to vote tactically to defeat the Tories on a seat-by-seat basis, whichever party that means opting for.Yesterday young black and minority ethnicpeople from Boris Johnsonrsquos outer-London constituency held FCK BORIS LIVE, a rave in support of ousting the Prime Minister from his own seat.

For this election it was more than three million. About a third of these voters were already registered, because our system doesnrsquot enable you to check. Some commentators have taken this as reason to downplay the size of the next ldquoyouthquake, but I view it dferently. Young people are determined to make sure they are registered, and this shows they will then follow through and vote on the day.In this age of social media, young people are taking their passion to everyone theyrsquove ever known, through Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. Special photo filters and icons on Thursday will make voting look like ldquothe thing to do. Facebook also made it easy for Britons to share that they were registered to vote, with a link to the online form ahead of last monthrsquos deadline. More than , people shared it. But many didnrsquot wait for Facebookrsquos prompting, having started sending out the link before the election was called.Cold conditions and early nightfall donrsquot stop young people having numerous pre-Christmas nights out, so, as bleak as it gets, the fact the election is in December wonrsquot keep them from having their say on who governs Britain.Young people canrsquot decide the outcome alone, but we will be out in force, set on snatching a majority out from under the Tories yet again."},{"url":null,"title":"interview-professor-mike-dixon-maggies-centres-memories-harry-secombe","story":"Interview: Professor Mike Dixon on Maggie#s Centres, memories and Harry SecombeProf Mike Dixon at Edinburgh#s Maggie#s Centre. The senior breast cancerltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt surgeon is reducingltspan classtruncate-full-screengt his hours after  years treating thousands of women. STYPic Gordon Terris The HeraldOf all the things for one of Scotlandrsquos leading breast cancer experts to recall from a career spanning four decades and tens of thousands of patients, a p Harry Secombe record may seem the strangest.Not that consultant breast surgeon Professor Mike Dixon does not recall with crystal clarity the faces, names and medical details of an astonishing number of women treated at his Edinburgh clinics.Totting them up is harder:There are women who dragged themselves through the doors of the UKrsquos busiest breast unit fearing a death sentence.Ones who dreaded breast removal ndash and in the early days when battling cancer could be a brutal affair, they may have been right to.The stoic families who threw a consoling arm around him at deeply moving funerals.Dying young mums with tiny children in tow, the bright-eyed teenagers, worried grandmothers, frightened sisters and the many, with worrisome but benign lumps and bumps that turned out to be easier to fix than they feared.ldquoWe see , patients in our clinics every year ndash around  a week, he says, trying to figure out just how many lives he has touched since arriving in Edinburgh in the early s to his recent plans for retirement and dramatic reduction in his hours at the Western General Hospitalrsquos breast care clinic.He eventually plumps for a figure of somewhere between , and , breast care patients.At least , he guesses, would be in the grip of breast cancer.Of them, there have been many who, having poured out their fears, thanked him for being the only doctor who actually listened.That they landed on the books of a surgeon and consultant with a reputation for a mellow bedside manner appears to be at least partly down to that p Harry Secombe record.The son of a Sheffield steelworker and shopkeeper, Dixon grew up in one of the steel townrsquos poorer areas, walking out of school at  with four A levels and an interest in medicine.But rather than plunge into university, he opted to learn the very basics of patient care, first as a porter in the physiotherapy department at Sheffield Northern General and then as an auxiliary nurse in an old peoplersquos home.To break the monotony of the hospital waiting room, hersquod bring the portable record player he used for his other job as a DJ, and entertained the patients.ldquoIt was the most valuable time for me, says Dixon, a natural born communicator. ldquoThere was an old guy I used to see, he was always grumpy as a lot of old people can be.ldquoOne day I made him tea in a huge mug and spoke to him about music. I asked what he liked, and he said lsquoHarry Secombersquo.Within days Dixon found a Harry Secombe record in a box on the pavement outside a record shop.He paid p for it and then played it while grateful tears rolled down the elderly manrsquos cheeks.ldquoI realised itrsquos the little things you do with patients, the time you spend talking to them, getting to know what will make a dference for them, that matters, Dixon says.ldquoYou also discover that a good health system is built from the bottom up, not the top down, and that the most important thing you can do, is listen to people.He planned to become a pathologist until a meeting with an ebullient American with a passion for breast disease swept him in a wave of enthusiasm and convinced the Edinburgh University graduate to sht focus.It set in motion a chain of events that would not only touch the lives of his patients, but others up and down the country.Maggie Keswick Jencks was a charismatic writer, artist and garden designer whose breast cancer had metastasized to her liver and lymph nodes.By the time she reached the Western Generalrsquos care, her condition was dire.ldquoShe said when she was diagnosed, the doctor told her that he had more patients to see, and could she leave the room, he says.ldquoShe was told to make the most of the two or three months she had left.ldquoShe was harshly treated, he adds. ldquoWe gave her chemotherapy and stem cell rescue and repopulated her bone marrow from her own blood.ldquoFor three and a half years she was fantastic, no breast cancer, we got rid of it from her liver, she did great.She told Dixon and her care team of her hope that all breast cancer patients could have the support to help them through. The blueprint they drafted drew on her feelings of vulnerability and fear, her theory that beautul design and art could comfort and raise spirits and explored therapies and care that could ease women through the dficulties of their diagnosis.The first Maggiersquos Centre opened a stonersquos throw from Dixonrsquos clinic in Western General Hospital grounds in , a few months after her death. Today there are  Maggiersquos Centres with more planned for the future.Between the innovative force of Maggiersquos and the expertise of the Western General breast unit ndash the UKrsquos busiest of its kind ndash Edinburgh has grown as a focal point for pioneering breast care.As well as leading the way in the introduction of specialist breast care nurses, it is a centre for research. Dixon is clinical lead of Breast Cancer Now Edinburgh Research Team, which is currently focusing on why some patients fail to respond to certain commonly used cancer treatments.Clinical trials are on the horizon, Dixon, however, has other plans.Full retirement is coming, and he is now extrapolating himself, working reduced hours which, nevertheless, saw the -year-old surgeon rattle through six operations one day last week.Within  months he plans to be permanently at his new home in Sussex where hersquos just \"Mike with the two dogs\" and not Professor Dixon, the breast cancer surgeon and consultant.Hersquoll spend precious time with his we, Pam, who throughout his career has shared him with thousands of women, accepting the intrusions their care could make on family le.For those early patients Dixon was the champion helping in their fight for le. Now, however, survival rates have improved dramatically, there are better reconstruction outcomes and less invasive treatment for conditions such as abscesses. Once gouged out in theatre and left to heal for weeks, Dixonrsquos innovative work means they are treated using just a thin needle.ldquoWhen I started, everyone who had breast cancer had to have their breast removed, he reflects. ldquoThe aim was to get the cancer out, it didnrsquot matter what it looked like.ldquoWe now do a lumpectomy and they donrsquot have to be mutilated.ldquoBreast cancer is no longer a disease that women need to fear most who get breast cancer will not die of it.But sometimes things do not go well. The women who didnrsquot make it keep him awake at night, and he holds their memory close.One, he remembers, gave him a pair of quirky Lion King socks as a thank you for her care. In his despair at her loss, he wore them until they were threadbare.And then there are the funerals of women he cared for and, pained by their loss, how he found their loved ones offering him their sympathies.ldquoDo I remember all my successes  No I donrsquot, he says quietly. ldquoI remember the people who didnt make it, or who had complications.ldquoIt has to be like that. The reality is you have to be good every day, and yoursquore only good by not thinking you know everything.ldquoYou have to fear complications so much that you want to escape the risk of ever having that horrible feeling.ldquoAnd yoursquoll do everything you can to get it right."},{"url":null,"title":"general-election-2019-incoherent-campaign-harming-snp-helping-tories-says-senior-snp-member","story":"Brexit has also been cited as a reason for the fall in support by a top academic, who suggested some voters may see the chaos over leaving the EU as an indication of how dficult breaking away from the union could be.The SNP, which still has a high popularity rating among voters, is predicted to win the majority of Scottish seats in Thursdays General Election, but one senior party source said their strategy \"has probably meant the Tories are going to do better than we hoped\".A YouGov poll of  Scots published yesterday showed that support for leaving the union was  per cent ndash  percentage point lower than that achieved during the  referendum.The previous poll by the same firm in September showed % of respondents said they would vote in favour of independence while % would vote against.A senior SNP source told The Herald on Sunday the lack of dynamism in the partys campaign messaging may have cost them support for leaving the union.He said: \"I think the campaign hasnrsquot quite understood what the central message is ndash Stop Brexit in some places, Peoplersquos Vote in others, Stop Boris, and then Indyref in others.\"I think the lack of a coherent message, and the leadership being too risk-averse, has probably meant the Tories are going to do better than we hoped.\"Nicola Sturgeon has not addressed the poll results directly but yesterday joined Westminster candidate Fergus Mutch in Aberdeen where she urged voters to unite around the SNP to stop Boris Johnson re-entering Number , and to prevent Brexit.One academic said the SNP had \"no choice\" but to campaign for a second referendum, and the decline in support was likely to be the \"Brexit effect\" rather than a drop in popularity for the SNP itself.Rob Johns, professor of politics at the University of Essex, said: \"The SNP dont have that much choice on what they focus on. They have an enthusiastic base, part of which is much more enthusiastic than they perceive the leadership to be.\"If the leadership downplayed independence they would have a lot of people asking them What the hell  effectively.\"The SNP tends to do best when voters think there isnt going to be a majority, so they think that a lot of SNP MPs could really make a dference for Scotland. Realistically when you look at what voters believe this election is going to be, most of them think it will be a majority Tory Government which will do what it wants.\"As a result of that perception, the SNP doesnt really have that angle to go at, so it kind of had to campaign for independence.\"As to what effect its had, firstly it is only one poll. Secondly this is the biggest switch weve seen for ages, but its not a huge switch in absolute terms ndash it shows how kind of engrained these things are. It is not assupport has collapsed.\"Its hard for us to say what has caused it but my best guess is that its less about the way the SNP has campaigned and more about the Brexit effect highlighting the dficulties that independence could bring.\"Its hard to say there would be any sort of smooth transition to independence.\"It doesnt mean that people dont want independence, but it has amplied the reasons why people might be wary of voting for it now.\"Johns added that since devolution, domestic issues which are the responsibility of the Scottish Government are still brought up by opposition parties during general elections as a way of \"having a go\" at the SNPs record.He said: \"Post-devolution, during general elections it is noticeable when they are not talking about independence. The opposition wants to talk about other issues like health and education, but strictly speaking that isnt up for grabs in this election.\"Its a way of having a go at the SNP.\"The SNP doesnt want to feel vulnerable on their domestic record, it doesnt really want to talk so much about domestic performance.\"Annie Wells, the Conservative MSP, yesterday criticised the Nationalists on their performance in devolved issues including health and education, while Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader also hit out at health inequalities under the SNP.Wells said: \"People are sick of referendums, whether itrsquos independence or Brexit.ldquoBoth these need to be put to bed so Scotland can move on, and the Scottish Conservatives seem to be the only ones wanting to do that.ldquoPeople are clearly getting sick of Nicola Sturgeonrsquos endless lecturing on the break-up of the UK. This poll comes at the end of a week where the SNPrsquos domestic record has been brutally exposed.ldquoVoters are increasingly seeing that a decade of independence distraction has heavily compromised health, education and other matters the SNP is responsible for.Yesterday Scottish Labour launched a plan to tackle \"deepening health inequalities\" across the country, with Leonard saying people were growing tired of \"constitutional bickering\"He said: \"It is clear that the people of Scotland are weary of constitutional bickering and are looking actively for a programme that will tackle the blight of child poverty, end food bank Britain and give working people a say in the running of the economy.ldquoThat is what Labour is proposing in this election. Labour provide a radical alternative to the status quo and will bring about real change for Scotland and Britain.ldquo Labour will provide poundbn in additional investment for Scotland over two terms, eclipsing the SNPrsquos case for the construction of a separate Scottish state, and place the people of Scotland in the driving seat of the economy.\"Scottish Liberal Democrats leader Willie Rennie, meanwhile, said the decline in the support for independence was partly down to Brexit fatigue.He said: \"Support for independence is down for a multitude of reasons including the realisation that independence would be just like Brexit.\"People are exhausted with all the constitutional chaos of Brexit and independence we have endured for years and want to focus on matters that improve peoplersquos lives like mental health, childcare and the climate.\"People certainly donrsquot want another isive independence referendum within months as the SNP want. Thatrsquos why ever more people are backing the Liberal Democrats to stop independence as well as stopping Brexit.An SNP spokeswoman said: \"This crucial election is about locking Boris Johnson out of Downing Street, escaping Brexit and securing Scotlands right to choose.\"All other recent polls have shown that the issue is a virtual dead heat and that support for independence is rising, including a rise in support for having an independence referendum.\"A vote for the SNP is a vote to put Scotlands future in Scotlands hands ndash not Boris Johnsons.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10768237.jpg?type=article-full","title":"paw-broon-fair-scunnered-wi-snp---vote-conservative-turn-clock-back-scotlands-halcyon-days","story":"Grinning away in a tartan suit as he hawks theldquoScottish Childrenrsquos Lottery, bamboozling the auld yins into thinking every penny of theirpensiontheyspaffaway on lottery ticketsfeedshungry weans in Saltcoats.That wee saltire on the logo will likelyhoodwink Nicola Sturgeonrsquos battle re-enactment enthusiasts too, but theyrsquore so daft they probably think all the Health Lotteryprofits go to the NHS.And michty me, the chance of winning the Health Lotteryrsquos jackpot is ,,-to-one.

The energy produced is enough to power an estimated , homes, but environmentalists claim biomass energy isn’t as green as it appears.Scotlands biomass sites generate enough energy to power , homes.When people think of clean energy, wind turbines and solar  often come to mind.But biomass power plants – a less well-known method of generating renewable electricity – are booming across the UK and environmental campaigners have raised doubts about their green credentials.The burning of trees or plant matter – known as plant biomass – now accounts for more than a fth of the UK’s renewable energy, second only to wind power.The number of plant biomass power plants in the UK has more than trebled in four years, from  in  to  in .Between them, they now produce enough energy to power around . million homes, analysis by the JPIMedia Data Unit has found.In Scotland, the number has quadrupled from  biomass sites in  to  by . Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmOrkney RFC battled their way to Caledonia Shield success this afternoon, beating Dunfermline -.

It is not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland will be appalled at this latest development.“Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services.

The then minister for transport and the islands stated in June  that we did not have the financial resources to extend the scheme to business-related travel and that remains the case.”The Air Discount Scheme was introduced in  by the former MSP for Shetland, Tavish Scott. At that time, work-related travel was included, recognising, in part, that providing a more level playing field for island businesses was key to sustaining population. In April , the government at the time cut business travel for the scheme, insisting that it broke EU rules.Ministers have since been forced to admit that this was untrue and that the decision had been taken for cost-cutting reasons.Mr McArthur said: “This reply from the cabinet secretary is just the latest in a long line of untruths spun by this SNP government in relation to the Air Discount Scheme. When Tavish Scott first introduced ADS in , it covered all flights taken by islanders to and from the Scottish mainland, with the exception of medical flights. It was designed this way, in part, to help businesses in the Northern Isles contribute to their communities and compete on a more level playing field with mainland firms.“For Mr Matheson to state that business-related travel has never been eligible under the scheme, therefore, is flat out wrong. Just as his predecessors were entirely wrong in claiming the decision by the SNP government to cut business-related travel from the scheme was required under EU state aid rules.“Rather than continue to try re-writing history, Mr Matheson should do the right thing and reverse this cut.”Responding, a Transport Scotland spokesman said: #The Air Discount Scheme directly tackles the issue of high air fares in the Highlands and Islands and underlines our commitment to supporting remote communities. “We are committed to continuing the scheme, which provides a  per cent subsidy for eligible passengers and is the highest possible discount under European regulations. Earlier this year, we widened the eligibility area for the scheme to include the entire Caithness postcode, as well as further parts of Sutherland.“The Air Discount Scheme is designed for use by inidual residents in the eligible areas as a means to facilitate improved social cohesion. It is not for the benefit of public bodies or private companies or to subsidise their travel costs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But to be able to now officially say we have raised over twice the amount we set out to achieve is absolutely amazing. The donations came in thick and fast, and we are so grateful to all of those who contributed in any way. Orkney is a tremendously generous place, and the community has yet again come up trumps!#The rest of the money came in from donations from generous iniduals and businesses across the county, via a the newspaper or through The Orcadian website.“All of the money raised in this campaign will stay in Orkney, and is earmarked for this project, so we will very much look forward to seeing how the CLAN team get on with their plans.“They make such a dference to all of us who have been affected by cancer in any way, by giving advice, a supportive shoulder, support, therapies — even organising a roof over our heads during treatment.“They are truly amazing, and this money will mean that more people can benefit from the fantastic work they do.”#The monies raised, by the people of Orkney and further afield, through The Orcadian’s ‘OutreachCLAN’ appeal, will enable us to reach out to more people across the county who are affected by their own or someone ’s cancer diagnosis, and for that we are truly grateful.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not surprisingly, the prospect of this was enough to put some people off from coming forward in the first place.“Rape Crisis Orkney and others have rightly been highlighting the need to find ways of allowing examinations to take place. To their credit, successive Justice Ministers have responded positively since I first raised concerns with them over two years ago.#Since then, a lot of work has been carried out by ious organisations and iniduals to finding solutions that work for island communities but respect the need for equal access to services.“I, therefore, welcome the Forensic Medical Services Bill and its commitment to equal access across all health boards, including our islands.  The provision of support from the Taskforce to assist with creating and enhancing facilities to allow this to happen is also reassuring.#While some iniduals may still prefer to access services where, for a iety of reasons, what is key is that this is a matter of choice.“Hopefully, NHS Orkney working with local partners will now be able to build on the progress made to date so that we have a robust and sustainable local self-referral service in line with other parts of the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Bus Pass Elvis Party official #Brexmas card out now! pic nAsCeGhMSmdash factchecked by my catDecember , He said one of his ldquomost popular policies is ldquofree neutering for stray cats and Boris Johnson.Another issue which he says ldquoreally gets him going is the reduction in the number of public lavatories and has pledged to replace the public toilets which are being closed.Other manesto issues include legalising brothels which Mr Bishop argues will make it safer for women, imposing a speed limit on cyclists using footpaths and improving daytime television.Mr Bishop stood in the Nottingham City Council by-election for Clton North under the Bus-Pass Elvis Party.Yorkshire PartyThe Yorkshire Party is fighting for the north which they argue has been failed by major political parties and deserves better.The party, founded in , is led by former primary school teacher Chris Whitwood. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Yorkshire Party candidates standing in the General Election with leader Chris Whitwood at the front--It has  candidates contesting the General Election right across Yorkshire, which is nearly double that of their first general election in .Mr Whitwood said the party is seen as a ldquopositive alternative and attributes its growth to the feeling by the community that it has been neglected by major political parties in Westminster.ldquoItrsquos an acknowledgement that for so many years Westminster has let down the people of Yorkshire and the north of England as a whole, he told the PA news agency.ldquoTherersquos a feeling that Yorkshire does deserve better.Mr Whitwood pointed to the recent floods in the area as an example of how the area has been neglected while the South East is favoured.ldquoTwo years ago the Government was told flood defence spending plans favoured the South East and then when the floods did hit it took days for the prime minister to recognise that it was a national emergency by which time whole towns were under water, people were homeless and someone actually died, he said.The Yorkshire Party leader said transport was another issue for the region and a key part of the partyrsquos manesto.The party also supports the Brexit referendum but will push for a free trade agreement for Britain.Womenrsquos Equality PartyThe Womenrsquos Equality Partywants to move beyond the MeToo movement to tackle the cultures and systems awash with violence and abuse against women.The party, which has five candidates contesting the General Election, praises the MeToo movement for giving a  to women who have been abused, but said it is time to move further.ldquoWe need that movement to go beyond inidual stories and tackle the inidual cultures and systems, leader Mandu Reid told the PA news agency.ldquoYou could look at what wersquore doing as a continuation, as the next wave of the MeToo movement.The partyrsquos five female candidates are all survivors of abuse and violence and are standing in constituencies where the sitting MPs have been accused of violence and harassment. --Womenrsquos Equality Party leader Mandu Reid--Ms Reid said this ldquoguerrilla approach reflects their priority to end male violence against women and girls.Ms Reid said four of the sitting MPs they stood against announced they would not be re-contesting in their constituencies.The party has also offered to stand aside in some constituenciesother parties adopt their key policies.Ms Reid said it has been a ldquobrilliant success with the Liberal Democrats agreeing to adopt the WEPrsquos key policies and in exchange the WEP candidates have stood down in two seats.ldquoIn a guerrilla indirect way we are exerting influence over what the parties are doing, she said.ldquoThis is an opportunity to prioritise ending violence against women which is a crisis in my view.The party has three key manesto policies including amendments to the Recall Act to allow constituencies to remove MPs found guilty of harassment, sustainable funding for refuges and front line services and universal free childcare.The WEP is against Brexit.Animal Welfare PartyThe leader of the Animal Welfare Party is concerned the General Election will be dominated by Brexit and climate change will be pushed to the side.Leader Vanessa Hudson said about the December  vote and Brexit:ldquoSadly I think climate change will come second in peoplersquos list of priorities.The Animal Welfare Party, founded in ,has six candidates across the UK with most standing in London.Ms Hudson said while the party is a dedicated voice for animals, it is also a party for the planet more broadly.ldquoOther parties might say we are a single issue party but wersquore not, others will be focusing on human issues and the human population but therersquos an elephant in the room, she told the PA news agency.ldquoItrsquos not just people, itrsquos animals and the farm animal population. --Animal Welfare Party leader Vanessa Hudson campaigning in Bethnal Green and Bow--To address climate change she said people need to look at the way they are feeding themselves which is why the Animal Welfare Partyrsquos number one manesto policy is to lead the UK to a plant-based food system.Other manesto policies include increasing penalties for animal abuse, ending the badger cull, strengthening the fox hunting ban and ending live exports.On Britain leaving the EU, the group opposes a hard Brexit and supports a second referendum on a final exit deal.Asked how the party is dferent to the Green Party, Ms Hudson said: ldquoWe would say the Green Party have a lot of great issues on animals hellip but for us the reason many of us entered politics, wersquove all come to this as we feel animals needed a dedicated voice, someone who solely focuses on animal issues.Christian Parties AllianceThis General Election the Christian Parties Allianceis focusing on one main seat ndash Walthamstow ndash and disrupting the sitting MPrsquos fight to decriminalise abortion.The Christian Party Alliance has  candidates standing in the election ndash many of which are in London.Party leader Sid Cordle said their campaigning will be focused on the north-east London district of Walthamstow against Labour candidate Stella Creasy.Ms Creasy is a vocal campaigner for abortion rights and supported efforts to bring about a change in the law to see abortion decriminalised in Northern Ireland which the CPA disagrees with.ldquoTo us it is morally totally indefensible, he told the PA news agency.ldquoI felt that for this election we should still stand as many candidates as we can but focus campaigning all in one seat.The party, founded in , has five main policies in their manesto which include protecting unborn children and fighting crime by working with people when they leave prison to reduce re-offending rates.They also support honouring the  Brexit referendum and giving grants to people who get married and for their first child.The Peace PartyThe Peace Party is going into this General Election campaigning that remaining in the EU is vital to maintain peace across Britain.The partyrsquos leader John Morris, who is one of two candidates standing in the December  poll, said the group is in favour of Britain belonging in the EU.ldquoIn the present situation we would go along with the idea of revoking article  and stopping the Brexit process, he told the PA news agency.ldquoThe EU is vital for the maintenance of peace.ldquoMy parents lived through two world wars, I lived through one and my children and grandchildren havenrsquot hellip Thatrsquos a bit of a clue of how important I believe the EU is towards the maintaining of peace.Mr Morris, who is this year contesting Guildford in Surrey, said it is clear what the party, which was founded in , stands for from its name. He said there are two ways to define peace, with his party supporting ldquopositive peace which means society is working in such a way that it supports everyone in ldquoall ways possible.The partyrsquos key manesto policy is conflict resolution which includes campaigning for peaceful conflict resolutions, disband the armed forces, decommissioning all weapons and withdrawing from all current military commitments.Other policies include using the proportional representation election system, legalising the sale, distribution and use of psycho-active substances and repealing legislation that prevents prisoners from voting.copy -.

Mark Twain made it popular in America but mistakenly attributed it to British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Apparently it originally came from an anonymous writer. At least that’s what it said on the internet, so it must be true, right Political spin and misinformation are nothing new, butfeels like the balance has tipped to the point where you genuinely cannot trust the majority of political information you see now on social media or hear on the television or radio – especiallyit comes from any of our main parties.: Nicola Sturgeon believes tactical voting could be key to stopping Tories getting majority: Jacob Rees-Mogg’s sister among Brexit MEPs quitting to back ToriesOutright political lies are now the norm. And I don’t knowwe can ever go back. Chancellor Sajid Javid was at it yesterdaymorning. He told Sky News that the  per cent rise in homelessness since  – when the Conservatives won a majority – was the fault of the Labour Party, who lost power in .The Conservatives have since issued a statement saying that he “misremembered” a statistic, but it was more that he got caught red-handed telling a flipping great fib. And Javid was meant to be one of the saner ones. But maybe there are none. And maybe we don’t want any.Feeding our biasesAll our political parties are indulging in the worst kind of deceit and manipulation. Spin and propaganda have always existed but when you genuinely need to fact check everything our political leaders say, you’re off to the wacky races.But do we actually care  Or are we so deeply polarised and entrenched in our camps that we are happy to feed our not-so-unconscious biases and feast on our daily diet of manipulated truth and misinformation  Do we even bother to fact-check anything as iniduals, or is that prospect as appealing as getting a new quote for your car insurance – because that may be something we all have to think about doing far more in the future.And there’s an interesting generational ide. According to new research by Intuit Research, the older you are, the less likely you are to fact-check a news story. Only  per cent of over-s polled said they would check facts to confirm the truth of a story, compared with  per cent of --year-olds.Given that older people are more likely to vote and lean towards the right and Brexit, you can see why the Tories are shamelessly pushing their fake news marketing to the limit. This is a vital voting group for them, and they are being ruthless.And it’s not just the Tories. Jeremy Corbyn has told us anti-semitism is all sorted. Jo Swinson has told us she’s going to be Prime Minister and is on course for a landslide.I don’t think there is way back. There never was a halcyon era in which the public had unwavering faith in what their politicians said, but we are now entering a Black Mirror world of wilful deception.I once did a  with Brian Stelter, who hosts the show Reliable Sources on America’s CNN. He said the art of fake news is to not tell a ludicrous lie. It was to gently shape the facts so they become what you want them to be. Or to trade in what Donald Trump’s aide Kellyanne Conway famously called “alternative facts” back in early .We laughed then. We are not laughing now. Trust no one.

The rail network is a gt to journalists, like no other area of transport, and not necessarily in a good way.While there are good news stories - like falling crime rates, and lowered fences for baby deer, to give recent examples - too often the industry attracts the opposite type of coverage.Shrinking coffee cupsApart from the perennial fare rises, delays and overcrowding - the booming railways are a victim of their own success - the industry has a propensity for repeatedly shooting itself in the foot.Like Network Rail’s failure to check bridge heights, which nearly forced the cancellation of the newly-restored Flying Scotsman locomotive’s triumphantto Scotland.Or incoming ScotRail Abellio asking staff to cut its predecessor First’s logo off their unorms. Or even First’s stewardship including shrinking the size of coffee cups on trains because it couldn’t cope with demand.Discontented workers and passengers don’t hold back on leaking me the bad news - like the latest ScotRail staff survey results, or its decision to scrap seat reservations. Then there’s the seemingly never ending woes of the new Caledonian Sleeper.By contrast, those responsible for promoting the railways need to up their game because far too often the “positive” news stories I write about rail are ones I have found myself.Perhaps Sir Eric might have recognised the predicament. In his inaugural presidential address to the institute in , he described the railways as the “great predominating factor in transport”.However, he said that despite their modest rate of , they “have figured in the minds of the masses as a great, bloated capitalist organisation, an object not of sympathy but rather of suspicion and jealousy”.A century on, I don’t have such prejudices, and I don’t go out looking for bad - or good - stories about the railways, or any other forms of transport, despite what some vocal conspiracy theorists claim on social media. I’m also not looking for ways to criticise - or praise - Sir Eric’s successors as transport ministers or the governments they serve.I’m just looking for interesting stories that our readers will find compelling, unexpected oruseful. I remain keen to hear from whistleblowers when things go wrong, but I’d equally like to receive new and interesting information from those who want to champion the railways.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"some working parents simply can t make things work that must change kelly ann woodland","story":"While there has been some progress in helping working parents, it can still be tough to juggle children and a career, writes STV News at Six presenter Kelly-Ann Woodland.Returning to work after a career break is tough going. Throw a teething baby and a brand new role into the works and it’s an emotional rollercoaster. A tiring, guilt-inducing, fraught, high-speed rollercoaster of a ride that never slows down. On the one hand, you get to go to the toilet by yourself at work. On the other, there’s a good chance you have a Cheerio in your hair. Many organisations are changing rapidly to ease ing to work and there are support groups out there to build confidence and help with the military-style planning that’s needed to balance work and family le. The opportunity to front flagship news programme The STV News at Six came when I was on maternity leave with my second son. I was six months in, with my head firmly focused on my kids. But this was my dream job and one I’d worked hard for. It would mean more hectic days, considerable planning, a y commute, a live show and a race home to put the kids to bed. So, was I right to go for the job I’d wanted all my le, despite the timing  Absolutely. For me, this was about making the right choices for the kids in the long-term and setting a good example. I wanted them to see you can go for the big jobs, irrespective of obstacles.: This is how maternity and paternity leaves around Europe compare: SNP unveils ‘game-changing’ plan for  weeks ‘Daddy leave’After clinching the job, I focused my efforts on trying to achieve that much-coveted work-le balance. I had a positive conversation with STV where we agreed new hours so that I could do the nursery and school run in the morning. I’d recommend going to employers with a reasonable but flexible plan and being open to a conversation about how you can both make it work – and thankfully, STV were receptive to this.As a family, we figured out a childcare plan, with my husband adapting his schedule and taking on afternoon pickups. I spend half my commute on the phone, organising the kid’s schedules. Loads of those calls are to my mum, who I’m very thankful to say is a godsend, especially when the kids are unwell.Exhausted before hitting motorwayLike loads of parents, there are mornings when I feel exhausted before I’ve even hit the motorway. And I’m not even going to get into the scrutiny of the appearance of women on screen, especially one who’s been woken up several times in the night before going live to half a million people each night. It simply shouldn’t matter.Alongside millions of other working parents, I’ve so many balls in the air and sometimes they come crashing down. I’ve still not managed to strike that perfect balance but a flexible working policy, an understanding boss, a support network and good childcare all help enormously. I’m trying to get into mindfulness, because self care is important too.There are many working parents with way greater demands on them, and many can’t make it work. There’s still so much more progress to be made. We need increased awareness that working parents can reconnect with their working self, they haven’t lost all their skills amidst a sea of babygros and sleep deprivation and should be encouraged to have a realistic conversation with employers about what works for them.If you see a job or promotion that you think is right for you, don’t be put off by the fact you’re on maternity leave. Be bold, be brave and seize the opportunity.

Blog PostBut in a blog post on its website, the Cockburn Association claims the gardens must be treated as “a public park where events are tolerated, not a performance area surrounded by gardens”. A new blog post on its website states: “We remain concerned that no detailed business plan outlining how the facility will be used and how often is available. “This is key as any intensication of use or further commercialisation of the gardens is unwelcome.”Cockburn Association director Terry Levinthal said: “The scale of the centrepiece – the pavilion, amphitheatre and Welcome Centre – will be read as a single entity as one approachesfrom west or east. Whilst it will be permeable in one sense – you can walk though it – visually it will read as a unied development spanning the gardens from the railway to Princes Street. “In effect, it will ide the gardens into two. Whilst the current bandstand undeniably presents a barrier, it is not on the same scale so has a lesser impact.”David Ellis, managing director of the Ross Development Trust, said: “Over the next two months we are working to incorporate feedback from the public consultation and will present the next stage of plans in late February.”Edinburgh World Heritage director Adam Wilkinson said: “It is essential that any intervention within the Waverley Valley respects its integrity and preserve its role as what Sir Walter Scott called the ‘great arena’ between the Old and New Towns.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

Wealth and power imbalances stop people with erse lived experiences from interacting, negotiating and working to understand each other, but more importantly to negotiate a common good that is equitable. “We should never forget that much of our own culture and infrastructure is a product of imperialism and dominance. Built on tobacco and cotton harvested by enslaved people, profits from people starved and forced off their land, or backbreaking heavy industries, Glasgow has the opportunity to create a new future.”The blueprint – which envisages Glasgow being “globally recognised as a leading creative and cultural world city” – highlights how it is now home to  dferent cultural organisations, including the national orchestra, theatre, opera, and ballet companies, and is also “blazing an internationally acclaimed trail in contemporary art, design and music”.However, it also states that although culture has been “central to Glasgow’s evolution for at least  years, the city should not be constrained by so much reverence for the past that the new can never become established”.A spokesman for Glasgow Le, which runs cultural venues for the council, said: “This new plan has been developed to build on all that the city has achieved and is a starting point for a renewed conversation led by Glasgow’s creative community.“We want to consolidate Glasgow’s position as a truly international arts capital – nurturing and showcasing the best in local and international creativity, design and music.“We would encourage anyone with a role in the sector to respond to the draft plan and have their say during the consultation period to help shape the final version.”David McDonald, deputy leader of the city council and chair of Glasgow Le, said: “Our new draft plan seeks to set out what the city can do to ensure that culture in Glasgow continues to flourish over the next  years.We know that participation in culture – whether it’s watching a play, creating your own piece of art or singing a song - is a force for good, and an enabler of community empowerment that can increase our quality of le. In Glasgow, we have a vibrant cultural sector that gives the city an edge. It inspires, questions and challenges us to see our city and the world in dferent ways.Having just been named as the UK’s top cultural city we need to now create the conditions in which our confident cultural sector can develop and grow, and where our artists are nurtured in their work.”For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy.

In , we look forward to seeing the development of the Roddy McCorley Society Museum and interactive visitor’s centre. “Of course, in the early part of  we hope to see permission granted to allow Casement Park to be granted, which will be an absolute game-changer. “We see the continued growth of Féile an Phobail, we hope to have Michael Conlan back in the Falls Park to win a world title, and we look forward to the enormous event that will be.”Commenting on the latest figures, outgoing West Belfast MP and Fáilte Feirste Thiar Chairperson, Paul Maskey, said: “When you look at the numbers it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Other parts of this city are now looking at West Belfast to learn and to see what lessons they can take from it moving forward. “Fáilte Feirste Thiar is engaging with organisations in other parts of the city to help them do that.“Tourism is vitally important for our economy in West Belfast and it is sustaining many jobs in the area, and that includes restaraunts, shops, bars and clubs.”He added: “We want to increase those numbers in the time ahead, and it is our job to do that.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38762803.ece/f83d8/BINARY/abodl002.jpg","title":"in pictures apprentice boys gather in derry for shutting of the gates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They werent getting the same experience and I didnt think that was fair.\"Brian has now been on a Secret Santa mission to make his weekend grotto at the popular shopping complex a Winter Wonderland for all.\"Christmas should be an enchanting time for all children and I wanted to make sure everyone goes away with a smile on their face. They should all be able to enjoy it,\" he said. \"And by all, I mean all.

I also taught myself some Christmas signs, just enough to help me hold a conversation with a child.\"The thought of seeing the look on their faces when Santa speaks to them in their own language spurred me on.\"Brian likes nothing more than giving children of all ages the best Christmas experience, and also decided to discard the fake beard.\"If anyone comes in and tries to lip read, they cant see my lips,\" he said. \"The fake beard also muffled words for the hard of hearing. I thought a real beard was the right thing to do.\"I tried it last year by starting to grow it in September but it wasnt thick enough. This year the beard growing started in May.\"My we actually hates it,\" he joked.\"But shes putting up with it until Christmas Eve.\"Thats when its coming off. Shell have the real smooth me for a few months before I start growing it back for next year!\"Brian first pulled on the famous red suit for his daughters playgroup  years ago and went on to rope his children in as elves, making it a real family affair.\"Once I pulled the red suit on that first time, I was hooked. I was Santa and I loved the feeling of bringing such joy,\" he said.\"I have three daughters and theyre all in their s now. \"We loved Christmas as a family and they embraced the role as Santas elves, but theyre a bit too big now.\"I have two grandchildren now and they might join in when theyre old enough in a couple of years time.\"Brians grand-daughter was diagnosed with autism five years ago and another string to his Santas bow is the Silent Santa sessions at Bloomfield Shopping Centre which he runs at weekends ahead of Christmas.\"I got involved with the National Autistic Society in Newtownards, and that made me think about the kind of experience children with autism were having when they went to see Santa,\" he said. \"I know from experience that you need to give them a little more time, even just a few seconds, to build more of a connection with them.\"The noise, the colours, the bright lights and the crowds can all be too daunting for children with autism. Thats why we started the Silent Santa. \"I dont want parents to think they cant bring their kids to see Santa for any reason. \"We make it a safe, fun and friendly place for them to visit.\"His autism-friendly Santa sittings were along the first of their kind in the UK when he started them seven years ago and the commitment will go even further next year.\"Me and my we plan to complete a course in Makaton so that we can cater to even more children and adults with special needs - its all about them at the end of the day andwe can make them happy for just  minutes during our wee chat then we go home happy,\" he added.\"I want to be able to treat all the children who come to see Santa exactly the same. \"Its not a job for me, its the best feeling in the world that I can bring this much happiness to children.\"Indeed, Brian is so committed to his Santa role that he saved his annual holidays up from his normal job with Bombardier.\"I always make sure I have enough days of holiday in December to do this,\" he said.\"I need a week or two clear at this time of the year.\"Brian clearly puts a big effort in to make Christmas for everyone , and said it is a fine substitute for watching his own children grow up and leave the magic of Christmas in his own home a happy memory.\"Christmas should be the most wonderful time of the year,\" he added. \"Theres enough rubbish going on in the world around us these days so why cant we just enjoy a little bit of festive joy \"Its not just about the presents, the parties and the food. Its about spreading a bit of happiness, putting a wonderful smile on a childs face. Thats what makes me do this year after year.\"My own kids have grown up now and as a family at home the festive season had lost a little of its sparkle.\"By doing this Im getting that sparkle back.\"If you can bring a little bit of that Christmas spirit to just one child, and maybe a child who hasnt seen it before, then its worth the effort. Theres nothing better than seeing that magic in their eyes. You know youve enchanted them, made their Christmas a little bit special.\"I dont carethe line to see Santa is out the door orits half an hour past closing time, I will always give each child the time and patience that they expect from Santa no matter how long it takes me.\"Brians Santa is in high demand around north Down and it will be a busy couple of weeks before he can pull off his boots and hang up the red coat.\"I think my we, Mrs Claus, is probably most looking forward to me finally shaving,\" he said. \"Well be Brian and Jacqueline after Christmas Eve again.\"But once you pull on that suit you have to actually be Santa, its no good just looking like him.\"At Bloomfield Shopping Centre, they have been delighted with the effect their extra special Santa is having on families.A spokesperson for the centre said: \"The kids come in to see him and we all watch them go nuts.\"Hes such a wonderful Santa and does whatever it takes to make each visit special.\"Hes been rolling about on the floor making the children laugh and he takes such care to spend time with everyone. No child can say their visit wasnt magical.\"Weve seen parents leave with tears in their eyes.\"You can visit Brians special Santa in his cottage outside Tesco at Bloomfield every Saturday and Sunday until December  with an extra special final day on Monday, December .Silent Santa will be available for visits from am-noon on Sunday, December  and .All gts and photos free though donations can be collected for the Helping Hand charity at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His dogged determination wins many friends - and that is an odd thing about Strangford. It is a friendly election campaign, full of genuine conversations, with election posters kept to a minimum. So close to Belfast, but so dferent in attitude. data-dfpadtargetingJim ShannonAnother factor stacking against those lining up to challenge the DUP in Strangford is that only in north Antrim did a greater percentage of voters opt to vote Leave in the  EU referendum.For Shannons closest challenger, capitalising on the voters who have switched their European view from Leave to Remain will be key.\"Were in this to give Jim a good run for his money,\" said Kellie Armstrong. \"He has a strong majority and we respect him for that, but weve been slowly eating into that.\"The local government elections gave us a surge. Ive been finding that a lot of people, particularly from the farming community, who had voted to leave the EU are now thinking that this is their chance to show that theyve changed their mind.\"Issues such as health and education are concerns. Though theyre devolved matters, people are starting to think that a stronger voice at Westminster will help speed up aof the Assembly.\"Mr Shannon, however, remains the key factor in the constituency.Indeed, he was singled out for his hard-working approach by DUP leader Arlene Foster at last weeks party manesto launch.\"Its Shannons to lose - its just a question over what the majority will be,\" said Paul Symington, editor at local newspaper The Newtownards Chronicle.\"Alliance have made good gains and its a question of whether they can continue that surge, but Jim has an enormous personal vote.

People Before Profits Gerry Carroll is also aiming to repeat his achievements in recent elections.This constituency has seen signicant development in recent years, including the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, but it is still pockmarked by high levels of unemployment and deprivation.However, West Belfast has also largely reinvented itself as a tourism destination, turning the Troubles into an attraction.Ads for the area urge tourists to \"visit Clonard Monastery with its sumptuous Rose window\" and \"walk up Divis or Black Mountain and be spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat afterwards\".The internationally popular Lonely Planet guide says: \"Though scarred by three decades of civil unrest, the former battleground of west Belfast is one of the most compelling places to visit in Northern Ireland.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet data-dfpadtargetingFrank McCoubreyGerry Carroll\"The Falls Road and Shankill Road are adorned with famous murals expressing local political and religious passions, and are ided by the infamous Peace Line, separating Catholic and Protestant communities.\"The glossy language and hyperbole mask an area still scarred with social problems, including the highest poverty levels in Northern Ireland.A tongue-in-cheek letter to the Irish News last month poked fun at the achievements and verbal ability of the abstentionist Mr Maskey, who has held the seat since Gerry Adams decided to run in the Republic.The mischievous letter drew a reply a few days later, questioning the original letters veracity, but there is little doubt Maskey will romp home. He enjoys the largest majority of any Northern Ireland MP.What he may lack in vocal dexterity he more than makes up for on social media, tweeting last week that Santa had taken a few hours off to support striking health service workers \"who had all been good boys and girls this year\".Mr McCoubrey, the veteran DUP candidate, also has a Twitter account, which tends to retweet Nigel Dodds a lot, but he came second place to Mr Maskey last time round.Mr McCoubrey also pushed Mr Carroll into third after the People Before Profit man slashed Mr Maskeys majority two years earlier and amassed % of the vote.Mr Maskey said his recovery was \"no fluke\" but was down to hard work and delivery.Major talking points within the constituency include proposals for  new homes at the Glenmona site near Upper Springfield and the failure after more than , days to get planning approval for the new Casement Park plans.Mr Maskey has been vocal on both issues. \"I have families who have been on waiting lists for up to nine years. The shortage of social housing is one of the biggest issues,\" he said.\"I have pointed out to planners that applications lodged after Casement have been approved. It will be the jewel in the crown of West Belfast.\"Big-ticket issues such as Brexit are also to the fore. West Belfast had the second highest vote for Remain in the  referendum .Ongoing violence is also an issue, however.Two weeks ago, a family had a lucky escape after an air freshener exploded on top of a wood burning stove, a few days after a pipe bomb was defused in a front garden.Mr McCoubrey has claimed the unionist vote in the area has almost doubled in recent years, leaving the DUP \"knocking on the door\" in West Belfast.Mr Carroll has also insisted that his aim is to win the seat, though his campaign will also be seen as a dry run for the next Assembly election.Alliance candidate Donnamarie Higgins said the constituency needed a strong pro-Remain voice and argued change is possible \"when people vote for it\" as they have in a pro-Alliance surge which saw the party take the third MEP seat this year.New party Aontu will be interesting to watch, particularly in terms how many votes it can take from Sinn Fein.Candidate Monica Digney said: \"Irish MPs north and south  years ago did not stand idly by like Sinn Fein do today. They refused to go to Westminster but went to Dublin, which is what we will do, demanding the right to represent people here.\"SDLP stalwart Alex Attwood has, after many years of struggle, left the battleground and, apparently, politics altogether.His long-serving councillor brother, Tim Attwood, polled just under , votes in the constituency, a fall of %, and came in fourth.The constituency has expanded in the recent past, taking in Dunmurry and the northern part of the Derriaghy council ward in , but the change did not affect the proportion of Catholics to Protestants.

Im confused about claims that I havent reached out. The DUP condemns paramilitary flags, but I try to sit down with people to address issues rather than just jumping up and down about them.\"Over in the liberal and increasingly Catholic Rosetta area, residents certainly dont see their DUP MP as a bridge-builder. At many doors shes denounced in a way that youd expect in republican Belfast, not in this middle-class and moderate district.SDLP candidate Claire Hanna doesnt bring her rival up, but voters do. \"I cant stand that woman Pengelly,\" a female householder says. \"I want to wake up on December  to find the nightmares over and we have a new MP.\"A pensioner says: \"Shes not our MP, she never was our MP. In the two years since she was elected, Ive not seen her once around these streets.\"SDLP candidate Claire HannaHannas canvassers meet outside The Frying Squad chip shop. Its by no means purely an SDLP team. Two Green Party activists and two former Womens Coalition members are there.The candidate needs to secure support from outside her partys usual voting base, and the evidence from the doors is that shes doing that.\"I normally vote Alliance, but youll get my preference this time because I think youre the person to oust our current Westminster representative\" a man tells her.\"If you lend me your vote, Ill look after it,\" Hanna pledges.A Co Armagh teacher says: \"I usually vote People Before Profit, but Im with you in this election. I hope Enmma Little-Pengelly comes to my door so I can give her a piece of my mind.\"Hanna is warm and chatty as doors are opened by busy parents putting kids to bed or mums already in their pyjamas.SDLP candidate Claire Hanna speaks to Tim and Elsie Trainor on their doorstep in Ardenlee Avenue\"Id be in mineI wasnt out here doing this,\" the candidate says. Many know her from the school gates or parks. Others have seen her whizzing about the area on her bike.One woman asks who will succeed her as South Belfast MLAshes elected to Westminster. \"There will be an internal party contest. Weve a lot of bright young things who will be eager to take the Assembly seat off me in a heartbeat,\" she explains.A pensioner advises her that she should fight this election not just by knocking doors, but on social media as well. \"I dont know anything about it myself, but you must get on all those sites the young people are on Claire,\" she urges.Michael Westland offers a cup of tea and more. \"There are five votes in this house, Claire, you dont need to ask,\" he says.Youre one of the few intelligent politicians on TV. Youre logical, rational and you dont tell lies.MichaelThe compliments for Hanna come so thick and fast at the doors - \"You echo what I think\", \"I trust you\", \"You keep my faith in politics\" - that its almost embarrassing for her.She blushes and jokes to one voter that all the praise means \"its like being at your own funeral\".On a two-hour canvass, there are only three out-and-out noes for the SDLP woman. One family is solid DUP. A man looks at the SDLP leaflet through his glass door and shakes his head. Another man opens his but the conversation is brief. When asked by Hanna what the big issues are for him, he replies: \"My dinner!\" She admires the handsome Christmas wreaths bursting with pine cones and blood-red berries hanging from many doors. Election demands mean shes behind on the Christmas front herself, \"although the kids do have an Advent calendar, and the decorations are out but not up\".Over in the religiously mixed middle-class Sicily Park in Finaghy, Alliances Paula Bradshaw is setting a brisk pace. Its late afternoon and most householders arent in, but she posts signed and timed leaflets through their doors.Alliance’s Paula Bradshaw Privately, she must be annoyed that almost every journalist and commentator is putting Hanna ahead in the Alliance-SDLP race for the Remain vote. Yet admirably she doesnt complain.\"Im not taking it personally and I can understand why Im not the favourite to win this seat. I think I would have been had the pact between the SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Greens not happened,\" she says.\"But I would argue that Alliance cant be written off. We match the DUP in South Belfast in terms of councillors. We both have eight to the SDLPs four, and unofficial figures from Mays council election put us on % in the constituency with the DUP on .% and the SDLP on just .%.\"The Green Party may have stepped aside and endorsed Hanna, but Bradshaw claims that its voters arent listening.\"I havent met a Green supporter yet who is going SDLP, theyre all voting Alliance,\" she says.And she questions just how many Sinn Fein voters will come out for the SDLP. \"Ive found apathy about the election in the Lower Ormeau and the Market,\" she claims.\"There are also a fair few DUP voters telling us theyre disillusioned with the party - that its made a hames out of Brexit and theyre fed up with the scandals. Some are coming over to us, others arent. Theyll just stay at home.\"Voters at two homes in Sicily Park give off to the Belfastabout the DUP - one over Brexit and another over the health service. Three members in the latter household work for the NHS and arent impressed - to put it mildly - with Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and the DUP candidates husband.Alliance’s Paula Bradshaw talks to a constituent as she canvasses in Newtownbreda\"South Belfast is being very East Belfast in this election,\" says Bradshaw. Normally, its residents are reticent in expressing their preferences, but theyre shooting from the hip this time round.Paula Bradshaw\"Alliance are going great, although we dont really have strongholds. Somewhere like Stranmillis is excellent for us, but theres no place that well come in with % of the vote. Our strength is that we poll solidly across the constituency.\"Bradshaw reports the issues raised on the doorsteps as \"health, no Stormont, Brexit and abortion\"in that order.At one house, a woman praises Alliances stance on equality issues. Shes confused over Brexit. She supported Remain, her husband was a Leaver. She tells Bradshaw shell consider voting for her.But a few doors down, a woman is undecided about how shell vote and says shell wait to see what her husband does. \"Ive heard that at a few doors,\" the Alliance candidate says.Although Bradshaw will poll well, this feels first and foremost like a Hanna-Little-Pengelly fight.

In this election, we have an opportunity to send voices and votes to Westminster that can stand up for us and stand against the DUP. \"In this election we simply cant afford the luxury of voicing a strong protest. Turning your back on Brexit and ignoring it wont prevent it from happening. Preventing it means facing it head on - it means voting against it. It means voting for people who will go to work and vote against it. \"There is a real risk thatthe same pattern of results repeats itself in this election, only the DUP will take seats and hold sway in Westminster.\"I can think of no stronger motivation to go out and vote.\"He said it was fortunate \"that there was a lone voice but a strong voice during the last two years\". \"I want to use this opportunity to pay tribute on behalf of the SDLP to Sylvia Hermon who has decided to stand down,\" Mr Eastwood said.\"Sylvia may have been surrounded by the DUP but she was never silenced by them. When Sylvia Hermon spoke, she spoke for all of us. None of us viewed her through the silos of the traditional ide in Northern Ireland - she was our remain voice and she will be badly missed.\"Mr Eastwood said the election \"is a chance to maximise the Remain representation across Northern Ireland\". \"That is what motivated the SDLP to take a lead in making that ambition a reality and removing as many damaging DUP votes as possible,\" he said.\"That was a choice not about pacts but about protection - protecting us from Boris Johnson and protecting us from Brexit.\"The choice made by the SDLP was to be strategic, not selfish.\"Mr Eastwood dismissed suggestions from Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald that nothing could be gained by sitting in the Commons.He added: \"History doesnt judge those who dont turn up at defining moments - it casts a far harsher verdict. It simply doesnt mention them because they make no dference. You only make a dference by being there.\"He pointed to a number of issues - including fair employment legislation, creation of the PSNI, and pension rights for factory workers - all secured, he said, by his party being present on the green benches.He added: \"Ask anybody who can countthere is going to be a dference made by MPs sitting in Westminster. \"This thing could be decided on the basis of a couple of votes. Brexit is being done to us against our will and Sinn Fein dont want to vote. They want to stand outside, that is up to them.\"Let them tell people,this goes badly, where they were when the battle was being fought. We will be inside facing down Boris Johnston and the DUP and standing up for people in Northern Ireland.\"Like Sinn Fein, the SDLP launched its manesto in Londonderry - an indication of how serious the two nationalist parties view the battle for Foyle, which was decided by just  votes in ."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38646284.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/jfnd.jpg","title":"watch former northern ireland footballer paul mcveigh backs john finucane for north belfast","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These expenses, it said, have now been disclosed.Auditor Deloitte said it had not obtained all the information and explanations it considered necessary for the purpose of its audit of the FAI’s finances.The independent audit, which was commissioned on behalf of Sport Ireland, shows that the organisation has bank loans of . million euro.Deloitte also said it was was unable to determine whether adequate accounting records had been kept and were also unable to report the disclosure of the directors’ remuneration and transactions.The FAI had previously stated a profit of . million euro for , however after adjustments of . million euro were made, they reported a loss of . million euro.Fine Gael’s Noel Rock said the “stark accounts” of the FAI pose major concerns as to whether it can continue toand meet its liabilities.The Dublin North West TD said: “These accounts published today display huge debt burdens and come against the backdrop of the FAI losing its most lucrative commercial contract.“It is a dark time for the administration of football in Ireland.“There are numerous questions now that have to be answered about their financial obligations, commercial arrangements and how they intend to continue to .“Deloitte clearly decline to state that it is a going concern.“This is a signicant development as it will mean the FAI will find it dficult to obtain refinancing for its existing debt obligations.“This is a concerning development for football fans.

The Bus Pass Elvis Party official #Brexmas card out now! pic nAsCeGhMS— factchecked by my catDecember , He said one of his “most popular” policies is “free neutering for stray cats and Boris Johnson”.Another issue which he says “really gets him going” is the reduction in the number of public lavatories and has pledged to replace the public toilets which are being closed.Other manesto issues include legalising brothels which Mr Bishop argues will make it safer for women, imposing a speed limit on cyclists using footpaths and improving daytime television.Mr Bishop stood in the Nottingham City Council by-election for Clton North under the Bus-Pass Elvis Party.Yorkshire PartyThe Yorkshire Party is fighting for the north which they argue has been failed by major political parties and deserves better.The party, founded in , is led by former primary school teacher Chris Whitwood. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Yorkshire Party candidates standing in the General Election with leader Chris WhitwoodIt has  candidates contesting the General Election right across Yorkshire, which is nearly double that of their first general election in .Mr Whitwood said the party is seen as a “positive alternative” and attributes its growth to the feeling by the community that it has been neglected by major political parties in Westminster.“It’s an acknowledgement that for so many years Westminster has let down the people of Yorkshire and the north of England as a whole,” he told the PA news agency.“There’s a feeling that Yorkshire does deserve better.”Mr Whitwood pointed to the recent floods in the area as an example of how the area has been neglected while the South East is favoured.“Two years ago the Government was told flood defence spending plans favoured the South East and then when the floods did hit it took days for the prime minister to recognise that it was a national emergency by which time whole towns were under water, people were homeless and someone actually died,” he said.The Yorkshire Party leader said transport was another issue for the region and a key part of the party’s manesto.The party also supports the Brexit referendum but will push for a free trade agreement for Britain.Women’s Equality PartyThe Women’s Equality Partywants to move beyond the MeToo movement to tackle the cultures and systems awash with violence and abuse against women.The party, which has five candidates contesting the General Election, praises the MeToo movement for giving a  to women who have been abused, but said it is time to move further.“We need that movement to go beyond inidual stories and tackle the inidual cultures and systems,” leader Mandu Reid told the PA news agency.“You could look at what we’re doing as a continuation, as the next wave of the MeToo movement.”The party’s five female candidates are all survivors of abuse and violence and are standing in constituencies where the sitting MPs have been accused of violence and harassment.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Women’s Equality Party leader Mandu Reid Ms Reid said this “guerrilla approach” reflects their priority to end male violence against women and girls.Ms Reid said four of the sitting MPs they stood against announced they would not be re-contesting in their constituencies.The party has also offered to stand aside in some constituenciesother parties adopt their key policies.Ms Reid said it has been a “brilliant success” with the Liberal Democrats agreeing to adopt the WEP’s key policies and in exchange the WEP candidates have stood down in two seats.“In a guerrilla indirect way we are exerting influence over what the parties are doing,” she said.“This is an opportunity to prioritise ending violence against women which is a crisis in my view.”The party has three key manesto policies including amendments to the Recall Act to allow constituencies to remove MPs found guilty of harassment, sustainable funding for refuges and front line services and universal free childcare.The WEP is against Brexit.Animal Welfare PartyThe leader of the Animal Welfare Party is concerned the General Election will be dominated by Brexit and climate change will be pushed to the side.Leader Vanessa Hudson said about the December  vote and Brexit: “Sadly I think climate change will come second in people’s list of priorities.”The Animal Welfare Party, founded in , has six candidates across the UK with most standing in London.Ms Hudson said while the party is a dedicated voice for animals, it is also a party for the planet more broadly.“Other parties might say we are a single issue party but we’re not, others will be focusing on human issues and the human population but there’s an elephant in the room,” she told the PA news agency.“It’s not just people, it’s animals and the farm animal population.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Animal Welfare Party leader Vanessa Hudson campaigning in Bethnal Green and Bow To address climate change she said people need to look at the way they are feeding themselves which is why the Animal Welfare Party’s number one manesto policy is to lead the UK to a plant-based food system.Other manesto policies include increasing penalties for animal abuse, ending the badger cull, strengthening the fox hunting ban and ending live exports.On Britain leaving the EU, the group opposes a hard Brexit and supports a second referendum on a final exit deal.Asked how the party is dferent to the Green Party, Ms Hudson said: “We would say the Green Party have a lot of great issues on animals … but for us the reason many of us entered politics, we’ve all come to this as we feel animals needed a dedicated voice, someone who solely focuses on animal issues”.Christian Parties AllianceThis General Election the Christian Parties Allianceis focusing on one main seat – Walthamstow – and disrupting the sitting MP’s fight to decriminalise abortion.The Christian Party Alliance has  candidates standing in the election – many of which are in London.Party leader Sid Cordle said their campaigning will be focused on the north-east London district of Walthamstow against Labour candidate Stella Creasy.Ms Creasy is a vocal campaigner for abortion rights and supported efforts to bring about a change in the law to see abortion decriminalised in Northern Ireland which the CPA disagrees with.“To us it is morally totally indefensible,” he told the PA news agency.“I felt that for this election we should still stand as many candidates as we can but focus campaigning all in one seat.”The party, founded in , has five main policies in their manesto which include protecting unborn children and fighting crime by working with people when they leave prison to reduce re-offending rates.They also support honouring the  Brexit referendum and giving grants to people who get married and for their first child.The Peace PartyThe Peace Party is going into this General Election campaigning that remaining in the EU is vital to maintain peace across Britain.The party’s leader John Morris, who is one of two candidates standing in the December  poll, said the group is in favour of Britain belonging in the EU.“In the present situation we would go along with the idea of revoking article  and stopping the Brexit process,” he told the PA news agency.“The EU is vital for the maintenance of peace.“My parents lived through two world wars, I lived through one and my children and grandchildren haven’t … That’s a bit of a clue of how important I believe the EU is towards the maintaining of peace.”Mr Morris, who is this year contesting Guildford in Surrey, said it is clear what the party, which was founded in , stands for from its name.The EU is vital for the maintenance of peaceJohn MorrisHe said there are two ways to define peace, with his party supporting “positive peace” which means society is working in such a way that it supports everyone in “all ways possible”.The party’s key manesto policy is conflict resolution which includes campaigning for peaceful conflict resolutions, disband the armed forces, decommissioning all weapons and withdrawing from all current military commitments.Other policies include using the proportional representation election system, legalising the sale, distribution and use of psycho-active substances and repealing legislation that prevents prisoners from voting."},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

The SDLP Spokesperson on Agriculture was commenting on the end of the previous UK Government commitment to match the current total level of cash funding for the sector during a transition period.Mr McGlone said: “For the farming sector leaving the EU means leaving the EU funding mechanisms behind as well.“The total allocation of EU funds to Northern Ireland’s farming sector during the period – was €, million, with €, million of that total in Direct Payments to farmers.“For a number of reasons - farms located in Less Favoured Areasand a much higher proportion of cattle and sheep farms - farmers in Northern Ireland receive, on average, higher levels of direct support than farmers in other areas of the UK.“The previous UK Government’s promise to match the total level of cash funding for the farming sector here during a transition period to new support mechanisms ended with the end of that government.There is no guarantee that a new government will renew that commitment.“The UK Agricultural Bill, intending to replace the EU funding mechanisms, failed to make it through parliament before the General Election was called and will have to be reintroduced by any new administration.“In addition, the Agricultural Bill was designed with English farming practices and conditions in mind.The funding provided through the Block Grant will be for the implementation of the rules and regulations it sets out. Any deviation from those regulations would be for a NI Assembly to decide.In the absence of a ing Executive those decisions would be taken by an unaccountable Civil Service.Any additional costs introduced by those decisions will have to be met from the existing Block Grant.“Continuing to maintain current levels of support for the farming sector here after Brexit, with or without a Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and the EU, will therefore result in increasing pressures on the finances of any devolved administration.“That will mean Northern Irish famers competing for resources with health, education and infrastructure in order to match the EU support available to farmers where on this island.“The only way to avoid this future uncertainty is to stop Brexit now.And the only way to stop Brexit is toMPs to Westminster who will vote against Brexit.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It also contains contact and other information on all of the Diocese’s  parishes across Derry, Donegal and Tyrone. “The aim is to communicate effectively with all of those currently active in parishes as well to encourage those who want to reconnect with their faith or enquire about their local parish.”The Derry priest noted that one of the key themes of the Diocesan Pastoral Plan is: ’To Make Jesus Known and Loved.’ He continued: “As well as the new website being a reference point for information about parishes, priests and organisations, it seeks to be a tool for evangelisation. Events that are happening around the diocese will be publicised, and good news stories shared and the faith of the people of the Diocese will be nourished.“People will be able to find details of upcoming events at parish and diocesan level Mass times, details of clergy, and ious organisations at work within the diocese and across Ireland that are associated with the Catholic Church. “People will also be able to stay up to date with the Diocesan Pastoral Plan as the Diocese works towards the Diocesan Assembly in .“The website also has links to external sites where people can find out more about their faith and what we believe and why. We look forward to people looking at the website and giving us their feedback.” In tandem with the new website, the Derry Diocese has also developed another online page, dedicated solely to the development of Vocations for men and women. www.derryvocations.orgcan be accessed directly from diocesan website, and also as an independent domain.Fr Chris Ferguson, director of vocations, said an important part of the Diocesan Pastoral Plan is highlighting the importance of vocation. He added: “As Christians, we believe every person has received a personal calling from God, which we are asked to respond to throughout our lives. “In Baptism, every person is welcomed into the community of God’s people. We all have a part to play in Jesus’ mission to bring healing and mercy. “ In a desire to create a culture of vocations, the vocations website is designed to help people question and celebrate their calling in le. The website has been created to provide information and support to those seeking to discover who God is calling them to be, and what path in le might bring them true contentment and happiness.Both websites are now live and can be accessed at www.derrydiocese.org and www.derryvocations.org googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Having an ice scraper and de-icer in the car will save you so much time. Youll arrive at work on time, far more calm and collected and you wont need to order a new credit card! Fully charged mobile phoneIts even more important to have your mobile charged when youre driving in winter so that you can reach out for helpyou need it and also be contacted yourself.

Hi-vis clothingIf you do have to get out of the car either to wait for help or perhaps clear snow, you need to be seen.

Whats worse is that you have to spend the next  mins scraping your car with a credit card and waiting for the ice to clear! Now youre late for work and stressed! Having an ice scraper and de-icer in the car will save you so much time. Youll arrive at work on time, far more calm and collected and you wont need to order a new credit card! Fully charged mobile phoneIts even more important to have your mobile charged when youre driving in winter so that you can reach out for helpyou need it and also be contacted yourself. If your car has a USB charger then keep a mobile charger lead in the car so you can charge your phone as you go. If your car isnt that fancy then there are lots of gadgets on the market that will do the same usually using the cigarette lighter as the charging point. If youre a member of a breakdown service then have their number to hand. You usually receive a card to keep in your wallet when you sign up as well as a members booklet that you can keep in the car. googletag.cmd.push Warm clothingStuck on the M, a truck has broken down and you dont want to keep the car running while youre sat in traffic because youre a little low on petrol. Brrrr. If only youd packed your down jacket, fleece, hat and scarf, youd be so toasty right now ! Keep a bag of warm clothing items in your car during winter. You just never know. Blanket or travel rugAnother useful item to keep you warm and comfortableyou get stuck in cold weather. It could come in really usefulyoure travelling with children or the elderly. googletag.cmd.push Food and snacksThe glove compartment is a good place to keep some snacks to keep energy levels up and blood sugars in check. Protein cereal bars are a good choice and easy to store. A couple of chocolate bars and some bottles of water will stand you in good steadyou find yourself not moving. Hi-vis clothingIf you do have to get out of the car either to wait for help or perhaps clear snow, you need to be seen. With less daylight hours in winter it can get pretty dark quite quickly in the evenings so a hi vis jacket or vest will mean youll wont be missed by other drivers. Snow shovel and a broomAnother piece of kit youre going to be so grateful for when you wake up in the morning and theres been heavy snowfall during the night. At home or away a snow shovel and broom will come in really handy to clear your path and get you on your way. Our telescopic snow shovel is an ideal space saving item to pack. De-icing saltSalt to throw on the ground will really help speed up the process to get all that snow out the way and you on the road.Snow chains or snow socks for your tyresIf the weather really takes a turn for the worse then snow chains or socks for your tyres will help keep you moving in snow or icy conditions. They will help increase your grip on snow and ice to allow you to get to cleared roads. You can use our helpful tool to find the right snow chains for your car here and its a good idea to practice putting them on and removing them. You can always pop in-store and we can advise you! Study boots and a set of ice gripsWhen theres snow to be cleared and ice to be scraped, a pair of flip flops isnt going to cover it. Have a strong pair of boots to hand and you wont be slipping and sliding around. Plus, youre feet will stay nice and warm! Emergency warning triangleIf your car does breakdown then an emergency warning triangle placed  metresbehind your broken-down vehicle on the same side of the road will alert other vehicles that youre ahead. Be careful when youre retrieving it. Tow ropeHaving a tow rope in the car during winter can get you out of some tricky situations whether your car needs to be towed after a breakdown or another driver needs some help. Jump leadsJump leads are useful to have in the boot of your car all year around but particularly in winter when your battery might start to complain during the winter months. Tyre inflatorWith all those nasty conditions, the roads can take a bit of a bashing in winter, which can mean an increased risk of you getting a puncture. If the tyre isnt completely blown then having a tyre inflator will mean you can add some enough air to get you to your destination. First aid kitA just in case item because you never know what the winter weather is going to throw at you. Halfords sell dferent kits from basic to a full pc set. Its a good idea to have a First aid kit in your car at all times during the year. TorchPack a sturdy torch for winter driving.

My clients mean everything to me because without them I wouldnt have a business.Id like to personally thank each and every one of them for nominating me and all the support and kind words they have shown me since I won.Im just completely over the moon and I will have a smile on my face for a long time to come.April travelled to Dublin on Sunday for the glittering ceremony of the third Irish Beauty Industry Awards which recognises the champions of the industry.More than  of beauty professionals from across the country gathered at The Crowne Plaza Hotel to celebrate their success. Despite fierce competition “Glimmer N Gloss by April” was crowned winner in the Outstanding Makeup Artist of the Year category and took the trophy home. Irfan Younis, chief executive of Creative Oceanic who run the awards, said: “The beauty sector plays a vital role in the country’s economy and enhances the local community by employing hundreds of staff. “The Awards showcased those who promote excellence, set the trends and turn any dream look into reality. These specialists inspire others when it comes to the big and competitive world of beauty. “We would like to congratulate all finalists and winners for their achievements and we hope that they will keep up their amazing work.” April added: It was one of the proudest moments of my le and without all my lovely clients it would have never been possible. I was so honoured and I had an amazing night celebrating with my husband and two of my close friends.”April concluded: My plans for next year are to keep training because the beauty industry is always changing and its important to keep up. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The event at Littlehands SureStart in Rosemount was to promote the importance of registered childminders For the last  years NICMA has been delivering support services for Registered Childminders who provide , day care places for children across Northern Ireland. Teresa McKeever, a Registered Childminder from Derry, said she gets great satisfactionfrom what she does. “I love childminding. I’ve been doing the job for less than a year, although I have been involved in the childcare sector for over  years. Every day I have a real sense of job satisfaction. You can really see children grow, develop and learn. Childminding plays a transformative role in children’s lives. The training, checks and visits are critical to keep the children safe and it’s only what you would expect,you were leaving your child with someone to ensure peace of mind. googletag.cmd.push “As a Registered Childminder, I am professional in my approach and I am committed to continuous personal development and training. I would encourage others to consider childminding as a career. It is so rewarding and the flexibility it offers means you can choose how many hours you wish to work every week.” Patricia Lewsley-Mooney CBE, NICMA CEO, commented: “The Festive Bake Off is just one part of a wider programme of activity which has been organised to encourage parents to consider the many benefits that come with using a Registered Childminder to care for their children. At the event, children will be baking healthy treats and doing some Christmas crafting. These are the type of creative activities Registered Childminders do on a daily basis with the children in their care. googletag.cmd.push “It is important that parents think about their choice of childminder. We know that parents ultimately want to keep their children safe, and some parents will feel that they have a choice to make between using a Registered Childminder or an unregistered childminder. However, quite simply there is no choice. The law is very clear, anybody looking after children for more than two hours a day, for reward, must register with the Health and Social Care Trust. Registered Childminders will have completed Access NI Checks on all iniduals in the household over the age of  and will have Public Liability insurance cover. “A Registered Childminder will also be required to update mandatory training every threeyears. They will be registered by the Trust and inspected on an annual basis by Early Years Social Workers. These checks help to keep your child safe, so you really should carefully consider who is looking after your child. In addition, NICMA provide advice and work in partnership with other organisations such as Family Support NI and the Western Childcare Partnership , who detail local services and information to support you and your family.” Throughout this year and next the Western Childcare Partnershipwill be supporting the awareness campaign to which it is hoped will also promote childcare as a career option to address the decreasing number of childcare places within the area and also to challenge unregistered childcare within the WCP locality.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show. I had never done one that quick before and on the day I was hoping that I would be able to get it finished.Emma said that she got her love of crafting from her grandmother, Violet Spence, who still competes as a member of Drumbo Womenrsquos Institute, and her mother, Linda Davies, who kept the tradition going.Emma can be contacted on Facebook and Instagram as Emma Phillips Handmade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 4%2C 1979  ","story":"STRIKE mdash The bin strike in Down District has ended and normal bin collections have resumed. The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses. Every trader in the town signed the petition.At their last meeting committee members agreed to ask Mr Powell to take up the fright. He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality. The pound, illuminations were erected by Mr Sean Murnin and his son, Paul.ARDGLASS mdash One womanrsquos battle to collect enough money for two kidney machines took a giant step forward in Ardglass this week.She is Mrs Winnie Cully, of Portavogie, and she was in Ardglass to collect two cheques totalling almost pound from fishermen, fish salesmen and friends in the port.The first cheque for pound came from the skippers of  Ardglass fishing boats and was handed over by Mr James Smyth, while the second cheque for pound was from six fish salesmen and three friends. It was handed over by Mr Willie Williams.Already the gold-hearted Winnie has raised pound,, but she still needs another pound before she can present two kidney machines to Belfast City Hospital.She started fund-raising two years ago when her son was on a kidney machine at the City Hospital. ldquoSince then he has had a kidney transplant, but I have my heart set on raising this money for the machines to help someone , she said.LISTOODER mdash Listooder and District Ploughing Society held their th annual competition on Saturday and were fortunate to have excellent weather, good ploughing conditions and a record turnout.These all helped to create a big interest for both spectators and competitors, making it one of the best the society has held. For the first time in the history of the society one judge travelled from England to adjudicate.SHRIGLEY mdash A quantity of leather coats valued at pound, were stolen when the offices of the Ulster Leather Company at Shrigley were broken into. The thieves gained entry by smashing a window and made off with  coats.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar War Memorial Hall was packed to capacity for a concert organised by Wellington Memorial Silver Band.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead. Man of the match Lyons found room out on the left flank, left two defenders for dead and drilled a low effort past McDowell to make it -. Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield. And the Ballynahinch men had another great chance after a great run by Mason down the right wing.His cross found Jones free with only the lsquokeeper to beat, but Dillon ed to his right to save one-handed and gather the ball with  minutes remaining.But just two minutes later Olympic were celebrating a second goal as Molloy met a Jones corner to head home what proved to be the winner.Olympic had to survive a late scare when they conceded a free kick on the edge of the D in injury time, but Sterlingrsquos shot was blocked, as was the follow-up from Briers, epitomising the determined defensive work of Olympic that was a feature of the game.Rathfriland needed penalties to see off East Belfast in the other semi-final, after it finished -, with their lsquokeeper Jonny Parr the hero as he saved all three East spot kicks.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Ryan Noade, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Shane Murray, Ryan Molloy.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

If this is the first time you have subscribed to emails from JPIMedia Ltd, the publishers of Belfast News Letter, please check your inbox to very your email address.  .html.valKilkeel ratepayers have been relieved to lose their crown for the worst Christmas tree in Northern Ireland, after their council replaced a display that drew howls of derision from across the province.The famous carol opines that a well decorated tree epitomises the spirit of generosity and cheer of the festive period- “O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, You’ll ever be unchanging, A symbol of goodwill and love, You’ll ever be unchanging, Each shining light, each silver bell, No one alive spreads cheer so well.”However Kilkeel ratepayers - who celebrate ‘Dickens Day’ every year complete with fancy dress as part of the crescendo to the big tree turn-on - felt their local authority, Newry Mourne and Down District Council, had taken more of a leaf out of Scrooge’s ‘Bah Humbug’ Christmas with the budget it allocated..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Because while their neighbours in Newcastle had £, for their tree, Kilkeel got a budget of only £, according to one local councillor. The result was that in Kilkeel, lights were only hung on the lower branches of an old Yew tree in the town square. And when they were finally turned on, as the climax to Dickens Day on November , there was incredulity and laughter as hundreds of disappointed children saw only the underside of their tree lit up.However after province-wide mockery, the shamefaced council relented, and has now erected a tree more in keeping with the famous carol.Ratepayers once again took to social media to express their feelings. Carol Porter said: “Well done. What a dference!!!!” while Dianne Copeland spoke for many when she exclaimed: “Now that’s a Christmas Tree!!!”Ann McKee added: “Its beautul ... much more in keeping with the season of goodwill.”But Kilkeel Chamber of Commerce and Kilkeel Development Association were determined to expose the roots of the problem. They said they had “continually voiced their concern” to the council since the end of October and that it was “regrettable” that it did not listen.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Bus Pass Elvis Party official #Brexmas card out now! pic nAsCeGhMSmdash factchecked by my catDecember , He said one of his ldquomost popular policies is ldquofree neutering for stray cats and Boris Johnson.Another issue which he says ldquoreally gets him going is the reduction in the number of public lavatories and has pledged to replace the public toilets which are being closed.Other manesto issues include legalising brothels which Mr Bishop argues will make it safer for women, imposing a speed limit on cyclists using footpaths and improving daytime television.Mr Bishop stood in the Nottingham City Council by-election for Clton North under the Bus-Pass Elvis Party.Yorkshire PartyThe Yorkshire Party is fighting for the north which they argue has been failed by major political parties and deserves better.The party, founded in , is led by former primary school teacher Chris Whitwood. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Yorkshire Party candidates standing in the General Election with leader Chris Whitwood at the front  --It has  candidates contesting the General Election right across Yorkshire, which is nearly double that of their first general election in .Mr Whitwood said the party is seen as a ldquopositive alternative and attributes its growth to the feeling by the community that it has been neglected by major political parties in Westminster.ldquoItrsquos an acknowledgement that for so many years Westminster has let down the people of Yorkshire and the north of England as a whole, he told the PA news agency.ldquoTherersquos a feeling that Yorkshire does deserve better.Mr Whitwood pointed to the recent floods in the area as an example of how the area has been neglected while the South East is favoured.ldquoTwo years ago the Government was told flood defence spending plans favoured the South East and then when the floods did hit it took days for the prime minister to recognise that it was a national emergency by which time whole towns were under water, people were homeless and someone actually died, he said.The Yorkshire Party leader said transport was another issue for the region and a key part of the partyrsquos manesto.The party also supports the Brexit referendum but will push for a free trade agreement for Britain.Womenrsquos Equality PartyThe Womenrsquos Equality Partywants to move beyond the MeToo movement to tackle the cultures and systems awash with violence and abuse against women.The party, which has five candidates contesting the General Election, praises the MeToo movement for giving a  to women who have been abused, but said it is time to move further.ldquoWe need that movement to go beyond inidual stories and tackle the inidual cultures and systems, leader Mandu Reid told the PA news agency.ldquoYou could look at what wersquore doing as a continuation, as the next wave of the MeToo movement.The partyrsquos five female candidates are all survivors of abuse and violence and are standing in constituencies where the sitting MPs have been accused of violence and harassment. --Womenrsquos Equality Party leader Mandu Reid  --Ms Reid said this ldquoguerrilla approach reflects their priority to end male violence against women and girls.Ms Reid said four of the sitting MPs they stood against announced they would not be re-contesting in their constituencies.The party has also offered to stand aside in some constituenciesother parties adopt their key policies.Ms Reid said it has been a ldquobrilliant success with the Liberal Democrats agreeing to adopt the WEPrsquos key policies and in exchange the WEP candidates have stood down in two seats.ldquoIn a guerrilla indirect way we are exerting influence over what the parties are doing, she said.ldquoThis is an opportunity to prioritise ending violence against women which is a crisis in my view.The party has three key manesto policies including amendments to the Recall Act to allow constituencies to remove MPs found guilty of harassment, sustainable funding for refuges and front line services and universal free childcare.The WEP is against Brexit.Animal Welfare PartyThe leader of the Animal Welfare Party is concerned the General Election will be dominated by Brexit and climate change will be pushed to the side.Leader Vanessa Hudson said about the December  vote and Brexit:ldquoSadly I think climate change will come second in peoplersquos list of priorities.The Animal Welfare Party, founded in ,has six candidates across the UK with most standing in London.Ms Hudson said while the party is a dedicated voice for animals, it is also a party for the planet more broadly.ldquoOther parties might say we are a single issue party but wersquore not, others will be focusing on human issues and the human population but therersquos an elephant in the room, she told the PA news agency.ldquoItrsquos not just people, itrsquos animals and the farm animal population. --Animal Welfare Party leader Vanessa Hudson campaigning in Bethnal Green and Bow  --To address climate change she said people need to look at the way they are feeding themselves which is why the Animal Welfare Partyrsquos number one manesto policy is to lead the UK to a plant-based food system.Other manesto policies include increasing penalties for animal abuse, ending the badger cull, strengthening the fox hunting ban and ending live exports.On Britain leaving the EU, the group opposes a hard Brexit and supports a second referendum on a final exit deal.Asked how the party is dferent to the Green Party, Ms Hudson said: ldquoWe would say the Green Party have a lot of great issues on animals hellip but for us the reason many of us entered politics, wersquove all come to this as we feel animals needed a dedicated voice, someone who solely focuses on animal issues.Christian Parties AllianceThis General Election the Christian Parties Allianceis focusing on one main seat ndash Walthamstow ndash and disrupting the sitting MPrsquos fight to decriminalise abortion.The Christian Party Alliance has  candidates standing in the election ndash many of which are in London.Party leader Sid Cordle said their campaigning will be focused on the north-east London district of Walthamstow against Labour candidate Stella Creasy.Ms Creasy is a vocal campaigner for abortion rights and supported efforts to bring about a change in the law to see abortion decriminalised in Northern Ireland which the CPA disagrees with.ldquoTo us it is morally totally indefensible, he told the PA news agency.ldquoI felt that for this election we should still stand as many candidates as we can but focus campaigning all in one seat.The party, founded in , has five main policies in their manesto which include protecting unborn children and fighting crime by working with people when they leave prison to reduce re-offending rates.They also support honouring the  Brexit referendum and giving grants to people who get married and for their first child.The Peace PartyThe Peace Party is going into this General Election campaigning that remaining in the EU is vital to maintain peace across Britain.The partyrsquos leader John Morris, who is one of two candidates standing in the December  poll, said the group is in favour of Britain belonging in the EU.ldquoIn the present situation we would go along with the idea of revoking article  and stopping the Brexit process, he told the PA news agency.ldquoThe EU is vital for the maintenance of peace.ldquoMy parents lived through two world wars, I lived through one and my children and grandchildren havenrsquot hellip Thatrsquos a bit of a clue of how important I believe the EU is towards the maintaining of peace.Mr Morris, who is this year contesting Guildford in Surrey, said it is clear what the party, which was founded in , stands for from its name. He said there are two ways to define peace, with his party supporting ldquopositive peace which means society is working in such a way that it supports everyone in ldquoall ways possible.The partyrsquos key manesto policy is conflict resolution which includes campaigning for peaceful conflict resolutions, disband the armed forces, decommissioning all weapons and withdrawing from all current military commitments.Other policies include using the proportional representation election system, legalising the sale, distribution and use of psycho-active substances and repealing legislation that prevents prisoners from voting..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: General Election: What minor parties are standing this year  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
