One views it as a supreme exercise in composition, like an abstract painting: the photograph is ided into three vertical sections – road, buildings and rooftop – each delineated by contrasts in sunlight and shadow. The image is a photographic equivalent of the modernist architecture it celebrates, dwelling on concrete geometries.In the other way of seeing, the eye fixes on the four figures on the roof. The cityscape below and its teeming traffic becomes a vertiginous backdrop to their curious, elongated silhouettes. The four are cast in an apparently conspiratorial drama that demands to be understood. What is their purpose up there? Why are three of the figures in step behind the man ahead? The shot looks like a still from a film – but the tone is elusive.Speaking about the photograph – a highlight of a forthcoming Magnum print sale – not long before he died in 2014, Burri described how it came about. “Did I know those men were there when I took that photograph? No. Buildings weren’t guarded in those days. It was a question of getting to the top and knocking on the door… ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come in!’ So I walked out on to the terrace and, at that moment, those guys came from nowhere and I shot five images.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/049cbbfe9f84db138f67084660900492971532f4/80_13_1716_1030/master/1716..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b94e7a7514800b5b81361402c767c4f","title":"behind the iron curtain the final frontier soviet space art in pictures","story":"With more than 250 artworks sourced from cold war-era Russian magazines, Alexandra Sankova’s book Soviet Space Graphics: Cosmic Visions from the USSR (Phaidon £24.95), produced with the Moscow Design Museum, explores “the dream of conquering space”.One of the most vibrant publications was Tekhnika Molodezhi (Technology for the Youth) its “unearthly palettes of pink-violet and ochre-scarlet colours”, says Sankova, pulling readers into stories of “inventions and innovations, the mysterious and unknown”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1677cd65157509df2b9df479976e4f1adfa3135b/0_105_3200_1921/master/3200..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e217983d1834e86d0b8f68c1d379f58","title":"bondi beach how the australian icon became a coronavirus hotspot","story":"Bondi is one of NSW’s most famous destinations, drawing 2.6 million visitors a year. Has its popularity made it vulnerable to Covid-19?A block from Bondi Beach six female travellers, all aged between 22 and 31, share a two-bedroom flat, each paying $200 a week in rent.They came to Australia, and settled in Bondi, for the work opportunities, the sun and the freedom.Last week, two of the women tested positive for Covid-19.The Sydney beach suburb draws 2.6 million visitors each year, according to Destination New South Wales. It’s a place of contrasts. Sparkling natural bounty and dense urban living. Billionaires and backpackers. Instagrammed bodies and old-timers’ swimming clubs. A place obsessed with health and beauty but now, one of Australia’s Covid-19 hotspots.Bondi, part of Waverley council area, has taken a heavy hit from the coronavirus, the local council’s 159 cases as of Friday (101 of them in Bondi alone) knocking the sunshine out of the surfside playground.This week, in response to Waverley’s newfound status as home to both the highest number of Covid-19 cases and the highest number of locally transmitted cases in the state, the government opened a local pop-up testing clinic. While the advice during the global coronavirus pandemic is to stay home, the reality for some, especially in a place like Bondi, is that crowded living conditions make physical distancing difficult, even for the most prudent.“I couldn’t believe I was negative, I slept in the same room as two positive girls,” says one of the Argentinian housemates who was given the all-clear, who did not want to be named. “I was staying home, worrying about the virus outside, but it was in my own place.”Unsure where to turn, she appealed to the authorities for help and her infected housemates – one of whom is suspected to have caught the virus in the house – were moved into quarantine in hotels, paid for by the government.For the others, a sense of gratitude has settled on the flat: they and their sick housemates are safe and isolated, friends are helping with food deliveries and a neighbour has lent them exercise equipment. She has heard of worse, including newly jobless, homeless travellers who cannot get to their home countries, and infected members of shared houses who have stayed put.They’re like many temporary working visa holders who continue to share cramped homes, some of 12 to 15 people, across the suburb. Since 20 March, hostels, meanwhile, have had to comply with new distancing rules of one person every 4 sq metres. At Noah’s Backpackers, just along from James Packer’s erstwhile beach house, every room, including six-bed dormitories, were made single occupancy.The landmark building has a view down on to the Bondi Beach that is usually alive with crowded surf and its famous lifeguards. On 21 March, the beach was closed, its entrances hastily fenced off. With no surfers and sunbathers, Bondi Beach has never looked so bare. Now in the spotlight as the centre of Australia’s coronavirus outbreak, the suburb has never felt quite so exposed.The scene is a far cry from images just over two weeks ago, when crowds from well beyond Sydney’s east took to the sand on a 36C day, flouting social distancing rules and the new 500-person limit on outdoor gatherings. A hot Friday with family-friendly surf is what Bondi does best – but by the next afternoon and in the glare of global media, police were sweeping the beach of sunbathers, forbidding even surfers to enter the water. For the first time, the beach known around the world as an icon of Australia’s natural beauty and symbol of our love of the sea and sun is now associated with something far less glamorous. When New South Wales chief health Officer Dr Kerry Chant singled out backpackers and their potential to infect the community when outlining the response, she directed public focus towards Bondi’s reputation as a destination for travellers, already in the headlines because of a coronavirus cluster traced to a tropical-themed party at a popular Bondi beachfront bar.From Noah’s Backpackers, the view is bleak. A few weeks ago, the hostel was bustling with 266 guests. Now, it’s desolate, with manager Dylan Tenbrink closing its doors last Wednesday, saying it was “impossible” to stay open under the new regulations around social distancing as well as media scrutiny. Unfounded rumours of a positive case of the virus in the hostel were unfairly targeting backpackers and the result was fear among both visitors and the community, he says.With a young, international demographic and thousands of daily visitors, Bondi’s infection rate comes as little surprise to local photographer and Aquabumps gallery owner, Eugene Tan. He has photographed Bondi Beach at daybreak for the last 21 years, and the daily surf photos are known worldwide.“Bondi’s a brand, everybody knows it. You come to Sydney, you come to Bondi. It’s a welcoming place,” he says. It’s that spirit that might have landed Bondi in the situation it’s in today.“The police cleared the beach on Saturday and then all the bars filled up. It’s a melting pot, which I love, but Bondi gets out of hand easily – we have a lot of travellers and they have a carefree attitude.”But to point to the backpacker community alone as responsible for local infection rates is to miss the reality of Bondi’s broader community.The suburb has long been home to professionals and young families from all over the world and less than half of its population is born in Australia, with many residents from Europe, South Africa, America and Brazil. At a local childcare centre where a parent tested positive for the virus, children speak Italian, French, German, Swedish, Hungarian, Russian, Chinese, Spanish and Italian. Long-haul travel, responsible for bringing the vast majority of Covid-19 infections into Australia but also for connecting expats with their families, is as much a way of life as the beach.The Waverley mayor, Paula Masselos, says it is the kindness of the community and its adaptability that stands it in good stead for the future. “We are all in this together.” Brand Bondi, after all, reaches well beyond its bay and, to Tan, its pull is stronger than ever. He has been receiving messages from people all over the world telling him how images of Bondi are keeping them sane during lockdown.“Without the beach,” he says, “you feel a bit lost.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44696f643d6518b696de5d6d62490c30862972c5/0_86_3500_2101/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25a37719e264c530d11a413c26b1bbaf","title":"cath kidston to call in administrators amid coronavirus lockdown","story":"Major firms such as Next and Primark stop taking deliveries as smaller firms such as Cath Kidston face collapseFashion retailers and their suppliers are braced for a massive shake-out of the industry as an estimated £10bn of clothing piles up in warehouses during the coronavirus lockdown.Retail insiders said major firms including Primark, Peacocks, Arcadia and Next had all stopped taking deliveries to their warehouses because they had no more room. Numerous poorer performing retailers, including Debenhams and vintage-inspired retailer Cath Kidston, are on the verge of collapse.Many brands continue to trade online. But some, including Next and Moss Bros, have been forced to close even those operations because of difficulties in protecting workers picking and packing goods in warehouses from infection. Even those companies able to sell online have seen a big slump in orders as the nation lives in its pyjamas and sweat pants during the lockdown.Suppliers and warehouse operators said there were urgent negotiations about how to house about two weeks worth of stock currently on container ships heading for the UK.One major high street clothing supplier told the : “Springsummer season has been cancelled. People will try to reuse stock next year but they will have to slash prices to try and generate cash and some styles will no longer be relevant.Another industry insider agreed that discounting was unlikely to clear stock. “No one buys T-shirts in the winter. The industry has lost a season,” the source said.In the past week it has emerged that both Debenhams and Cath Kidston are preparing to call in administrators, putting thousands of jobs at risk in the already battered retail sector.Cath Kidston, which has 60 stores in the UK and a further 180 overseas, has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators, a legal process which protects the business from creditors for 10 working days, as it considers potential rescue options. The company employs 941 people in the UK, 820 of whom were furloughed on 22 March under the government scheme.Advisory firm Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal (A\u0026ampM) was appointed last month to help Cath Kidston seek a buyer as the British brand, which opened its first store in 1993, struggled to make a profit for its Hong Kong-based owner Baring Private Equity Asia.Coronavirus lockdowns in the UK and elsewhere have only added to the difficulties and it is understood that even if a buyer is found, the rescue is likely to involve a pre-pack administration.A Cath Kidston spokesperson said: “The notice of intention forms part of the process by which Cath Kidston is continuing to work with A\u0026ampM to explore all options for the company in the current climate.”Debenhams is preparing to call in administrators after the struggling department store was forced to close all its outlets under the lockdown while Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group, the owner of Topshop and Miss Selfridge, is expected to permanently close hundreds of stores as it suffers from competition from the likes of Asos, Boohoo and Primark.The lockdown has added to existing pressures on retailers from the consumer switch to online shopping and rising costs from business rates coupled with the fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 Brexit vote.Fashion brands have been hit particularly hard as young people switch from spending on outfits to alternatives such as digital subscriptions and mobile phones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e783034b7ce02589a49941a503383985b748458b/0_329_768_461/master/768..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5428c68f477eff03906af8eacf802fc3","title":"step up to the plate people helping sustain uk food supply","story":"Iniduals and grassroots groups are working to provide fresh produce amid coronavirusThe sight of UK supermarket shelves being stripped bare in a matter of days and farmers warning that lack of workers could cause produce to go to waste has highlighted how quickly food supply chains can be disrupted.Though supermarkets have introduced rationing and panic buying appears to be on the wane, there is lingering uncertainty about what to expect in the weeks and months ahead. Some food producers and suppliers have acted quickly and creatively to try to ensure fresh food remains available across the UK.Here are some of the people and grassroots initiatives trying to make a difference.Planna Fwyd – Welsh for plant food – is a community project in the Dyfi Valley in mid Wales.The project organises a variety of food production initiatives, from Zoom lessons for first-time crop growers to sending out seed packets for families to grow in their gardens, and has about 100 local people involved. The group also plans to organise a second world war-style “land army” of volunteers to work on farms, with about 30 people signed up and plenty more showing interest, out of a town of 2,000 people.The project was born three weeks ago, after Mach Maethlon, a community organisation working to improve food supply and sustainability in the local area, joined up with the local coronavirus aid group in an attempt to combat fears around a food shortfall.“After the crisis kicked off, we got lots of people saying they were worried about food supply, and asking if they could help,” said Katie Hastings, one of the group’s coordinators. “We had a range of people, from families wanting to turn their land to veg, to farmers wanting to grow food on empty land.”The group are having to reckon with social distancing regulations, ensuring that volunteers can work collectively and share toolswithout putting each other at risk. People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.“We’ve been trying to work to improve the food supply here for eight years, and have had a sudden burst of enthusiasm. We import a lot of vegetables here, and while the project came in response to fear over food supplies, it will hopefully have a positive ongoing impact after the crisis,” Hastings said.The group also hopes to help those in isolation. “There are a lot of people at home struggling with not working and being isolated. If we can work out a safe way to work on farms, it gives them the chance to do something meaningful,” Hastings said.Reeve the Baker was established in 1952 in Barford St Martin, a village six miles west of Salisbury in Wiltshire. These days the company has 200 staff and 12 shops dotted around Wiltshire, Dorset and Hampshire.One hour after Boris Johnson announced the UK lockdown, its owner, Gary Reeve, grandson of the bakery’s founder, Harold Reeve, closed all the shops and furloughed most of the staff. “It was the hardest decision of my life,” he said.“I could have stayed open, we’re a food business, but we have small shops and enforcing social distancing would have been a nightmare. My staff were worried too.”People rely on the bakeries and he did not want to let the community down so came up with a plan to deliver bread instead. Five bakers work overnight and bag up rolls and bread that is then taken by one driver to 20 surrounding villages. Each village has a designated weekly delivery day.Reeve relies on local businesses that have been temporarily forced to close, such as the Wyndham Arms pub in Dinton, to organise orders. “It couldn’t be done without the village coordinators,” he said.“The landlady, Mary Gibbens, takes customer orders and card payments over the phone and we drop off once a week and people in the village collect from her. She knows everyone and makes sure all the elderly and vulnerable get their supplies.“We’ve gone back to how it was when my grandfather was baking bread. He would deliver to villages too. The community spirit we’ve encountered has been amazing.”In addition to the deliveries there is a pop-up shop in the town of Wilton twice a week. Jacques van Doornewaard is a lorry driver bringing fruit and vegetables from the Netherlands to the UK. He travels about three times a week bringing goods including pears, strawberries and mushrooms to British supermarkets.According to Van Doornewaard, Britain’s shelves would run out of fresh produce within a couple of days without supplies from countries including the Netherlands.“If the supply chain of food was disrupted for 24 or 48 hours, all shops would be empty,” he said. “Without truck drivers everything would come to a standstill.“It’s much quieter than usual. The ferry’s capacity is 280 lorries, and on a quiet day there are about 105. Yesterday, on the ferry there were less than 50 drivers. We have to eat in shifts to maintain social distancing.”Van Doornewaard used to deliver to food markets, who would sell the produce to restaurants, but this supply chain has closed down in recent weeks. Instead, more produce is going to supermarkets, as staff scramble to fill the shelves.In the past week, Van Doornewaard has delivered 3,000kg of pears to Tesco in Dagenham, east London, and half as many to Sainsbury’s, also in Dagenham, with stops at farms across southern England. He has also delivered mushrooms, strawberries and cheese. Through the week, he returns to collect thousands of empty trays to take back to be refilled in the Netherlands.The UK lockdown is more severe than in the Netherlands, and he has been struck by the emptiness of British streets.As restaurants close their doors, many farmers are struggling to sell their produce to their usual suppliers, while more people are eating at home and struggling to get food from supermarkets.In response to this, Cathy St Germans established Farms to Feed Us, a digital database that connects people with farmers, enabling them to buy fresh food directly. So far, more than 80 farmers, growers and suppliers across the country have signed up. “There’s no shortage of fresh produce on our farms and being fished in our seas,” she said. “There has never been a more important time to eat healthy food and support your local farmers, growers and fishermen.”She added: “We really focus on small-scale farmers and growers, where the ground isn’t having its life sprayed out of it. It’s not just about being organic, the size and ethos of the farms matter.” The group is working with sustainable agriculture organisations including the Biodynamic Association and Pasture for Life to record and share the growers on a database, which can be searched according to area, or product, and can be easily printed for those who are less computer-literate.“I was taken aback by the response, there are so many people reaching out and wanting to know when it was available,” she said. “It was really amazing and really moving – there were so many people wanting to help, from all walks of life and all over the country.”If you have a project or initiative in response to Covid-19 that that you’d like us to know about, please share it here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f66dc421686f0ea35ea92870779cced0f1826a3/0_304_5700_3420/master/5700..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa01801b10230f1ff47aadc80d2277c5","title":"coronavirus lockdown parents meme family whatsapp","story":"Who thought the family WhatsApp group would alleviate our existential dread? Make no mistake: we’re in strange times• See all our coronavirus coverageMy dad’s latest contribution to the family WhatsApp group was a meme. One that he’d forwarded, possibly from another dad. It’s an illustration of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, walking side by side, with the caption: “Back the fuck up Piglet.”It’s not that the global pandemic has caused my 64-year-old father to discover memes it’s more that he’s now come to truly appreciate them. He tells me he has “20 coming in a day, from various sources”. Like a meme sommelier, he’s become very selective about which ones he forwards to the family thread. And his taste isn’t bad. A little schlocky at times, but surprisingly acceptable for someone of a generation whose online presence is largely defined by jpegs of inspirational quotes and below-the-line bigotry. The overflow he sends to my uncle. I imagine the two of them pinging each other the latest corona content, in a sort of quarantined baby-boomer version of tennis.“We’ve got time,” he says, when I ask him why his generation is getting so into memes. My dad isn’t retired, and he’s one of the busiest people I know. So I’m not sure how this applies to him. I wonder if you become more present as you get older – and maybe seem to have more time. Is he living out these “strange times” in a zen state, contemplating each new meme like a teaching of the Dalai Lama?“By the way,” he says, “I’ve joined Houseparty.”In these times of crisis, I’d rather have this irreverent sort of dad than the “hysterically blaming coronavirus on 5G” kind. Although that picture of a train car marked “Covid-19” did somehow make its way onto the family thread. Tweets about parents spreading fake news about how to cure Covid-19 have become a meme in themselves. Like a virus within a virus are the screenshots of mums telling their adult kids to binge-eat garlic, huff bleach or – according to one viral tweet – “put an onion in the corner of every room in the house”.“My mum has a PhD on coronavirus from WhatsApp university,” tweeted one user. Variations on this joke have now been posted by hundreds of other Twitter users.Another character to have emerged is the protective yet slightly deranged mama bear, yell-typing at her cubs to batten down the hatches and listen up because her friend Maureen from Zumba wrote a very compelling Facebook post on the healing power of dishwasher salt. But it’s not just the “gullible mums” disseminating misinformation like sugar-crazed toddlers throwing confetti at a wedding. My partner regularly has to tell off her 75-year-old dad for his factually dubious forwarded emails. (Although his latest offering, with the subject line À méditer, is actually a thoughtful essay on the pandemic, which originally appeared in Le Monde. My French isn’t good enough to understand the full text, but an uninformed glance tells me it’s deeply existential.)There appear to be three types of pandemic parent: the insouciant, the paranoid and the contemplative. Some straddle all three. The insouciant needs to be begged to stop going to the pub, but also creates the best content: the dads dancing with their teenage daughters on TikTok, the mums of younger kids churning out funny tweets about home-schooling. In one TikTok video, a dad acts as a bouncer and a mum a bartender, having turned their garage into a nightclub for their son’s 21st birthday. These creatively supercharged boomers are – dare I say it – making lockdown slightly less terrible. They’re trying so hard to “make the best of a bad situation” and “live, laugh, love” their way through it that – you have to hand it to them – they’re kind of succeeding. Or at least allowing us to forget about the slow collapse of civilisation in viral, 30-second blasts.In the past few weeks, we’ve all seen those irritating references to the great works of art and literature supposedly created during quarantine, such as Shakespeare’s King Lear. What if that video of a dad pretending to be Basil Fawlty while serving his kids dinner is quarantine’s King Lear? There’s certainly nothing more reflective of the zeitgeist than stir-crazy parents dispensing with their inhibitions parents in lockdown are doing the “long suffering but cheerful” thing like never before. This is their time to shine, and we should probably just sit back and enjoy the results.The contemplative parents don’t require as much attention. They’re too busy zenning out to memes, or reading French essays. And even the paranoid parents deserve a break. After all, they’re just trying to help, even if their idea of “helping” happens to be sourcing all of their information on a gravely urgent situation from satirical news sites and anti-vaxx forums. They (accidentally) shitpost because they care.And, remember, not all of us have mums to tell us to beat the virus with a hairdryer. Be patient with yours, she means well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97cc3a5d0977baebbd0306281fe6d45eb25807e5/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19a99d2367c0264e35bc1aea402a85ee","title":"i cant wait for the school holidays i can finally stop doing my kids homework","story":"My special skill is writing at length – and so I have been working on my daughter’s letter to Boris Johnson and advising my son on Shakespeare. Neither are happy about it“It is important,” said an email from the headteacher of the secondary school my eldest attends, “to maintain the distinction of the holidays.” I have never agreed more with any human being.Thanks to Easter, homeschooling is out for two weeks, which means living the same life, only with less guilt and fewer arguments at 10am over whether 9am is a good time to start. Damn right, this is an important distinction.I have solicited expert views on how to homeschool. I have also waxed philosophical about whether or not this is a good time to set your family free from the constraints of formal education and teach them other stuff instead, our own special skills such as how to make Korean-style whipped iced coffee (which they are brilliant at) or how to find something in a drawer. But my lived reality is neither of these things. Instead, it’s an unedifying cycle, where I badger them to at least get their homework out, hassle them into telling me what it is, and then end up doing it for them.The 10-year-old had to write a letter to Boris Johnson, telling him how coronavirus made her feel. She found this inherently droll, given that he actually had it. Like, you would never do that with any other disease. “Dear person with tuberculosis, I want to tell you a little bit about how tuberculosis, which I don’t have, makes me feel.” I said: “Give them a break, they might have set this before he was diagnosed. Anyway, how does it make you feel?” “Nothing. I don’t have any feelings about coronavirus.” “How do you feel about being off school?” “Really? All the time? What about missing your friends?” “Yes, I miss my friends.” OK … “Dear Boris Johnson, I write to you with some ambivalence about the situation facing the nation. On the one hand, it’s great being off school. On the other, I miss my friends …”“How long does this have to be?” “Longer than that. That’s more of a postcard.” This is my special skill, making things longer. This is the work I was born to do. I could do a paragraph wishing him well, and asking about his symptoms. I could tell him about the pets in the household. Frankly, I was on fire, we had a serviceable letter in 10 minutes flat and the only problem was that I’d written it.Next she had to analyse a piece of graffiti: “The people save the people  NHS staff, you are our pride.” What did she think it meant? What slogan would she spray paint on to a wall to show her appreciation for the NHS? “Think you’d have to be a bit more specific, like: ‘Doctors, thanks!’” We agreed that nurses shouldn’t be left out. Then, that we would need some way to get their attention, and landed on: “Oi, nurses and doctors, thanks!” If I had just butted out, and it had been that lame, it would have been fine. But I had basically done it, and it was still that lame.Then I went to harass the 12-year-old, who was answering questions about a speech in Midsummer Night’s Dream, which he claimed not to understand one word of. Oberon had just “forgiven” Titania – why had I put forgiveness in inverted commas, he wanted to know? Well, because it’s pretty gaslighty, drugging someone to fall in love, then being enraged by their infidelity. So I would call forgiveness quite a moot concept. It turned out feminist revisionism was definitely not what he wanted. “Why not?” I asked. “BECAUSE THAT’S NOT WHAT THEY’VE ASKED FOR. LITERALLY NOWHERE ON THIS SHEET DOES IT SAY: ‘WHAT WOULD A FEMINIST THINK OF OBERON?’.” The question, rather, was: “What do Oberon and Titania do next?”, relating to the line: “Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me  And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.”“Well,” I said, “I guess it could mean dancing, given the music. Or it could mean having sex. That’s what people usually mean when they talk about the earth moving.” “There is no way they are looking for the answer ‘Having sex’. I don’t think you even understand what homework is.” “Well, you could put it more formally, like: ‘Dancing, or something a bit more marital.’” My attention then wandered for two seconds, and I turned round to find what he had actually written was: “They could be dancing, or doing something different.” “But … ‘something different’ could be anything. It could be taking the dog for a walk. It’s like saying: ‘I have no idea what they do next.

And in so doing, they ensure that the devastation wreaked by the virus is not equally shared.We can see this in the way that the low paid both disproportionately have to continue to work and are more likely to be laid off in the sacking of an Amazon worker for leading a protest against unsafe conditions in the rich having access to coronavirus tests denied to even most NHS workers.But to see most clearly how societies allow the virus to discriminate, look not at London or Rome or New York but at Delhi and Johannesburg and Lagos. Here, “social distancing” means something very different than it does to Europeans or Americans. It is less about the physical space between people than the social space between the rich and poor that means only the privileged can maintain any kind of social isolation.In the Johannesburg township of Alexandra, somewhere between 180,000 and 750,000 people live in an estimated 20,000 shacks. Through it runs South Africa’s most polluted river, the Jukskei, whose water has tested positive for cholera and has run black from sewage. Makoko is often called Lagos’s “floating slum” because a third of the shacks are built on stilts over a fetid lagoon. No one is sure how many people live there, but it could be up to 300,000. Dharavi, in Mumbai, is the word’s largest slum. Like Makoko and Alexandra, it nestles next to fabulously rich areas, but the million people estimated to live there are squashed into less than a square mile of land that was once a rubbish tip.In such neighbourhoods, what can social distancing mean? Extended families often live in one- or two-room shacks. The houses may be scrubbed and well kept but many don’t have lavatories, electricity or running water. Communal latrines and water points are often shared by thousands. Diseases from diarrhoea to typhoid stalked such neighbourhoods well before coronavirus.South Africa, Nigeria and India have all imposed lockdowns. Alexandra and Dharavi have both reported their first cases of coronavirus. But in these neighbourhoods, the idea of protecting oneself from coronavirus must seem as miraculous as clean water.Last week, tens of thousands of Indian workers, suddenly deprived of the possibility of pay, and with most public transport having been shut down, decided to walk back to their home villages, often hundreds of miles away, in the greatest mass exodus since partition. Four out of five Indians work in the informal sector. Almost 140 million, more than a quarter of India’s working population, are migrants from elsewhere in the country. Yet their needs had barely figured in the thinking of policymakers, who seemed shocked by the actions of the workers.India’s great exodus shows that “migration” is not, as we imagine in the west, merely external migration, but internal migration, too. Internal migrants, whether in India, Nigeria or South Africa, are often treated as poorly as external ones and often for the same reason – they are not seen as “one of us” and so denied basic rights and dignities. In one particularly shocking incident, hundreds of migrants returning to the town of Bareilly, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, were sprayed by officials with chemicals usually used to sanitise buses. They might as well have been vermin, not just metaphorically but physically, too.All this should make us think harder about what we mean by “community”. In Britain, the pandemic has led to a flowering of social-mindedness and community solidarity. Where I live in south London, a mutual aid group has sprung up to help self-isolating older people. The food bank has gained a new throng of volunteers. Such welcome developments have been replicated in hundreds of places around the country.But the idea of a community is neither as straightforward nor as straightforwardly good as we might imagine. When Donald Trump reportedly offers billions of dollars to a German company to create a vaccine to be used exclusively for Americans, when Germany blocks the export of medical equipment to Italy, when Britain, unlike Portugal, refuses to extend to asylum seekers the right to access benefits and healthcare during the coronavirus crisis, each does so in the name of protecting a particular community or nation.The rhetoric of community and nation can become a means not just to discount those deemed not to belong but also to obscure isions within. In India, Narendra Modi’s BJP government constantly plays to nationalist themes, eulogising Mother India, or Bhārat Mata. But it’s a nationalism that excludes many groups, from Muslims to the poor. In Dharavi and Alexandra and Makoko, and many similar places, it will not simply be coronavirus but also the willingness of the rich, both in poor countries and in wealthier nations, to ignore gross inequalities that will kill.In Britain in recent weeks, there has been a welcome, belated recognition of the importance of low-paid workers. Yet in the decade before that, their needs were sacrificed to the demands of austerity, under the mantra of “we’re all in it together”. We need to beware of the same happening after the pandemic, too, of the rhetoric of community and nation being deployed to protect the interests of privileged groups. We need to beware, too, that in a world that many insist will be more nationalist, and less global, we don’t simply ignore what exists in places such as Alexandra and Makoko and Dharavi.“We’re all at risk from the virus,” observed Gove. That’s true. It is also true that societies, both nationally and globally, are structured in ways that ensure that some face far more risk than others – and not just from coronavirus.

After his YouTube videos went viral, he gave up his day job to pursue a full-time career in comedy. He now co-writes and stars in his own sitcom, Man Like Mobeen, the third series of which has just arrived on BBC One (Mondays at 10.45pm).How are you coping with coronavirus shutdown?Still alive innit, so that’s a positive. You’ve got to take the positives where you can because it’s a mad mess out there. We’re being good and following government guidelines. Everyone has to take this seriously. Don’t go out, people. Stay in the house and shag instead.Just before the lockdown, you did standup in the US for the first time. How did it go?A bit weird. When the MC introduced me and I walked onstage, a couple of guys in the front row immediately tutted, folded their arms and started frowning. I took that as a challenge. That’s the beauty of standup. Within 10 minutes you can go from “I can’t believe they gave this Muslim a microphone” to “I love this dude, he’s hilarious”.How would you describe Man Like Mobeen to newcomers?In some ways it’s a traditional sitcom in the vein of Only Fools and Horses, but we felt the show was in a unique position to make you think as well as laugh. We discuss issues like racism, sexism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, police prejudice…Art Malik plays a crime boss in the new series. How was working with him?He’s a legend. Looking at casting tapes, we were like: “If we don’t get Art Malik, the show is ruined.” When he arrived on set, we tried to be clever and discuss how he perceived the role. He turned around and said: “Guys, just tell me what the fuck to say and I’ll say it.”You’ve been called “the new face of British Muslims”. Is that a pressure?It’s impossible to always say the right thing and please everyone. I felt one responsibility and that was to Small Heath in Birmingham – an area often maligned in the local media. I wanted people here to feel proud and identify with the characters. The overwhelming majority were happy, so I am too.Do you get criticism from the Muslim community too?Of course. Usually about swearing. Somebody messaged me on Instagram asking why I’d said “shit”, so I clicked on their profile and there was a clip of Nicki Minaj twerking! The Muslim community is a complicated set of people. All I can do is try to speak the truth.You’re also up against Ross Kemp, RuPaul and David Attenborough…Imagine that party! Let’s set it up as soon as quarantine ends.You launched a scheme for local youngsters to get paid experience on your production team. Why?Our crew are incredible and I love them to bits but they’re overwhelmingly white dudes. I can talk the talk but unless I facilitate it, I’m a paigon, as Stormzy says. We do a good job of representation on-screen but wanted to get working-class kids behind the camera too. A few comedians are former teachers – like Romesh Ranganathan and Dawn French. What makes it good preparation for standup?Broadly there are two types of teachers. Ones who are all about the curriculum and imparting knowledge, then ones who understand that we have human beings sat in front of us who are going through all kinds of shit every day, so let’s chat to them and entertain them. The second type are the ones who become comics. There’s no better training in crowd-work and navigating emotions. That tough gig in America was nothing compared with a year 9 girls’ health and social care lesson. Those girls were danger.Do your former pupils come to gigs and watch you on TV?They do, which is a lot of fun, but they’ve grown up so quick. One girl came to see me recently and her boyfriend looked about 40. I felt like calling the police! Who were your comedy heroes growing up?Eddie Murphy and Dave Chappelle. From the UK, Lee Evans and Peter Kay. Chris Morris is so unique too. But none of them compares with my old dear, who lives next door to me now. Pound-for-pound, she’s the funniest person you could hope to meet. I said the other day, “Mum, we should do a show together” and she was like “Do I look like Romesh’s mum, mate?” There’s no messing with her.The BBC comes in for a lot of criticism. What do you think of it?It’s such a broad-ranging organisation. It’s a fragmented eco-system, staffed by people with completely contradictory opinions. These are confusing times, but without the BBC it would be a lot worse.What’s next for you?I’m trying to write a sitcom about my teaching days. Let’s face it, there’s plenty of time to write at the moment. Right now is the time for creating ideas. Not just for me, but for anyone. If you’re working in an Amazon factory and can’t take much more, download an app called Final Draft and start writing.

Then I found a record of Emma Joan’s birth and it fell into place.”The tunnel was completed in 1841 and the supposed rising sun phenomenon was first reported by the Devizes Gazette a year later. It surfaced from time to time over the decades and added to Brunel’s legend as a genius with a mischievous sense of humour.In April 2017 the line was shut because of engineering work, providing Great Western Railway and Network Rail with a rare chance to observe whether the sun really does shine through the length of the tunnel on 9 April. Teams positioned themselves at the eastern and western ends of the tunnel and waited for the sun to rise. Disappointingly, they had to conclude that it did not quite beam all the way through.This was no surprise to Maggs and others who have analysed the science and concluded that in fact a more probable date for the phenomenon was 6 or 7 April. So he took a different tack. “I thought I’d come at it another way – from the social angle rather than the scientific one,” he said.Maggs began to investigate Brunel’s life and times to try to find out whether 6 or 7 April were significant dates for him. Eventually he tracked down Emma Joan’s baptism certificate, which gave her date of birth as 6 April 1803.Brunel’s older sister, Sophia, was known as a spirited and powerful woman, but Emma Joan tends to be forgotten and was dismissed by an early Brunel biographer as “dim and rather ailing”.Maggs, from Chelmsford, Essex, likes the idea that Brunel might have paid tribute to his younger sister by designing in a trick of the light.But might it just be coincidence? “As to whether he really intended it, I reckon it’s 5050,” said Maggs. “But the fact remains he did have a great sense of fun. It is possible. If he had done it for his birthday and he had been found out he would have come under a load of opprobrium from shareholders. It’s a lovely thought that he did it for his sister.“Whether Brunel really intended this or it was just a happy accident we may never know, unless a scholar someday uncovers a previously unknown letter or document from Brunel either proving or disproving the fact.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/953d663f4df7fda79eb9bee3a7eeeee7f2ab4b6b/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d87ea82cc40dea72bdaf7dc8185a1abe","title":"council leaders call for funding for free school meals over easter","story":"Councils in England have been told they will have to find the money for meals themselvesCity leaders have said some of England’s most vulnerable children could go hungry over the Easter holidays because the UK government is refusing to fund free meals.Councils have been told they can continue to provide free school meals during the break if they want to but will have to find the money themselves.The mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, and the leaders of Birmingham and Leeds city councils, Ian Ward and Judith Blake, have written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, asking him to rethink the policy.They added: “The rapid closure of schools and social distancing measures means families are not well prepared for the Easter break, will have increased difficulty in managing their children and young people and be more vulnerable to the impact of food poverty.”Blake, who is also chair of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board, said: “No young person should have to go hungry, and ensuring vulnerable pupils – including those on free school meals – are provided for is a top priority for councils and schools.“The government’s recent announcement that families of children entitled to free school meals will be eligible for food vouchers is positive news but we remain concerned that the scheme does not cover school holidays.”She continued: “Pupils in receipt of free school meals are not usually entitled to them over the school holidays, but with almost a million more families now finding themselves in financial difficulty as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, schools are stepping up to fill the gap in provision to ensure no young person goes hungry.“Councils are doing everything in their power to put in place local arrangements, but without these costs being covered by the government schools will have to find these resources from elsewhere, such as local food banks.”Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The cost of funding free school meals over the Easter holidays would be relatively modest compared to the billions of pounds which are being rightly injected into the economy at present.”The Labour-led Welsh government is the only one of the four UK administrations that has pledged to fund free meals over the two-week holiday.The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, said: “It’s more important than ever, in these difficult times, that we make sure everyone who needs that extra bit of support continues to receive it.”Dominic Cools-Lartigue, the founder of A Plate For London, who will be helping to feed young people in Tower Hamlets, east London, over Easter, criticised the government’s position and said: “We can’t sit around waiting for the government to realise that children’s hunger won’t go away during the holidays.”The government’s guidance makes it clear that it will be up to councils to fund free school meals in the holidays. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our focus is making sure that the 1.3 million disadvantaged children who would normally have a free school meal on a school day do not go hungry as a result of staying home.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f259ccc6f9e0cb344c168b193f52539e93890bcf/0_131_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1b09fdaf5987ca2b0d644936f48761e","title":"what wildlife can you see from your home coronavirus","story":"If you are locked down in an urban area due to coronavirus, we want to know what flora and fauna you can see from your homeLocked down in a city?

Perhaps we humans are not as special as we would like to thinkI had hoped to interview the plant neurobiologist Stefano Mancuso at his laboratory at the University of Florence. I picture it as a botanical utopia: a place where flora is respected for its awareness and intelligence where sensitive mimosa plants can demonstrate their long memories and where humans are invited to learn how to be a better species by observing the behaviour of our verdant fellow organisms.But because we are both on lockdown, we Skype from our homes. Instead of meeting his clever plants, I make do with admiring a pile of cannonball-like pods from an aquatic species, on the bookshelves behind him. “They’re used for propagation,” he says. “I am always collecting seeds.”Before Mancuso’s lab started work in 2005, plant neurobiology was largely seen as a laughable concept. “We were interested in problems that were, until that moment, just related to animals, like intelligence and even behaviour,” he says. At the time, it was “almost forbidden” to talk about behaviour in plants. But “we study how plants are able to solve problems, how they memorise, how they communicate, how they have their social life and things like that”.Mancuso and his colleagues have become experts in training plants, just like neuroscientists train lab rats. If you let a drop of water fall on a Mimosa pudica, its kneejerk response is to recoil its leaves, but, if you continue doing so, the plant will quickly cotton on that the water is harmless and stop reacting. The plants can hold on to this knowledge for weeks, even when their living conditions, such as lighting, are changed. “That was unexpected because we were thinking about very short memories, in the range of one or two days – the average memory of insects,” says Mancuso. “To find that plants were able to memorise for two months was a surprise.” Not least because they don’t have brains.One of the most controversial aspects of Mancuso’s work is the idea of plant consciousness. As we learn more about animal and plant intelligence, not to mention human intelligence, the always-contentious term consciousness has become the subject of ever more heated scientific and philosophical debate. “Let’s use another term,” Mancuso suggests. “Consciousness is a little bit tricky in both our languages. Let’s talk about awareness. Plants are perfectly aware of themselves.” A simple example is when one plant overshadows another – the shaded plant will grow faster to reach the light. But when you look into the crown of a tree, all the shoots are heavily shaded. They do not grow fast because they know that they are shaded by part of themselves. “So they have a perfect image of themselves and of the outside,” says Mancuso.Science struggles to view plants as active and motivated because its outlook is so humancentric, he argues. One test for self-awareness in animals is whether they can look in a mirror and understand that they are looking at themselves. “Very few animals are able to do this,” says Mancuso. “Humans, dolphins, a few apes and probably elephants. This has been taken in recent years as a kind of evidence that just these few groups of animals have self-awareness.” Mancuso believes this is wrong. “My personal opinion is that there is no life that is not aware of itself. For me, it’s impossible to imagine any form of life that is not able to be intelligent, to solve problems.”Another misconception is that plants are the definition of a vegetative state – incommunicative and insensitive to what is around them. But Mancuso says plants are far more sensitive than animals. “And this is not an opinion. This is based on thousands of pieces of evidence. We know that a single root apex is able to detect at least 20 different chemical and physical parameters, many of which we are blind to.” There could be a tonne of cobalt or nickel under our feet, and we would have no idea, whereas “plants can sense a few milligrams in a huge amount of soil”, he says.Far from being silent and passive, plants are social and communicative, above ground and beneath, through their roots and fungal networks. They are adept at detecting subtle electromagnetic fields generated by other life forms. They use chemicals and scents to warn each other of danger, deter predators and attract pollinating insects. When corn is nibbled by caterpillars, for example, the plant emits a chemical distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate the caterpillars.Plants respond to sound, too, “feeling” vibrations all over. “Plants are extremely good at detecting specific kinds of sounds, for example at 200hz or 300hz … because they are seeking the sound of running water.” If you put a source of 200hz sound close to the roots of a plant, he says, they will follow it. There is no evidence that the human voice benefits plants, although talking to plants may soothe the humans doing it.Another reason we overlook plants’ intelligence is their vastly slower pace of life. In Mancuso’s new book, The Incredible Journey of Plants, we meet the world’s oldest plant – Old Tjikko – a red fir tree whose roots have writhed in the Swedish earth for about 9,560 years. We are also introduced to the ingenious seeds of crimson fountain grass, which choose not to germinate until the conditions are perfect – and can survive for six years while waiting.The main thrust of the book is that plants were the original pioneers and have been forever exploring the planet. Mancuso eschews the notion of “native species” and prizes so-called invasive species above all else. “The more invasive they are, the more I like them, because they are the most brilliant example of the ability to solve problems,” he says. “Invasive species are the most beautiful plants that I can imagine.” For Mancuso, “migration is one of the most important forces of nature. All living organisms migrate. We are the only species that is not allowed to, and this is completely unnatural.” Although new generations of botanists are increasingly embracing plant neurobiology, Mancuso still has his detractors. Last summer, a group of eight plant scientists wrote in the journal Trends in Plant Science that Mancuso and his colleagues “have consistently glossed over the unique and remarkable degree of structural, organisational and functional complexity that the animal brain had to evolve before consciousness could emerge”. Mancuso says that almost all of these botanists are retired. “It’s an older generation of plant scientists that is completely against any notion of a plant as intelligent or behaving. For them, plants are kind of a semi-living organic machine.”The notion that humans are the apex of life on Earth is one of the most dangerous ideas around, says Mancuso: “When you feel yourself better than all the other humans or other living organisms, you start to use them. This is exactly what we’ve been doing. We felt ourselves as outside nature.” The average life of a species on Earth is between 2m and 5m years. “Homo sapiens have lived just 300,000 years,” he says – and already “we have been able to almost destroy our environment. From this point of view, how can we say that we are better organisms?”Perhaps we should try – ahem – taking a leaf out of the plant kingdom’s book. Human societies and organisations are structured like our bodies – with a brain, or a top-level control centre, and various different organs governing specific functions. “We use this in our universities, our companies, even our class isions,” says Mancuso. This structure enables us to move fast, physically and organisationally, but it also leaves us vulnerable. If a major organ fails, it could scupper everything, and top-down leadership rarely serves the whole.Plants, by contrast, “are kind of horizontal, diffusive, decentralised organisations that are much more in line with modernity”. Take the internet, the ultimate decentralised root system. “Look at the ability of Wikipedia to produce a wonderful amount of good-quality information by using a decentralised, diffused organisation. I’m claiming that, by studying plant networks, we can find wonderful solutions for us,” Or take the ethos of cooperation. Plants, say Mancuso, “are masters of starting symbiotic relationships with other organisms: bacteria, mushrooms, insects, even us. Just look at the way they use us to be transported all around the world.” We may think we have the upper hand, but plants may beg to differ.The Incredible Journey of Plants by Stefano Mancuso is published by Penguin Random House USA"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e087e1549936aef4c7593d1c1386937ac2922a/0_359_6000_3601/master/6000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1b89d818f5bba1cc8b85bd8e45ef2f8","title":"thousands to be paid for daytime green electricity use during lockdown","story":"Fall in energy use combined with bright, breezy weather leads to lowest electricity prices in 10 yearsThousands of British homes will be paid to use electricity during the day for the first time, as wind and solar projects produce a surge in clean energy during the coronavirus lockdown.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms.

But the impact of the coronavirus lockdown and the bright spring weather mean some homes will be able to earn money while using clean electricity during the day for the first time.Households which use the Agile Octopus energy tariff, offered by Octopus Energy, were contacted on Saturday to let them know they would be paid for every kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity they use during the sunniest hours of Sunday afternoon.From 11am-4pm, those customers will earn 0.22p-3.3p per kWh to make use of the UK’s abundant clean energy, the company said.Energy bill savings are also likely for homes using variable energy tariffs, which track the wholesale energy markets.A slump in global gas market prices over the last year, combined with the lockdown, caused the wholesale price of electricity on the UK power markets to fall to £28 per megawatt hour (MWh) last week. The electricity market price is down a third from January this year and well below the £44MWh price recorded this time last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5a223d27b4697a7edd0427775ed1e5d0381f85d/0_434_3007_1804/master/3007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e8198fc71724006581a6610e59a698f","title":"down to a vintage tee pulling on a piece of history vintage tshirts","story":"Cool memorabilia, subcultural signifier – and now big business... Why the vintage T-shirt now gets top billingIn the new, rebooted TV version of High Fidelity, Nick Hornby’s Rob, previously played by John Cusack, is a queer woman of colour played by Zoë Kravitz. The nerdish, music snobbery of the original novel prevails alongside jokes about Creed and soliloquies about getting rid of Michael Jackson’s entire oeuvre, vintage music T-shirts are a battleground.A Cheap Trick tee gets ridiculed, a Miseducation of Lauryn Hill one becomes shorthand for Rob’s co-worker’s tastes and ambitions, and an accidentally destroyed vintage Joy Division T-shirt becomes a metaphor for a toxic relationship. Rob herself mixes achingly cool girl grams (cardigans, DM boots, Matrix jackets) with Wu-Tang Clan and Beastie Boys (Licensed to Ill era) tops. Why those bands? “They’re both awesome and represent going your own way whether it’s deemed cool or not,” says the show’s costume designer Sarah Laux.A vintage rock T-shirt obsessive herself (she’s been collecting them for 20 years), she sees the unspoken meaning behind the T-shirt: “They show a level of commitment to the history of music,” she says. “Rob is no different. Having a vintage T-shirt from a classic band is like having a piece of history.”Similarly on HBO’s Insecure, Issa Rae’s character, Issa, has an equally enviable wardrobe of vintage tees: Public Enemy, Nina Simone and Prince. In the show they are used both as an expression of the characters’ personalities and a narrative wink to what’s going on in the plot.“Early on during the pilot process, we talked about Issa’s style feeling nostalgic,” says Ayanna James, the show’s costume designer. “I purchased a few vintage band tees for Issa to wear at the end of the first episode.” James wanted the show to have the T-shirts articulate what Issa was going through. “Specifically during season 2, I would plug in shirts that matched Issa’s mood.”As well as being a fashion talking point, it’s also big business. Pre-loved T-shirts from Wu-Tang or Backstreet Boys can go for £500 or more on resale sites. “There’s a lot of $1,500 band T-shirts out there,” Laux says. She’s seen a Sonic Youth T-shirt go for $2,000. “People are interested in having items of clothing that have lived a life and that are essentially one-of-a-kind pieces.”In 2011, HMV started making extra space for their vintage tee selection, clocking the growing nostalgia market and that music fans would pick up a T-shirt, mug and possibly badge along with the commemorative reissue of their favourite album. “We were seeing a massive increase,” says chief buyer Gary Williamson. In a world lived through screens, there’s more value in the “nostalgia economy” where the connection to the past is of a high premium. Going analogue also plays out in a physical way. “I actually think that the vinyl renaissance is the older sibling of the current T-shirt trend,” says James Goodhead, co-founder of Unified Goods – a bespoke vintage T-shirt company. He says that the visual appeal of vintage T-shirts has a unique quality. “The way cotton and screen-printed graphics can age over the decades can be mesmerising – it really draws you in,” he says.“People want a feeling of belonging to a movement or an era,” says Goodhead. It’s something that Urban Outfitters think about when they consider which vintage T-shirts to stock. “We split them into stories based on what feels like a trend,” says Ruth Higginson, urban renewal buyer for the shop.But it’s not just bands, it’s also brands who are seeing the value in cashing in on nostalgic fetishisation. The biggest sellers at Unified Goods are associated with 90s skater chic, 50s beat poetry icons and contemporary artists. “Most roads lead back to pivotal, subcultural happenings,” Goodhead says. The company curates the eras that they deem relevant: on their homepage are T-shirts featuring the 90s recycle symbol, Panasonic and Mawell T-shirts and a Phantom of the Opera tee.Another consequence of social media is that the fashion cycles have sped up, so trends are coming up quickly and the idea of what “vintage” means has changed. Now when we use the term we’re not just using it in reference to a floral blouse that looks like it’s from the Second World War, we could be talking about a bucket hat from the 1990s or a boxy, shoulder-padded suit jacket from the 1980s. Goodhood recently launched a vintage T-shirt range which showcased old tech logos from Apple to the disintegrating Microsoft square.Co-founder of Goodhood Kyle Stewart thinks that the products will resonate with “anyone who is aware of a brand’s current status and is misty-eyed for the simplicity of brands 20 years ago. The old branding of the vintage Apple products is relatively quaint compared to their contemporary appearance.”More recently, Unified Goods have collaborated with the Tate Modern for the big Andy Warhol retrospective, providing vintage Warhol-related merchandise from the 1970s to the 1990s. What would the prince of pop art have made of the vintage T-shirt trend? “He would have loved it, for sure,” says Goodhead. “These T-shirts have almost become small works of collectible art.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895882edc7da450f06c5f52322069a65db7616b8/542_2204_4931_2957/master/4931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a9b38b1091f49d1efe68f5303c457d4","title":"nigel slater recipes pine kernel and lemon cookies and sultana and cranberry sponge","story":"Baking is always such a comfort, from nut cookies to a nice steamed pudThe first pan of pine kernels went up in expensive smoke, so I watched the second batch of diminutive, creamy-white nuts as intently as a hawk might watch a family of field mice, toasting them until they were evenly pale golden in colour.I folded some of them into a sticky, marzipan and lemon-scented biscuit dough, while the rest were used to freckle the surface once the biscuits were rolled and ready to bake.I played around a lot with the recipe, finally adding enough egg white to allow the cookies to spread like brandy snaps on the baking sheet, their uneven surface pitted with nuts and crystals of almond paste. You could call them biscuits, because the texture is crisp, like ice, their deckled edges shattering when snapped. But the centre is softly chewy thanks to the marzipan, so cookie might be a more appropriate description. Either way, they were what we wanted with a glass of vin santo in lieu of pudding.The following day was altogether colder and a proper pudding was called for. I hadn’t made a steamed pud in an age, so out came the old china bowl, the grease-proof paper and string, and I made a bee-line for the dried fruit shelf in the larder, to make a fat, amber-coloured dome dotted with vine-fruits and tart, garnet-red dried cherries.Eaten an hour or so after baking and these are soft, crumbly and cookie-like a few hours later and they become crisp and biscuity – the sort of thing to serve with coffee or a glass of sweet golden wine. (Dunking is a thoroughly good thing here.) The lemon zest and toasted pine-kernels lend an Italian note. They will keep for a fortnight in a biscuit tin. Makes 15-20 biscuitsLightly toast the pine kernels in a shallow pan until pale gold in colour, then set aside. Break the marzipan into large pieces and put them in the bowl of a food processor, then process briefly to large crumbs.Add the sugar to the marzipan, then finely grate the lemon zest and add to the bowl with 35g of the pine kernels. Process for a few seconds to combine and roughly chop the pine kernels. Stir in the flour. In a separate, medium-sized bowl beat the egg whites until almost stiff, then fold in the crumb mixture, mixing until thoroughly combined.Set the oven at 175Cgas mark 3-4. Line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper. Take 1 heaped tbsp of the mixture, roll it into a ball and then drop it into the reserved toasted pine kernels. Roll the cookie dough in the pine kernels, then place it on the lined baking sheet.Bake for 10-12 minutes until the cookies have spread. They should look slightly under-done. Remove from the oven and leave them for 10 minutes to settle before transferring them carefully to a cooling rack with a palette knife.I find it is best to leave the pudding in the switched-off pot, still covered by its lid, for a good 20 minutes before serving. You will need a 1.5 litre pudding basin, lightly buttered.

Cut the dried figs in half horizontally and place them, slightly overlapping, in the bottom of the pudding bowl.Break the eggs into a small bowl, beat them briefly with a fork, then add, little by little, to the butter and sugar, beating continuously.Mix together the flour, cinnamon, mixed spice and ground ginger. Finely grate the zest of the orange and combine with the flour. Gradually incorporate the flour into the batter, a couple of heaped tbsp at a time. Mix in the milk.Have ready a large, deep pan of boiling water. Put a trivet or similar object in the base of the pan for the basin to sit on. Chop the dates into four and mix with the dried fruits, then stir into the pudding mixture. Spoon into the pudding basin, on top of the figs and smooth the surface. If you are using a plastic pudding basin with a lid, then clip on the lid. If using a china basin, cover with a sheet of greaseproof paper, secure with string or a thick rubber band, then cover the top in foil and secure similarly.Carefully lower the pudding basin into the boiling water and lower the heat to a spirited bubble. Cover with a lid and leave to steam for 2 hours. It is essential to keep an eye on the water level. It should come two thirds of the way up the sides of the pudding basin. Top it up from the kettle as necessary. Remove from the heat and leave the pudding bowl in the hot water for 30 minutes, before removing the paper and foil, running a palette knife around the sides of the pudding and turning it out on to a shallow serving dish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5e1e49cd9ce7a790c3def517b0f5a07a363b836/253_237_5041_3024/master/5041..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4e0dc2d7679fca6c6667af9ddb601b6","title":"west ham plan 30m rights issue to cover revenue shortcomings","story":"West Ham’s board plans to inject at least £30m into the club by launching a rights issue in response to the financial problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic.With English football suspended because of the crisis and Premier League footballers yet to agree to reduce wages, there is growing concern within boardrooms about income. Some clubs have reacted to the postponement of the season by placing non-football staff on furlough.Whether the money raised rises above £30m will depend on how many accept the offer. If they decide not to take up their rights the shares will be offered elsewhere.It is understood the process will take place in May. While West Ham have no financial problems at the moment, that is likely to change if there is no prospect of their season resuming. Clubs are set to suffer serious losses of earnings and have warned players they could lose up to an estimated £1.137bn if the season does not resume. That is partly because they may have to return £750m in broadcasting money if the season is not completed. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200402-57075-gnl.fw.200402.jf.PhilippeAuclair.mp3 West Ham have lost money in gate receipts and broadcasting revenue. Their matches against Wolves, Newcastle, Chelsea and Tottenham were due to be shown on television. West Ham, whose accounts for the last financial year showed an expected pre-tax loss of £28.8m, would also normally be selling next year’s season-tickets now but the club shops are shut.Given that context West Ham are keen to protect themselves. They are in favour of players reducing pay through wage cuts, deferrals or a combination of both. Karren Brady, the club’s vice-chair, has criticised the Professional Footballers’ Association for standing in the way of cuts.“With no date for restarting the league, this is having severe financial implications,” Brady wrote in the Sun. “Bearing in mind the majority of the broadcast revenue goes to pay the players’ wages it is unthinkable that the PFA don’t seem to understand this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9be6559ed7848aa6ab860a02c187a975decc2cb4/0_108_4802_2881/master/4802..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0117048dd8659d7dfe87bd13281f135","title":"open your windows and four other ways to improve the air quality at home","story":"If you’re on lockdown, fresh air at home is vital. Keeping pollutants out of the house is vital – but plants aren’t as beneficial as you may have thoughtIt is an obvious solution, but it works. “Fresh air isn’t the enemy. Open your windows,” says Dr Appelles Econs, an allergy specialist at the Burghwood Clinic. Keeping your windows shut all day will allow chemicals and allergens to build up inside.Even if you live in a polluted city, you are going to have to open the windows from time to time. “You don’t want to be stuck in a house with no ventilation all day,” says Dr Paul Young of Lancaster University. “If you live near a super-busy road, you may not want to have the window open all the time, but you are going to need to ventilate.” Opening your windows at night, when the traffic has lessened, can be a good option.Research by Nasa in the 1980s found that plants do remove toxic pollutants from the air. However, these studies were carried out in closed environments, similar to conditions in space. Back on Earth, plants will improve air quality, but not as much as you may think. “Unless you have a rainforest in your home, the effect can be minimal,” explains Prof Pawel Wargocki of the Technical University of Denmark. “You need to have many plants to see a meaningful effect on air quality because buildings are not fully airtight environments – there is always air coming in from outside.”“When cooking, make sure you have your ventilator fan on,” says Young. “And don’t smoke inside – smoke can hang around for a long time inside.”Consider the products you are using to clean your home. “Even if their containers are firmly closed, cleaning chemicals produce volatile organic components,” says Econs. If possible, keep cleaning products outside the house, in a garden shed or garage. Econs is not a fan of air fresheners or room sprays, for the same reason.Wooden flooring, rather than carpets, may improve air quality. “Many fresh carpets are cured with formaldehyde,” says Econs. “Wooden floors are more healthy by comparison.”Dust mites can live in soft furnishings, such as cushions and mattresses. The faecal pellets they produce can trigger allergy-like symptoms. “Get a barrier mattress cover,” advises Econs, “which can help prevent dust mites from living in your mattress.”“The greatest factor affecting air quality in British households is indoor humidity,” says Econs. Minimise humidity by ventilating – and deal urgently with any mould on the walls.“After showering, remove local moisture,” says Wargocki, by wiping down surfaces and turning on the bathroom extractor fan. And when it comes to washing clothes, try to dry them outside if possible, or at least in a well-ventilated space."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08b5c3dcff82b3b8472382b43b2b4fd3a19071f8/0_1195_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2a3242f98d4f07c721428969bd5c383","title":"steven appleby why i felt liberated when i started dressing as a woman ","story":"The author and cartoonist describes his heartfelt sense of freedom when he began to cross-dress openly all the timeI am a man who wears women’s clothes. The first time it happened was in the mid-70s. I’d recently left school and was a couple of months into an art foundation course at Manchester Polytechnic. I found myself on my own for a weekend in the flat I shared with two fellow students. Bored, I started rummaging down the back of the sofa to see what curiosities – or money – I might find. A moment later I pulled out a single stocking, which I immediately put on. Instinctively. Transgressively. It triggered years of guilt, self-disgust and confusion.So why did I put that stocking on?In the early 1960s, as a little kid, I’d watched my mother dress and, I think, just expected to grow up to be like her. However, I soon came to realise I was a boy, which I accepted… Until in my teens I came across an article in Oz magazine.Oz was a notorious alternative magazine and, as a rebellious, middle-class school kid, I sought out weird music, strange books and publications like International Times and the comics of underground cartoonists such as Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton. The piece in Oz was about a boy who wakes one morning to find himself transformed into a girl. In reality, it was an excuse to publish some titillating erotic photographs, but still… An idea had been planted and from that moment on I wasn’t content to be a boy.After the stocking incident, I started collecting items of girls’ clothing. I remember having a pair of tights and a pink one-piece swimsuit I’d rescued one holiday when my sister was having a clear-out. I kept them hidden at the back of a drawer and, when the compulsion became too strong, I’d wait until my flatmates were out and slip into them. All the while listening for a key in the front door and the creak of feet on the stairs.For years I agonised over why I was obsessed with dressing as a girl. Maybe there’d been a mess-up in my genes, or something had happened during my upbringing? Perhaps, God had made me like this… or maybe I even, somehow or other, decided it for myself. Whatever the reason – and eventually I decided the reason didn’t matter – I found myself floating through my late teens and 20s wishing I’d been born a girl and dressing as one in secret whenever the urge became irresistible. Afterwards, I’d be filled with feelings of sadness, fear and guilt. Sadness at being back in the real world of my male self fear of being discovered, and guilt at doing something I thought – no, I knew – was perverted and abnormal. I was clearly sick in the head.Back in the 60s and 70s transvestism was on a very long alphabetical list of sexual deviations. There were certainly no role models for a teenage boy obsessed with dressing as a girl. The only cross-dressers I ever saw were men playing women for laughs in films or on television – female impersonators such as Danny La Rue, comedians in the Carry On films or Monty Python’s Flying Circus. I was convinced that, dressed as a woman, I must look utterly ridiculous. A joke.Then, in 1981, something amazing happened. I moved to London and one day in a remainder bookshop found a copy of Dressing Up, Peter Ackroyd’s 1979 history of transvestism and drag. I learned that, for centuries, in almost every country in the world, men and women had worn each other’s clothes. I also saw Richard O’Brien’s Rocky Horror Picture Show – a glorious celebration of dressing up in women’s lingerie. It seemed I wasn’t quite as weird and alone as I’d thought.By the mid-80s my artwork was being published in newspapers and magazines and I couldn’t resist slipping my secret dressing-up obsession into my comic strips – disguised, of course. I peopled my cartoons with humans who feel compelled to dress as plants or fish aliens who camouflage themselves as coat hangers dissatisfied items of furniture – chairs, for example – who yearn to be tables. In my drawings, as in the real world, things weren’t always quite what they seemed.When the internet arrived in the 90s, one idle evening it occurred to me to type the word “transvestite” into an early search engine – and everything changed. Hundreds and thousands of pages of hits came down the wires and filled my computer screen. Millions of men, just like me, were wearing women’s clothes behind closed curtains and locked doors. I was not alone, I was one of many. If I was a pervert, then I was in the company of countless numbers of other perverts.Slowly, I started seeing cross-dressing as a positive, magical thing rather than a curse. In my arty way I began thinking of myself as transforming from a man into an exotic, mythical creature, like a faun, perhaps, except I was part boy and part girl, rather than part boy and part goat. In my head, putting on the clothes of the opposite sex gradually shifted from a sickness to feeling more like a delightfully naughty blessing. Dressing up was a way of stepping through a wardrobe from one world into another. It was liberating – and fun!I soon discovered there were clubs and events I could go to, from huge, all night dress-up parties where everyone with every possible kind of kink was welcome, such as Torture Garden, to more specifically trans-orientated clubs, like the WayOut – the first trans nightclub I ever went to.I remember my first visit vividly. The hours spent carefully applying makeup and trying on outfits the waiting until it got dark before daring to slip out of the house in case one of the neighbours saw me driving to the address convinced that everyone in the other cars could spot that I was a man sitting in the parked car until the street was deserted before opening the door and tottering, in unfamiliar shoes and skirt, to the club entrance. It was utterly terrifying and completely exhilarating at the same time.Transvestites began making appearances in my books and comic strips. A female version of myself featured in an episode of my BBC Radio 4 series, Steven Appleby’s Normal Life, and a musical play based on my work was titled Crocs in Frocks.Finally, I decided I’d had enough of leading a double life. My wife and siblings knew I cross-dressed – I’d come out to them in the late-90s, which had been terrifying because… what if they’d rejected me? Luckily they all accepted it as a part of my artistic temperament, I think. But, even so, I was finding that only being able to dress up once a week or so was stifling. I’d learned to be comfortable with being a transvestite and now I was desperate to be honest and open and live as one. Also, I had young children and wanted them to grow up knowing their father as a complete person, not someone with a huge secret that would – inevitably – come out… What effect might that have had on our relationship?I took to wearing increasingly androgynous clothes, jewellery, nail varnish and a little subtle makeup – being careful not to embarrass my boys at school parents’ evenings – and began opening up about my transvestism to friends and employers.Thankfully, I never had a bad response. And then one day 12 years ago, I went out with my wife and two of our closest female friends on a shopping expedition to select a wig. Trying on a dozen different styles in the wig shop was great fun, but nothing looked quite right until I put on perhaps the 10th or 11th and everyone said unanimously: “That’s the one!” I left the shop wearing new hair – and stepped into a new, trans life.Back home, I stuck my head through the door into the sitting room and the boys barely looked up from watching TV. They didn’t seem to notice my change. I asked them about it recently and they said: “Dad, you were always just you.”For many years now I haven’t owned a single item of male clothing. I’m trying to be me, so I am comfortable looking feminine, but continuing to be called Steven. Surely there don’t need to be any rules? And the boys – now young men – still call me Dad. Because, of course, however I have chosen to look, I’ll always be their dad.Dragman by Steven Appleby is published by Jonathan Cape at £18.99.

And yet its patterns have become wearyingly predictable for those in the US and the UK, which seem bound together not just by a “special relationship” but by a worrying inadequacy in government response.In the face of rising public fear and frustration, even the loyalist press on both sides of the Atlantic are toppling like treacherous dominos, pushed over by the not-so-slight touch of facts and existential threat.The bodies piling up in the makeshift morgues, the families and friends in hospital or worse, the sirens that sound all day and all night, are pieces of physical evidence ignored by only the most debased Twitter conspiracy theorist.  It was startling to see the Daily , the house journal of the Boris Johnson government, deliver the banner headline “Questions without answers” last week as the government fumbled to give any clear responses on the lack of testing and the projections for lockdown.“This testing shambles is unforgivable: when will ministers act?” asked the Daily Mail. Telling the public what they want to hear is suddenly out of fashion in partisan journalism. Instead, they are telling them what they need to hear. In public health, communication is everything. Policy and behavioural change is the target with Covid-19 and government accountability is the key.In the US, the unthinkable happened as Fox News, which rallied behind Donald Trump in the earliest days of his coronavirus denial, sharply changed its tune. It fired Trish Regan, a host on Fox Business, after a histrionic opening monologue to her show where she blamed “liberal media” for spreading “mass hysteria” and using the coronavirus as a tool for impeachment.Sean Hannity, the most high profile and Trump-aligned Fox personality, dropped the “Coronavirus hysteria” graphic from 9 March and replaced it with a more sombre “Facts over fear” tone a week later. It might be too late. A survey from the Pew Research Center’s Journalism and Media Project last week showed a stark ision in beliefs about the spread of the virus, according to which cable outlet viewers watched.In a world where facts have been treated as optional, particularly by Fox News’s main channel, the need for a shared belief in evidence-based coverage has now become a matter of life and death. An open letter from journalists and academics was sent to Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch, and his son and Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch, detailing the ways in which the deliberate spread of misinformation on the channel was endangering lives: “Inexcusably, Fox News has violated elementary canons of journalism. In so doing, it has contributed to the spread of a grave pandemic.”Some of the more comfortable practices of government press relations, on both sides of the Atlantic, have also been put under the microscope. In the UK, the briefing of lobby correspondents on complex health issues is clearly not working. While it is important to know how the government is thinking and forming its strategy, it is also important that subject experts can ask the harder follow-up questions. Off-the-record briefings to favoured journalists, particularly those with a large broadcast presence, have long been standard practice. But there is something shockingly irresponsible about ideas such as the disastrous “herd immunity” strategy being laundered through a journalist, even one as well respected as ITV’s Robert Peston.Those with long memories will remember what a tour de force Peston was as a BBC journalist, breaking story after story on the financial collapse in 2008. As a highly skilled and experienced financial journalist, he was in the perfect position to understand and interrogate the information.Ten days ago, the US press was debating why it sends political journalists to the White House daily press briefings, rather than health correspondents. Now a number of high-profile outlets, including the Washington Post and the New York Times, are simply not sending correspondents to the briefings at all, as editors judge the news-free pantomime of a miniature Trump rally not worth the risk to reporters’ health.Cable and broadcast networks no longer, as a matter of course, carry the full two-hour rambling promotions. On a good day the medical expertise of Dr Anthony Fauci or Dr Deborah Birx comes to the fore, obscuring the boastful rambling of the president. On a bad day, you might get the Trump cheerleader and chief executive of MyPillow, Michael J Lindell, or Jared Kushner, the president’s ineffectual son-in-law.Not everything is worse than expected. If you had told New Yorkers, before the wave of a deadly pandemic broke over them, that the national hero of the catastrophe would be their governor, Andrew Cuomo, and his somewhat notorious powerpoint presentations, few would have believed it. Cuomo’s peacetime reputation as a political blunt instrument, whose policies have neither addressed inequality or fixed the subway, has been blown away by a wartime leader of gravity and directness, warmth and steel.Cuomo is Churchillian, in that his decidedly poor record on many peacetime political matters has been largely erased by getting the wartime calls right. Cuomo’s daily walk through the unvarnished numbers of New York City deaths, hospitalisations, availability of beds and ventilators, the expansion of emergency facilities, is nationally required viewing. The clarity of now, is reassuring in the grip of future uncertainty.Reliable clear information, presented in a clear understandable way, peppered with human empathy, goes a long way to papering over the yawning chasms of unpreparedness.We are by now used to thinking ahead about what might change after the pandemic is tamed. For politicians and the media, the change ought to be that we replace the current pantomime of government press relations with a more serious piece of policy theatre, or even a dose of reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ee1c2bc0787f87636cf193387dab43124022f02/87_250_5965_3582/master/5965.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=559bb5c656298f728662c42316d4d088","title":"from houseparty to zoom our digital lives in lockdown","story":"The lockdown across the world has led people to desperately seek out new tools for maintaining their work and social lives online.

Thomas-Symonds, the MP for the Welsh seat of Torfaen since 2015, was previously a security minister in the shadow home affairs team.Dodds, the Oxford East MP, is a former MEP and has spent nearly three years as a shadow Treasury minister.Among the other appointments, Angela Rayner, the newly elected deputy leader, was also made the Labour party chair.There was a return to the shadow cabinet for Rachel Reeves, the Leeds West MP who was shadow work and pensions minister under Ed Miliband but who spent the entire Corbyn period on the backbenches. She was made shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.Jonathan Ashworth remains in the health brief, as was widely expected given the coronavirus pandemic, with Nick Brown staying as chief whip and Angela Smith as shadow Lords leader.Emily Thornberry, previously shadow foreign secretary, will stay in the shadow cabinet in a new position to be announced on Monday.Nandy’s elevation was the one surprise amid the most senior appointments, with a series of newspapers having tipped the Cardiff MP Jo Stevens as being lined up for the post.While Nandy, the MP for Wigan since 2010, came a third in the leadership race, she emerged during the campaign as a leading voice in promoting Labour efforts to reconnect with voters in struggling towns in the north and Midlands.Nandy’s mantra during the campaign was that Labour must “change or die”. On foreign affairs she was critical of what she said was the disinclination of Corbyn and his team to criticise Russia, and she called for a more positive defence of international values.In a tweet following the news, Nandy wrote: “It’s a real honour to be tasked with leading Labour’s foreign policy response in these difficult times.”Starmer said that under his leadership the priority would be to “act in the country’s interest to save lives and protect livelihoods” during the coronavirus pandemic.“We will be a responsible opposition that supports the government where we believe they are right and challenge them when we believe mistakes are being made,” he said.Asked about his plans earlier in the day, Starmer told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show that his shadow cabinet would be “balanced across the party, it will be balanced across the country – and of course it will be balanced in terms of ersity”.Asked if he would include some Blairites in his frontbench team, Starmer said he wanted to move on from such labels.“I will have in my shadow cabinet those that want to serve towards the future aim of winning that next general election. It’ll be a talented, balanced shadow cabinet,” he said. “We’re not looking back, we’re not badging people by the past. We’re going forward to the future, focusing on how we win the 2024 general election.”In his first media interview since winning the leadership, Starmer sought to stress party unity but made it plain he believed that Labour needed significant change. “We just lost four elections in a row and therefore of course we need to change. If we don’t change we will lose the next general election.”Playing down the idea of some form of national unity government, Starmer pledged to work constructively with the government over the response to coronavirus while asking “difficult questions” when needed.But he stressed the need for an equitable economic settlement once the crisis was over, saying there would be a need for richer people and corporations to pay more tax, rather than a return to austerity.“What we can’t do is go back to business as usual,” he said. “We now know who the key workers really are, and they very often have been overlooked and underpaid, and there has got to be a change. They were last and now they’ve got to be first.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7c63fb2a9943e96600dfac03eaa967dd1f0f6fd/0_1252_3460_2076/master/3460..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a794d5da42d86512bc4a48c93669633b","title":"kapil dev tavare and me bollywood brings india 1983 world cup film","story":"The unexpected World Cup final win against West Indies is celebrated in a new blockbuster. ’s Toby Chasseaud did his best to play his partAt the end of the season, just as I’m packing my kit away for the winter, I see an advert circulating on social media: “Skilled cricket players needed. Casting feature film based on 1983 cricket World Cup. Players to represent West Indies, England, Australia and Zimbabwe teams.” Perhaps I shouldn’t hide away my whites just yet, I think.I send the talent agency a headshot and a brief summary of my playing ability, and a week later I’m asked to Lord’s to audition for the part of Chris Tavaré. To prepare I’m asked to “have a look at some online footage of how he bowls, bats, catches, celebrates, etc, so you have an idea of his personality traits and style”.In one of the first YouTube videos to appear when I type Chris Tavaré the Kent captain is interviewed alongside his opposite number, Botham, at Lord’s after Somerset have just won the 1983 NatWest final, which followed the World Cup. He says getting “Tav” out for 39 off 80 balls was a big moment as it opened up an end for Somerset to bowl at. Tavaré is gracious in defeat. and Observer’s own Vic Marks was the player of the match in that final, taking three for 30 from 10 overs, including that of his friend Tavaré. I ask Marks for advice before my audition. “Chris spoke slowly and deliberately in a deepish voice – and not that often, which led briefly to the predictable nickname of Rowdy in early England dressing rooms,” Marks says. “But he had a neat sense of humour and a tendency toward self-deprecation. I always felt he was a much better player than he thought. He was very popular. Botham and Bob Willis liked him a lot – as did everyone else, especially his contrasting opening partner in 1983, Graeme Fowler.”Tavaré would make 58 (off 116 balls) in a 115 partnership with Fowler in a seven-wicket victory against Pakistan at Old Trafford in the World Cup. “Chris had the neatest of cricket coffins and upon dismissal he would carefully return his kit there. From his demeanour it would be hard to tell whether he had made nought or a hundred,” Marks says. “He was a cautious man in several ways – he travelled to India with his own pillow (often coveted by others in some of the hotels) and pyjamas and later on he took to wearing a gumshield when batting, which meant his calling when running between the wickets produced a muffled, barely comprehensible sound, which often meant ‘Come on then’.“We all know Chris’s reputation but I can promise you he played some of the most destructive innings in one-day cricket, especially at county level for Kent and then Somerset and the odd one for England. In this format he stood tall and occasionally wandered down the wicket before the ball was bowled. So it wasn’t such a daft idea to have him in the World Cup squad.”Another YouTube video shows highlights of Fowler and Tavaré sharing an opening stand of 69 against India in the semi-final at Old Trafford. Tavaré’s stance is very side-on. He clips the ball through midwicket for an all-run four. He later plays an almost identical shot off the bowling of Kapil Dev, which this time crosses the boundary. This is followed by a cut for four through point. He plays and misses outside off stump to Roger Binny before edging behind to be caught by Syed Kirmani for 32.When I turn up at the Indoor Cricket Centre at Lord’s in November 2018 I find I’m in a group of six players all auditioning for parts, though I’m the only Tavaré. One chap has to fill the big boots of Botham. Another is auditioning to be the Australian Trevor Chappell and says he has struggled to find much footage of him other than the notorious under-arm bowling incident of 1981.When I’m asked to speak to camera in the nerves of the moment I forget to talk like Tavaré. Then I’m asked to bowl my left-arm spin, which I don’t think will help my chances of being cast as Tavaré because a) he wasn’t left-handed and b) he didn’t bowl in the World Cup. Still, I’m asked to deliver a ball and sledge the nonexistent batsman – not necessarily Tavaré-like behaviour, I think. But then other roles are up for grabs. I’m asked to bowl another ball, appeal loudly and celebrate. Because the ball I bowl has hit neither a pad nor an edge, I forget to appeal straight away, which is embarrassing.Next it’s time to bat. The bowling machine spits a ball at me and I try to drive but manage only to squirt away a bottom edge. The following three deliveries produce a similar result, though, in my defence, I haven’t faced a bowling machine for more than 10 years. I have more success against four back-of-a-length balls, punching them into the off side off the back foot. Then I face four short balls. We’re supposed to pull them but I make poor contact and the ball goes behind square.The second and third balls produce similar, unspectacular, results. The last ball I am supposed to strike and then celebrate as if I’ve hit the winning runs but I spoon it and when attempting to celebrate struggle to take my helmet off as the strap stays wedged beneath my chin. So, all in all, it’s not been the most convincing of auditions. No surprise, then, I never hear back from them.“The Indian team had already been cast a long time back but in the UK we were looking for players to represent England, Australia, Zimbabwe and West Indies,” the film’s UK line producer, Cyrus Patel, tells me later. “We wanted the action to be authentic.” The cast is made up of actors in the main roles with body doubles for the cricketing action. It took eight months to find the West Indies side as the search for them was extended from the UK to the Caribbean. The great fast bowler Malcolm Marshall is played by his son, Mali.“The calibre of cricketers cast was extremely high. They’re all accomplished players because we wanted the action to be as close to international standard as possible,” Patel says. He tells me Tavaré’s part was taken by Phil Lowe, a cricketer from Loughborough who plays for Newtown Linford in Division One of the Leicestershire and Rutland League.When I track down Lowe, he describes what it was like to be involved in the film. “I had to go to London for training and a wardrobe fitting. We spent a couple of hours in the nets at Lord’s replicating footage from the semi-final between England and India. There were certain shots Tavaré played that I would have to replicate and I needed to perfect his technique before filming started.“I was told I needed to grow a moustache and let my hair grow as long as possible. I’d never grown a moustache before but luckily by the time filming had come around I’d managed a reasonable one. But I had to wear a wig because there was insufficient time to grow the back and sides long enough, which wasn’t ideal during long, hot days of filming in the summer.”It was at the Nevill Ground Kapil scored 175 not out after India were initially reduced to nine for four by Zimbabwe. No original footage exists of this record-breaking innings because BBC cameramen were on strike. But Patel says they tried to recreate it as accurately as they could.“Apart from the Nevill Ground all the other venues have changed considerably since 1983 so we made extensive use of CGI to take the viewer back in time,” he says. “But Lord’s couldn’t have been more welcoming to us and over four days in August 2019 we were able to film in the dressing rooms and in the Long Room.” Some of the street and hotel scenes were shot in Glasgow which, in Patel’s words, “has the feel of 1980s London”.Going into the tournament India’s previous World Cup record was dismal. In 1979 they had failed to win a game and in 1975 had won one, against East Africa. West Indies, on the other hand, had never lost a World Cup match, winning the tournament in 1975 and 1979. “It seemed like only Kapil believed India could win it,” Patel says.In the final, India were bowled out for 183 in 54.4 overs and West Indies had the champagne on ice. But Clive Lloyd’s team were then skittled for 140 in 52 overs. They were later to find Kapil knocking on their dressing-room door and asking for some bottles of fizz as the Indian camp had not anticipated victory.Kapil finished the tournament with 303 runs in eight innings at an average of 60.60 and a strike rate of 108.99. He took 12 wickets at an average of 20.41 and a miserly economy rate of 2.91, and caught Viv Richards and Clive Lloyd in the final – the first spectacularly so.“Never did India think they would get to the final, let alone win it,” Patel says. “The 1983 World Cup final was a match that transformed a nation. It is one of those perfect underdog sport stories.”The film, simply to be called ’83, had been scheduled for release on 10 April before the coronavirus pandemic intervened. And now Patel is unsure whether footage of Lowe batting will make the final cut of India’s success story. Tavaré was there but it was Kapil and his men who stole the show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9093708160560c1a3e8507f078d17fa74ecc8ab/0_102_1817_1090/master/1817..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4df474173a556d0656f21660642b597","title":"shane lowry open champion interview golf","story":"Last year’s Open champion reflects on breaking his duck at Royal Portrush, the pressure of being an Irish golfer and what it was like growing up in the shadow of Rory McIlroyShane Lowry has always been blessed with a candour that makes his depiction of trying to cross the line at an Open Championship no surprise. “It’s not a nice place to be,” he says. “It’s where you want to be as a golfer, I hope I’m in that situation again, but anyone telling you to go out and enjoy yourself? They are mad or don’t know what they are talking about. It’s the most unenjoyable weekend of your life. You realise the magnitude of the whole thing.”As uncertainty surrounds the next and 149th playing of the Open, Lowry’s runaway success at Royal Portrush last July is worthy of further reflection. The wave of support and emotion as the man from County Offaly marched down the 72nd fairway emphasised what this meant to Northern Ireland and Irish golf. It was monumental for Lowry too, a maiden major triumph four years after he conceded a four-stroke lead after 54 holes in the US Open at Oakmont.“Oakmont took longer than I realised, my form went really bad after what had been a good 12-18 months. I will probably always look back and think I should have won … but everyone has one of those.”Lowry was to have the last laugh, including on the United States Golf Association executive who thought it smart to draw him as part of a “heavyweight” three ball – Kevin Stadler and Brendon de Jonge the others – at an earlier US Open. “I remember I wasn’t too happy about it at all,” says Lowry. “Whoever came up with that idea, it wasn’t a very nice thing to do.”Lowry can dismiss that incident. When golf resumes, it will be fascinating to see if he can become a multiple major champion. On talent grounds, there is no reason why not. “I’m not happy to live off the Open,” he says. “I’d love to win more. I feel very lucky and privileged to have done what I did, in that manner and where I did it. Genuinely, if it all ended today it would be decent but I’m a very driven and competitive person. I want to keep pushing on.”Lowry’s endearing post-Open celebrations, in Dublin bars and in front of 15,000 people at a homecoming in Clara, became the stuff of legend. “I knew it would be a big deal but when you are living it, it’s incredible,” he recalls. “We are a great country when our sportspeople are doing well. Now, we have no problem kicking sportspeople when they are down as well.“I used to curse the other Irish lads. All that people in Ireland asked me was: ‘When are you going to win a major?’ They don’t think you’ve made it unless you win a major.”Lowry’s smile masks a serious point about not allowing the winning of the Claret Jug to go to his head. “If I was to arrive in my hometown in a flash car, I’d be dragged back down to earth fairly quickly.”In early 2020 Lowry appeared to be toiling with the expectation of being the Open champion, and afforded a bunker some unwanted excavation work when about to miss the cut in Abu Dhabi. Lowry has always set himself high standards had his mindset been adversely affected by Portrush?“Abu Dhabi was very difficult to take,” he says. “I was defending champion in a Rolex Series event and I knew I wasn’t going to play on the European Tour for a while. Before I knew it I had missed the cut and I was taken aback by it. I was hard on myself, I’d be pissed off sitting in the locker room changing my shoes but by the time I’m back at the hotel I’m fine.“The one thing I struggled with is that everywhere I went people expected me to have the burden of being Open champion. In my head I was like: ‘Why is this a burden? This is the greatest thing to happen in my career.’ I’ve not set the world alight since I won but you can get very result-orientated when you do something big. ‘Oh my God, I need to perform to the best of my ability every week.’“I am mature enough to know golf isn’t like that. Golf is a funny game, we are not all Rory McIlroy where we top-five every week. I’ve put pressure on myself for the majority of my career anyway and if anything, I’d put too much on. I don’t feel anything extra now.”Golf’s indefinite shutdown means Lowry may well set a non-wartime record as the reigning Open champion. Yet this break will cause inevitable frustration Lowry has dreams of a Ryder Cup debut at Whistling Straits this year when another of Ireland’s famous sons, Padraig Harrington, will lead Europe’s team. “I’ve never done it so it wouldn’t matter who was captain but it would be extra special with Padraig,” he says. “I want to make the team and think I would be good in that environment. And it’s not just making the team I want to help win the Ryder Cup.”Now 33, Lowry has spent a golfing lifetime in the company of McIlroy. The pair were amateur teammates long before majors were conquered. Lowry scoffs at the notion of one as talented as the world No 1 being a source of jealousy. “I’m open about the fact he is the best player in the world,” he says. “When he has his A-game, I’ve said it for years, there’s nobody better.“He was always the superstar. When you get to hang around and play with the best, you learn a lot. They almost drag you towards – not to – their level. When I was playing amateur golf there were big crowds because Rory was playing. Things like that really helped me.“I’m a very ambitious golfer but I’m not stupid. I know I’m not going to win eight or 10 majors like Rory wants to win. I’m probably never going to be world No 1. But I am going to go out every day and give it the best I can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39c510d50227249488bfe3b804fd0c732d43c17d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d9697bf85fcdc8d9a01396b869a633b","title":"the breadwinners of barishal how women in bangladesh are starting their own businesses","story":"Women in this flood-hit area are supporting their families through small businesses backed by the British Red Cross. From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/353a242eb736dab1df645bb2837a4b6ba7f0dd2b/0_410_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c81f4e54fe523fa7891843b3184397bf","title":"lockdown learning how to dance tango classes online youtube","story":"Our writer tries to recreate the buzz of a Buenos Aires dancehall in his UK living room with a selection of tango classes on YouTube All of Argentina’s 44 million inhabitants currently appear to be offering online tango classes.

Jonatan and Julia speak pretty good English and their opening 10-minute class concentrated on posture. I hope they add more classes this week. James and Joanna are apparently in England, but who cares? They are very good on the first few key moves. Sebastián and Mariana are the real thing, and can show the more confident a few tricks.Most online classes are delivered by couples, though a few dancers do work alone, if you want to indulge the fantasy of a long-distance tango partner. Songs typically last three minutes – though one dancer titled her book Twelve Minutes of Love to reflect the fact that tangueros generally do tandas (turns) of four songs – so expect three minutes of giggling as your lower limbs get tied in knots and your high kick hits the telly.Once you have a few basic moves and feel a sense of tango rhythm, tune in to La 2 x 4 , a 24-hour online tango radio station funded by Buenos Aires city hall. When I tuned in they were playing crooner numbers driven by pounding button accordion.Your living room may not have the atmosphere of an Argentine milonga, but uncork a decent malbec, dim the lights, put on something by Julio de Caro or Juan Carlos Cobián and you’ll be transported far away from the world of Covid-19 for three minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3b78f8faecfa509c17c1f61ab0464d39bdb49a/0_239_5030_3020/master/5030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8b7aecb09fb1e4af3ee91a1ef68d5c6","title":"send tip favourite travel souvenir win 200 pounds sawdays stay","story":"Tell us about something you picked up on your travels that brings back great memories or takes you back in timeGiven that we’re all stuck at home for who knows how long, our travel memories are especially poignant.

The search was suspended on Saturday night, a Maryland natural resources police news release said.The missing canoeists were identified as Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean, 40, and McKean’s eight-year-old son, Gideon Joseph Kennedy McKean.“With profound sadness, I share the news that the search for my beloved daughter Maeve and grandson Gideon has turned from rescue to recovery,” Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in a statement on Friday night.Kennedy Townsend, who served two terms as Maryland’s lieutenant governor, is the eldest daughter of the US attorney general and New York senator Robert F Kennedy, who was shot dead in 1968, and niece of John F Kennedy, the 35th president who was assassinated in 1963.On Saturday, vessels conducted sonar operations around the area where the two were last seen and where their overturned canoe was recovered, according to police. The mother and son may have been paddling the canoe from a home in Shady Side, Maryland, to retrieve a ball and could not paddle back to shore, police said earlier.Maeve McKean, a public health and human rights lawyer, was executive director of the Georgetown University Global Health Initiative. She graduated from Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service and law school.“Maeve was a master connector who brought together faculty and students across disciplines and schools in order to advance our shared mission for improving health and advancing justice, particularly for those left out or left behind,” John Monahan, an adviser to Georgetown’s president, said in a news release.Monahan said the university community was “heartsick” about what happened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8de8c272a9be04a319822ab10592c12352b2320/0_142_4000_2400/master/4000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f341dca31f6df90e334f1a6de54fd98b","title":"sunak emergency covid 19 loan what do companies think","story":"The chancellor’s original scheme worried employers. So how has the revamped plan gone down?Newmarket HolidaysMarc Vincent, finance director of Newmarket Holidays, says the firm sells 80,000 holidays a year and around a third are sold online. Now he is deluged by customer inquiries. That has meant he cannot furlough staff: it’s all hands to the pumps.“If tour operators are allowed to go under, it will be like a run on a bank, with a long chain of suppliers also affected,” he said. “And then the government will need to bail out customers anyway, so much better to do it now.”To benefit from a VAT holiday until the summer, staff have spent the last week delving through payments, though he says the savings are limited.Regulations that give customers the right to demand their money back on package holidays within 14 days of cancellation should be changed, he says. Instead, travel firms should be allowed to offer credit notes that can be redeemed after two years if they are not spent. “Other EU countries are doing this and so should we.”Chairman and chief executive Antony Sheriff was disappointed with Sunak’s first effort at a loan scheme for medium-sized companies like his when it insisted they must access commercial loans – a costly and cumbersome procedure. The reforms mean the company will now examine them favourably. “I think he has done a good job,” says Sheriff.The 55-year-old company has cash in the bank and could withstand several months of a lockdown, he says, but he is concerned about the costs of starting up again in the summer or autumn, which could mean outlays for materials would be prohibitively expensive.“We make everything on our boats, from the hull to the furniture. It all happens here. We account for about 15,000 jobs in the Plymouth area and the ease of getting back into production is key,” he says.Any thought of profits this year have evaporated. “Everybody will look back at 2020 and say what a shame, but I hope not too many people will focus on the financials in a year that is pretty much a write-off,” he says. Newcastle UniversityThere are officials inside the Treasury who consider universities the linchpin and economic driving force of many towns and cities in Britain. Huge employers, they are also tied into the local economy through relationships with businesses and state agencies, including the NHS.Some staff on fixed-term contracts have had their status paused, he says, while the university looks to place them in other roles. But his main concern is bridging the likely two-to-three-year gap before foreign student numbers return to current levels. “We don’t have the resources to keep research going with financial help from our funders. We don’t get the full economic cost of research paid for other than by cross-subsidy from foreign student income. It has always been an unstable situation that the pandemic forces us to address,” he says. Fred Olsen“I have been talking to our management team about government funding and how the travel industry has reacted passively while airline businesses like Virgin Atlantic have said a subsidy is desperately needed,” says Peter Deer, managing director of Fred Olsen Cruise Lines.Virgin has called on the government to give the industry up to £7.5bn in state support. The chancellor rebuffed the call, saying he would only consider support on a case-by-case basis. Despite this setback, Deer thinks the travel industry should be making more noise.The company, which has a turnover of £200m-£250m, has four ships laying up in the Firth of Forth and a fifth, the Braemar, about to leave Southampton to join them. About 300 of the firm’s 500 staff in Ipswich are home-working while they deal with customer inquiries, many of them about lost bookings. The rest are at home not working.“We are using the furlough scheme, and that is great, but there are many other costs we face,” he says, adding that the government should be working harder to prevent the industry shrinking.“The drop in cruise-ship business has come as a huge shock to our suppliers, the majority of which are in the UK. There are 40,000 people in the industry and they are being completely overlooked.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdb1bee12f06216f2cee1800ad45fd47effbf02c/0_139_4416_2649/master/4416..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5bf2b53e12686f202e6d2cf9ed11821","title":"coronavirus churches florida social distancing","story":"Concerted effort to protect religious freedoms is playing out as some states exempt houses of worship from stay-home ordersWhen a Florida pastor, who had been arrested for holding a church service despite local coronavirus restrictions, complained he was the victim of “a tyrannical government”, Ron DeSantis, the state’s Republican governor, was listening.In executive orders issued in quick succession this week, DeSantis designated religious services as “essential activities”. Then he swept away the right of cities and counties to ban them.“I don’t think the government has the authority to close a church. I’m certainly not going to do that,” DeSantis said. “In Easter season, people are going to want to have access to religious services.”This, however, was no municipality-versus-state power struggle. A concerted effort to protect religious freedoms is playing out across the country in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, frustrating efforts by public health officials to enforce social distancing per federal guidelines and slow the spread of the deadly virus.In almost all of the states that lead the nation in numbers of cases, and which have issued blanket stay-at-home orders, there are specific exemptions for religious gatherings or acts of worship, a survey by the  of published regulations and media coverage found.In others with definitive lists of non-essential businesses or activities ordered to close, churches, synagogues, mosques, temples and other houses of faith are not among them.What isn’t clear is how many people are still attending services, or how many are taking place. Leaders of many of the largest religions by followers in the US, including Mormonism, Catholicism, Islam and various denominations of Judaism, have closed houses of worship and are urging services take place online.“This decision comes out of sacrificial love, not from habitual or casual disregard for worship,” the leaders of Christianity Today and the National Association of Evangelicals said in a joint statement.“We will not be passing the peace with hugs, but rather with texts and phone calls. Are these modes inferior? Yes. Will they be acceptable to the Lord? We also believe, yes.”An open letter to Catholic bishops calling for public mass and access to the holy sacraments is gaining traction online, pushed by a newly-formed group of theologians and ministers calling itself the Easter People.“Something is terribly wrong with a culture that allows abortion clinics and liquor stores to remain open but shuts down places of worship,” the group said.Other than Texas and Florida, states that have issued exemptions for religious events and with large numbers of coronavirus cases or significant populations of older people include Delaware, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Tennessee and West Virginia. The homepage for executive orders signed by the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, includes the words: “A place of religious worship is not subject to penalty.”The Center for American Progress, a progressive public policy research group, published its own study of states it found to have enacted exemptions to stay-at-home orders on religious grounds, describing it as “an alarming trend”.According to the group, Pennsylvania was the first to move, on 19 March when it enacted a clause that exempts the “operations of religious institutions” from its closure order on physical premises of “non-life sustaining businesses”.Over the next five days, five more states – New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Louisiana, Ohio, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, West Virginia and Kansas – acted by including religious exemptions to varying degrees. For example, New Mexico banned gatherings of more than five people anywhere, with “churches, synagogues, mosques and other places of worship” among the exceptions. West Virginia’s order, meanwhile, adds specific wording to assure citizens that travel to and from a place of worship would also not be considered a violation.The fact that religious groups can still hold gatherings in so many states does not mean all of them will do so. But there are prominent exceptions, such as the Florida pastor Rodney Howard-Browne, who has now decided to shutter his River at Tampa Bay church for this weekend’s Palm Sunday services anyway, and the Life Tabernacle church in Louisiana. Dozens of cases of coronavirus have been reported at a California megachurch.“The ability to gather as people of faith is our first freedom. But as with other freedoms now cabined in the name of public safety, religious freedom must take a backseat, at least for now,” is the view of an editorial by three Canopy analysts, Robin Fretwell Wilson, Brian Smith and Tanner Bean.“Now is not the time to stand on our rights. It is not the time to pursue contentious religious freedom claims in the courthouse. Instead, it is a time to lead by example, as so many congregations and people of faith have done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 5 april","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday include:The country registered 525 new coronavirus deaths on Sunday, the lowest daily rate in the last two weeks.

The number is expected to increase to “hundreds of thousands being delivered every week” according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, but action has been much quicker on the ground. We speak to some of the heroes in the drive to keep the nation fed.SloughIn a little under three weeks, Ajmal Azam has helped support about 300 people in his local community by organising a network of food parcels, shopping and hot meals for those most in need. In another life, 36-year-old Azam is a full-time barrister practising in family law, a married father of two and a school governor. Now he spends six hours a day packing and delivering boxes of tinned goods, pulses, bread, fruit and veg. It’s humbling, he admits, but crucial work.Azam drew up a roster of volunteers, and has been working alongside Sikhs in Slough, who are also operating a mobile food-support network for those who are over 65 and quarantined. “We called up Wexham, our local hospital, to ask what they needed, and a senior A\u0026ampE sister pointed out that a number of nurses are in self-isolation and struggling to get basic necessities – so we put together 100 packages that day.”While Azam has spent “probably more than £1,000” getting supplies together, he is keen to credit local grocers, supermarkets and takeaways that have been providing food and essentials. “Everyone wants to help. That’s incredible. My phone hasn’t stopped ringing since we put the first flyer out on social media. I do feel drained and exhausted at this stage but the impact we’ve had is so endearing. I’ve had so many messages from people that it’s making a difference to. That’s keeping me going.”LondonChef Michey Chan is used to cooking up a storm. In his day job, heading up the staff kitchen at the Dorchester, he prepares an average of 900 meals for the lunch and dinner service. At Manorfield primary school in east London, where he is now feeding the children of key workers and teaching staff, the brief is a touch less intense but arguably a lot more satisfying.“The kids have really good palates,” says Chan. “They don’t have bad eating habits and they’re adventurous about trying a lot of things. Sometimes we have to bribe them with cookies but they try everything.”It has been two weeks since the Dorchester team took up residency in the school canteen, in an area that headteacher Paul Jackson describes as “incredibly deprived”. Over half the school is entitled to free school meals, and 72 pupils are on the child protection register. At the moment, anywhere between 12 and 20 children are coming in every day, with Manorfield operating as a hub for neighbouring schools.With help from the Dorchester and the local authority, Jackson is now working on a scheme to get hot meals and food parcels delivered to vulnerable local families throughout the Easter holidays: “It’s a way for us to feel useful – you don’t notice the stress of everything until you’re out of here. One thing is certain: even when things change, school meals here will never be the same again. The standards have been changed for ever.”GlasgowIt began, as lockdown ideas now often do, over Whatsapp. Disheartened by the gloom shrouding Glasgow, jewellery maker Freya Alder got chatting to her friends – illustrator Isabella Burnell and textile designer Ruth Mitchell – about ways to lift the collective mood. The three launched the Maker’s Raffle two weeks ago with pieces donated by a dozen Scottish ceramicists, potters, textile designers and printmakers, hoping to match the £1,500 Alder had raised in December for Glasgow South East Foodbank.“After the general election, I felt a huge sense of doom and powerlessness. Going to the Co-op the morning after and putting some stuff in the food bank made me feel infinitely better, which is where the idea was born,” says Alder. The response this time round, however, has floored her.“I did a little callout but people have been amazing. Our businesses are small and they’ve been hit hard but we know other vulnerable people are struggling.”Despite a significant loss of income for many of the one-person businesses trying to weather the current crisis, Alder reports that “it’s made us all feel better, I think that’s why it’s been so successful. Makers are uncomfortable trying to sell their wares when they know people are stretched thin, but this is a tiny little gesture anyone can join in.”Tickets are £2. Alder’s hope is that communities in other cities will copy the model to support food banks, which are desperate for donations nationwide. “Every city has a creative scene, and if every city did one of these it could make so much money for people who need it most,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5054e260393fd42808acb4d46377bc3d8da204b/81_116_3419_2053/master/3419..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0213aae07840dd04ecb79ab2e8786a7e","title":"lombardy insists on face masks outside homes to stop covid 19","story":"Officials look to make U-turn on covering nose and mouth despite equipment shortagesAuthorities in Lombardy, the Italian region worst affected by coronavirus, have introduced a law obliging citizens to wear face masks when they go outside, while Spain is considering recommending the public wear masks.As the number of confirmed infections globally passed the 1.2m mark officials around the world appeared to be making a U-turn on whether the public should wear masks, despite huge shortages.The calls came as a senior US health official braced the country for a coming week of deaths that would rival “911 or Pearl Harbor” in their impact on the nation’s psyche.US surgeon general Jerome Adams warned: “This is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans lives, quite frankly.“This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 911 moment, only it’s not going to be localised … It’s going to be happening all over the country. And I want America to understand that.”Italy also saw a significant decline in both deaths and the rate of increase of new cases on Sunday. The 525 new coronavirus deaths announced were the lowest in the last two weeks, and well down from the record high of 969 on 27 March.Previously, countries had followed international health recommendations that suggested masks offered little protection and if not regularly replaced could increase the risk of infection.More recently, however, following the example in some Asian countries, some experts have suggested that covering the nose and mouth may be useful in stopping the spread of the disease.Lombardy’s president, Attilio Fontana, announcing the new law there, said people should “cover their mouths and noses” with a simple scarf, saying it would help “prevent you from spreading the virus if you happen to be a carrier”.Images from cities including Rome, Naples, Milan and Turin showed an increase in the number of people venturing out in recent days in the good weather. The Lombardy law will be in place at least until 13 April, when Italy’s lockdown is due to expire.On Friday Spain’s health minister, Salvador Illa, suggested the government would “probably” recommend the wearing of masks, though in many places they are almost impossible to find.Protective masks – both the specialised air-tight versions required by healthcare workers and the more basic surgical versions – are in desperately short supply around the globe and have become the subject of bidding wars between countries. China is the world’s largest supplier.The scramble for desperately needed medical equipment and protective gear has been most marked in the US, where it is causing intense squabbling between the states and federal government just as the nation is facing one of its gravest emergencies.In New York, the worst hit state, governor Andrew Cuomo said in a press conference on Sunday that there had been 594 coronavirus deaths in New York state in the last day for a total of 4,159, but deaths had gone down from 630 a day prior.“We could be either very near the apex or the apex could be a plateau and we could be on that plateau right now. We won’t know until you see the next few days,” he said.At a time when Christians would normally be celebrating Palm Sunday, the pandemic continued to disrupt traditional observances. Pope Francis marked the day in St Peter’s Square without congregants, while in China grave-cleaning ceremonies were severely restricted.Italy and Spain each expressed hope that their crises were peaking, though Italian officials said the emergency was far from over.According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, the reported global death toll neared 65,000 as outbreaks of the disease continued to flare up, including in Tokyo, which recorded a record daily increase in infections at 130.The number of people infected in the US soared to more than 300,000 as deaths climbed past 8,500. Many of the victims are in New York City but the outbreak is deepening elsewhere too.Greece moved to quarantine a second migrant facility after a 53-year-old man tested positive, the migration ministry said on Sunday.The Afghan man lives with his family at the Malakasa camp along with hundreds of other migrants and asylum seekers. On Thursday authorities quarantined the Ritsona camp in central Greece after 20 asylum seekers tested positive for coronavirus. It was the first such facility in the country to be hit since the outbreak of the disease.In China the spread of the disease has largely subsided but officials have been cautious about reopening public spaces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3430a84e31583388f069cec54021b404b9942200/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3457dbb6079e79b74adc4a4df77f907f","title":"market for chinese made masks is a madhouse says broker","story":"Manufacturers making huge profits supplying to whoever can pay the most and pay fastestThe scramble for face masks has created a “madhouse” atmosphere among Chinese manufacturers, who are making huge profits as customers around the world fight to be the first in line.Producers of masks and respirators are demanding to be paid in full before the products leave their factories and are supplying whoever can pay the most and pay fastest, according to Michael Crotty, a textile broker based in Shanghai.Crotty, of Golden Pacific Fashion and Design, said he had spent all of Sunday dealing with a flood of new enquiries from US states, national governments, cities, hospitals, distributors and private companies seeking to protect their employees.“It’s just a madhouse,” he said. “Money talks. The factory knows one thing: what’s in my bank account and when did it get there? And if it gets there before the other guy then that’s who is going to get the production time.”“The factory doesn’t care,” Crotty said. “They’re getting orders from people they’ve never heard of before. It’s a really unusual circumstance to have these factories absolutely in the driver’s seat. And they’re in the driving seat not of a Volkswagen but of a Mercedes limousine.”Wearing masks has long been common in parts of Asia to combat air pollution and the spread of disease, but until now was rare in Europe and the US.The masks on the market range from thin cotton coverings to fine-mesh surgical masks and respirators that form a seal over the mouth and nose and have to conform to strict specifications.Some European countries are weighing up whether to advise the public to wear masks when not at home. Last week the CDC in the US issued guidance recommending wearing a mask in public spaces. Trump has shrugged off the advice so far, saying: “This is voluntary. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.”French and German officials blamed the US last week for using “wild west” tactics to outbid them, but Crotty said the outbidding appeared to be an all-against-all affair.Over the weekend authorities in Berlin withdrew a claim that the US had “seized” a shipment of 200,000 respirator masks ordered for the city’s police force, a claim that led to an accusation of “modern piracy” from Berlin’s state interior minister, Andreas Geisel.According to Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, the police now say they were outbid while the respirators were in transit at Bangkok airport. The Berlin authorities say it is unclear where they went and who the ultimate buyer was.Der Tagesspiegel reported that the masks were made by the US manufacturer 3M, but it has denied any involvement in the transaction.The company has come under intense public pressure from Trump in recent days for continuing to supply masks to other countries. On Thursday he invoked the Federal Production Act, which dates back to the Korean war era and has given the administration the right to use “any and all authority” to procure the protective equipment it needs.3M issued a statement on Friday saying that cutting off supplies of protective equipment to Canada and Latin America could cause a humanitarian crisis, but Trump stepped up his attacks on the company over the weekend.“The people that have dealt with them, have dealt successfully with many companies over the last month, And they don’t like the way 3M has treated our country. They don’t frankly like the representatives of 3M,” he said.At the same time, stung by widespread reports of shoddy masks imported from China, Beijing took action to regulate producers. However, Crotty said the effect of the regulation has been to cut off supply. Beijing is only giving certification to companies that have previously sold on the Chinese domestic market, but Crotty said four-fifth of the factories he dealt with manufacture solely for the export market.Crotty said everyone involved in the market was trying to improvise in unique circumstances. “None of us have ever seen anything like this. The reaction to the pandemic in the US was not very well prepared. So I think hopefully there’ll be big lessons learned through all of this, when this tapers off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3664638966312ed4abdfc3f2d2d5a3b6b7c4b09a/21_0_1799_1080/master/1799..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1af6d103464f329d00fd206e0b143416","title":"queen urges britons stay strong coronavirus covid lockdown","story":"In a special broadcast, the monarch said we will overcome the coronavirus crisis if we ‘remain united and resolute’The Queen has praised Britain’s “national spirit” in facing the challenge of coronavirus as she evoked wartime memories to reassure those “feeling a painful sense of separation from their loved ones” to take comfort in the fact: “We will meet again.”In only the fifth special televised broadcast, other than Christmas messages, of her long reign, she said: “While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal.”“We will succeed – and that success will belong to every one of us,” she said.And she drew on the memories of her first broadcast to the nation some 80 years ago, when she and her sister Margaret made a radio broadcast for Children’s Hour.Speaking with a picture from that first recording visible behind her, she said: “We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety.“Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones. But now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do.”She added: “We should take comfort that, while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again: we will be with our families again we will meet again.”The government hopes that an intervention from the Queen, planned in close consultation with Downing Street, will help to shore up public commitment to the self-isolation guidelines amid fears that warmer weather could lead some to waver.There had been speculation the Queen might broadcast on Easter Sunday. But it is understood that both Buckingham Palace and Downing Street ultimately agreed on Sunday night as the best moment to maximise the impact of her speech. A senior No 10 official said Buckingham Palace and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, “have been speaking throughout” about the timing.“The Queen is the best judge of when to talk to the country and we absolutely agree that now is the right time,” the official said. “We have asked the country to make huge sacrifices and life is very difficult at the moment for a great many people. Hearing from Her Majesty the Queen at this time is an important way of helping to lift the nation’s spirits.”Elizabeth, 94 this month and said to remain in good health, recorded her message at Windsor Castle, where she and the Duke of Edinburgh, 98, are staying for the foreseeable future during the pandemic.The broadcast was filmed in extraordinary circumstances, with only one cameraman, wearing personal protective equipment, allowed into the White Drawing Room with the elderly monarch, to mitigate the risks to both to her and others.In a rare and deeply personal address to the nation and Commonwealth, she acknowledged the “pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones”.She praised NHS frontline workers, care workers and those carrying out essential roles, “who selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of all of us”. She told them: “Every hour of your hard work brings us closer to a return to more normal times.”She also thanked those who were staying at home, “thereby helping to protect the vulnerable”. In a rallying call, she added: “Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it.”Her hope, she said, was that those in years to come would look back and say that this generation of Britons “were as strong as any”. She added: “The pride in who we are is not part of our past, it defines our present and our future.”It was, she said, an increasingly challenging time of disruption: “a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all”.Her message incorporated footage of NHS frontline staff, workers making deliveries, the armed forces constructing the NHS Nightingale London field hospital and video of the #clapforourcarers moments around the country, along with pictures of rainbows drawn by children.“The moments when the United Kingdom has come together to applaud its care and essential workers will be remembered as an expression of our national spirit and its symbol will be the rainbows drawn by children.” she said.Apart from her Christmas message, it is rare for the monarch to make a special televised address. She has previously done so at the time of the Gulf war in 1991, on the eve of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, on the death of the Queen Mother in 2002, and on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17f2565b684281a2e9a99e65d6c90293830e2991/0_298_5760_3456/master/5760..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1318e4b971590ac00b608498fcdc93f1","title":"scottish fruit farmers recruit thousands locals save harvest","story":"Students and laid-off bar and restaurant workers given jobs as pickers after urgent appeal Scottish fruit farmers have solved a recruitment crisis that could have resulted in this year’s harvest of strawberries, blueberries and raspberries being destroyed.Several thousand people, including students and restaurant and bar workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak, have taken low-paid fruit-picking jobs in Tayside and Fife normally done by seasonal workers from Bulgaria and Romania.Farmers across the UK have said fruit and vegetable harvests are threatened by lockdown measures that have prevented tens of thousands of workers from flying in from eastern Europe for the picking season.Recruitment agencies have proposed chartering special flights to bring in workers from the continent, but in Tayside most vacancies have been filled by locals after an urgent appeal from farmers to fill 3,200 vacancies.James Porter, a fruit farmer who helps run Angus Growers, an organisation with members in Angus, Perthshire and Fife, said most of the 19 farms that took part in the appeal had filled all their vacancies. “We’ve had a big response,” he said. “It’s very encouraging and it gives me a bit of hope we might still be harvesting our crops.” Many were students whose university courses had stopped and who normally had summer jobs.Picking for the first crops would start in two weeks, Porter said, and picking for berries grown in heated tunnels had already begun. Picking would accelerate in May and peak from June onwards.He said fruit picking was a skilled and demanding job, requiring speed, dexterity and knowledge about which fruit to pick. Migrant workers had been doing this work for 10 to 15 years, he said, and were extremely fast.New recruits also needed to learn how to work safely with machinery and equipment, and maintain physical distancing while picking to reduce the risk of contracting coronavirus.He said it would take time and training for recruits to develop the skills his normal workforce had, and it was unclear whether the people who had signed up for this season’s harvest would turn up or stay on if they found the job too demanding.Local recruits may also leave if their old jobs return and universities resume teaching once the lockdown is relaxed, he added. “A lot of things have to line up and work this summer. We really are in uncharted territory.”Similar problems confronted asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower andbrussels sprout farmers this summer, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eb7eb68d516b06426105d4e10e839c4297ae0f0/0_0_4488_2693/master/4488..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b4ef953a8ba714eb5f62d9a7b820bb2","title":"uk government commits pilot no interest loan scheme coronavirus","story":"Campaigners say scheme for lower-paid workers should be accelerated in face of coronavirus crisisThe government has committed to piloting no-interest loans for people on low incomes, but is resisting calls for the support to be accelerated to tackle the coronavirus recession.The coronavirus crisis has prompted concerns that people on low incomes could fall through the gaps in the government’s support, causing them to look to payday lenders and other providers of high-cost credit to pay for essential goods during the lockdown, when they are unable to look for work.A Treasury-commissioned report found that a no-interest loan scheme (Nils) would be feasible, with money either loaned by a central government body or by existing lenders, with a potentially quicker rollout. Funding could come from government, levies on the banking or gambling sectors, or the National Lottery, the report said.Such a scheme would mainly target lower-income earners who cannot afford to repay interest on loans of between £200 and £2,000, although they would still have to repay the amount borrowed. The study found that more than 400,000 people in Britain would be eligible.The report was published last month by its authors, the consultancy London Economics, but has not been published on the government’s website despite being completed last year. A Treasury spokesman said the government would pilot the scheme, but declined to give a timetable or to say if it was considered by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, as a coronavirus relief measure.In the past fortnight almost a million people have applied for universal credit, the main form of income support, despite large incentives for businesses to retain workers.“If there was ever a time to recognise the need to reform access to credit it is now,” said the Labour MP Stella Creasy,who has campaigned against high-cost credit. “That the Treasury has evidence on how to do this makes the case even more compelling for action as it shows it’s possible even when there isn’t a financial crisis looming.”Peter Tutton, the head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, said no-interest loans should be expedited, alongside the more flexible application of universal credit and help for community lenders and credit unions.“With nearly 10 million people already under financial pressure before the current crisis, it’s vital to find better alternatives to high-cost credit that can spiral people into worse debt,” he said.The Treasury-commissioned study was an initiative kicked off by the former chancellor Philip Hammond in the 2018 budget in an attempt to stop payday lenders ripping off poorer customers.A Treasury spokesman said: “The chancellor has announced an unprecedented package of support for workers and businesses.”The spokesman pointed to policies increasing universal credit and tax credit payments by £7bn and said the government was “helping the most vulnerable with their council tax bills through a £500m hardship fund”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3658ecc5940f5978ccc027d1c1469745530a8cca/92_307_2840_1704/master/2840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24e405a64a511500bb6a2b5f995456d6","title":"what happens lungs coronavirus covid 19","story":"Respiratory physician John Wilson explains the range of Covid-19 impacts, from no symptoms to severe illness featuring pneumoniaWhat became known as Covid-19, or the coronavirus, started in late 2019 as a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause. The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus – severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19.Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms.So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? Australia spoke with Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician.He says almost all serious consequences of Covid-19 feature pneumonia.Wilson says people who catch Covid-19 can be placed into four broad categories.The least serious are those people who are “sub-clinical” and who have the virus but have no symptoms.Next are those who get an infection in the upper respiratory tract, which, Wilson says, “means a person has a fever and a cough and maybe milder symptoms like headache or conjunctivitis”.He says: “Those people with minor symptoms are still able to transmit the virus but may not be aware of it.”The largest group of those who would be positive for Covid-19, and the people most likely to present to hospitals and surgeries, are those who develop the same flu-like symptoms that would usually keep them off work.A fourth group, Wilson says, will develop severe illness that features pneumonia.The WHO says the elderly and people with underlying problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.When people with Covid-19 develop a cough and fever, Wilson says this is a result of the infection reaching the respiratory tree – the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside.He says: “The lining of the respiratory tree becomes injured, causing inflammation. This in turn irritates the nerves in the lining of the airway. Just a speck of dust can stimulate a cough.“But if this gets worse, it goes past just the lining of the airway and goes to the gas exchange units, which are at the end of the air passages.“If they become infected they respond by pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacs that are at the bottom of our lungs.”He says lungs that become filled with inflammatory material are unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, reducing the body’s ability to take on oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.“That’s the usual cause of death with severe pneumonia,” he says.Prof Christine Jenkins, chair of Lung Foundation Australia and a leading respiratory physician, told  Australia: “Unfortunately, so far we don’t have anything that can stop people getting Covid-19 pneumonia.“People are already trialling all sorts of medications and we’re hopeful that we might discover that there are various combinations of viral and anti-viral medications that could be effective. At the moment there isn’t any established treatment apart from supportive treatment, which is what we give people in intensive care.“We ventilate them and maintain high oxygen levels until their lungs are able to function in a normal way again as they recover.”Wilson says patients with viral pneumonia are also at risk of developing secondary infections, so they would also be treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics.“In some situations that isn’t enough,” he says of the current outbreak. “The pneumonia went unabated and the patients did not survive.”Jenkins says Covid-19 pneumonia is different from the most common cases that people are admitted to hospitals for.“Most types of pneumonia that we know of and that we admit people to hospital for are bacterial and they respond to an antibiotic.Wilson says there is evidence that pneumonia caused by Covid-19 may be particularly severe. Wilson says cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect all of the lungs, instead of just small parts.But Wilson says this “first responder mechanism” can be impaired in some groups, including people with underlying heart and lung conditions, diabetes and the elderly.Jenkins says that, generally, people aged 65 and over are at risk of getting pneumonia, as well as people with medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or a chronic disease affecting the lungs, heart, kidney or liver, smokers, Indigenous Australians, and infants aged 12 months and under.“Age is the major predictor of risk of death from pneumonia. Pneumonia is always serious for an older person and in fact it used to be one of the main causes of death in the elderly. Now we have very good treatments for pneumonia.“It’s important to remember that no matter how healthy and active you are, your risk for getting pneumonia increases with age. This is because our immune system naturally weakens with age, making it harder for our bodies to fight off infections and diseases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e58eb0dd833c0394167676518d7da943f7a8e9fb/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fb9a132c86120b4ac617a868bad0a6f","title":"youtube to suppress content spreading coronavirus 5g conspiracy theory","story":"Decision comes as four more phone masts are attackedYouTube will reduce the amount of content spreading conspiracy theories about links between 5G technology and coronavirus that it recommends to users, it has said, as four more attacks were recorded on phone masts within 24 hours.The online video company will actively remove videos that breach its policies, it said. But content that is simply conspiratorial about 5G mobile communications networks, without mentioning coronavirus, is still allowed on the site.YouTube said those videos may be considered “borderline content” and subjected to suppression, including loss of advertising revenue and being removed from search results on the platform.“We also have clear policies that prohibit videos promoting medically unsubstantiated methods to prevent the coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment, and we quickly remove videos violating these policies when flagged to us,” a YouTube spokesperson said.“We have also begun reducing recommendations of borderline content such as conspiracy theories related to 5G and coronavirus, that could misinform users in harmful ways.”The company’s decision to reduce the visibility of content linked to the false theory came as Vodafone said that two of its own masts, and two it shares with O2, were targeted. Three other masts were subjected to arson attacks last week.Nick Jeffery, Vodafone UK’s chief executive, said: “It beggars belief that some people should want to harm the very networks that are providing essential connectivity to the emergency services, the NHS and the rest of the country during this lockdown period.”Amir Khan on Sunday became the latest celebrity to share the debunked theory on Sunday in a series of Instagram videos. The theory, which has been described as “dangerous nonsense” by cabinet office minister Michael Gove, has also been promoted by Woody Harrelson and Amanda Holden. One video, removed by the site after the  flagged it, featured a man claiming to be a former executive at a UK mobile network falsely stating that coronavirus tests were actually used to spread the virus, and that the pandemic was created to hide deaths from the mobile technology.But variations of the video have been available on the site for weeks, and shortly after it was taken down, the  found another three versions of the same recording uploaded to different channels.In a statement, Mats Granryd, the director general of the GSMA, the global communications industry body, said: “The telecoms industry is working around the clock to keep vital health, education and emergency services online, businesses running, and friends and families connected. It is deplorable that critical communications infrastructure is being attacked based on outright mistruths. We urge everyone to trust health authorities and rest assured communications technology is safe. There is no link between 5G and Covid-19.”YouTube says that since early February, it has manually reviewed and removed thousands of videos that spread dangerous or misleading coronavirus information. For other videos, it has applied its main tool for fighting the spread of misinformation: a text link that takes users to the NHS information page about Covid-19. That box was visible on some, but not all, of the videos flagged by the .The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.“We’ll continue to evaluate the impact of these videos on the UK community and look forward to continuing our work with the UK government and the NHS to keep the British public safe and informed during this difficult time,” the YouTube spokesperson added.The site’s refusal to remove entirely misinformation about 5G may set it on a collision course with the UK government. On Sunday, the Observer reported that the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, is to hold talks with platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Twitter to “hammer home” the message that spreading 5G misinformation is unacceptable.Last week, mobile phone masts in Birmingham, Merseyside and Belfast were set on fire and broadband engineers faced physical and verbal threats from people who believe that 5G signals are responsible for the global pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

There has been criticism over the high prices, an issue that appears to have heightened existing exasperation over the UK’s failure to send charter flights earlier like other countries including Germany which has repatriated 42,000 of its citizens around the world. Another said it was “absolutely appalling that those stranded in Punjab were not told sooner they would not be included in the first phase of repatriations”. Thompson said in response that the Foreign Office was “looking to arrange flights for British nationals from other locations”. Public Health England said 11,085 tests for coronavirus were carried out on 8,651 people on Saturday in England. A tweet by the Department of Health added that PHE gave the testing capacity for inpatient care in England as 12,799 tests per day.The announcement comes after a total of 12,334 new people were reported as being tested in the 24 hours up until 9am today. The equivalent figure for yesterday had slipped below 10,000, having previously been above 10,000 for two days in a row (see 3.07pm).Here are some further full lines from the presser.When asked if people are safe to visit family if they have been following the social distancing guidelines correctly, Hancock said uncertainty over how the disease is spread means they should not. This virus can spread in all sorts of different ways, both from directly respiratory and also through objects and through touching objects that others then touch - the uncertainty over who has it, especially before they have symptoms, means that the only effective way of bending the curve down is to reduce that social contact. That’s why we came to the conclusions we did, difficult conclusions, that we have to have such extraordinary social distancing policies in place and why we took the decision more than a week ago now to flip the basis of those rules from saying you can’t do certain things to saying you must stay at home unless you’re doing one of a small number of things.Harries said there is an important distinction between the terms “family” and “household”. Previously you might have had four or five students living in a flat under one roof, sharing cooking, bathrooms, all sorts of things - that in infection control terms of things is a household. If your family lives in a different town, they are an entirely different household and mixing those two is not what we want to do generally. Stay with the people you live under the same roof with and keep doing that for as long as you can.”During the press conference, health secretary Matt Hancock said he could not provide an exact figure on how many more ventilators the NHS could have in place over the next week.But this morning he told Andrew Marr that “there should be another 1,500” in a week’s time. He told the Downing St briefing: The production from domestic manufacturers is starting to come on stream. The key goal is to always keep the amount of critical care beds - which nearly all need ventilators - above the demand.We haven’t got an exact figure for how many we will deliver next week not least because when we bring them in from abroad there are risks to the timing.Speaking to the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, he said: We need to make sure we have more ventilators than there are people who need ventilation. At the moment we have between 9,000 and 10,000 ventilators within the NHS right now and we have the 2,000 spare that are critical care beds with ventilator capacity should people need to come into them and we’re ramping that up. The answer is that our goal, instead of the 30,000, is that we need 18,000 ventilators over the coming two weeks.” Asked how many there will be in a week’s time, he said: “There should be another 1,500.” The government had already appeared to revise down its 30,000 target for ventilators. Scotland’s chief medical officer is withdrawing from daily media briefings during the coronavirus pandemic, after it emerged she had twice visited her family’s second home in Fife. Dr Calderwood will remain in the post and continue advising the Scottish Government, but the current advertising campaign which features her will now be revised, according to first minister Nicola Sturgeon. I am acutely aware of the importance of public trust in the advice the government is giving to stay at home in order to save lives and protect our NHS. To maintain that trust we will be revising our public information campaign and the chief medical officer will be withdrawing from media briefings for the foreseeable future. She will continue to provide the Scottish government with the scientific and medical advice on the spread of coronavirus.Although he raised the possibility of an extension of the lockdown earlier today, Hancock said the government is not looking at tightening the rules on exercising outdoors.“What we are doing is being absolutely clear that the current rules must be followed,” he said. He said the rules are designed to include exercise to protect people’s physical and mental wellbeing. It is not just what you are doing but how you are doing it. If you are sitting on a park bench, people tend to accumulate - it is very difficult to prevent that. Having rules where we are getting all of the benefits and minimising the risks and harms is an important approach to maintain. We have set those rules, we are enforcing against those rules and we will reiterate those rules, because that is the best way to be able to bend the curve down and stop the spread of the virus.At the beginning of the news conference which was not broadcast due to a malfunction, Hancock said he offered his “profound sympathies” to the families and friends of those who have died. He added: “I’ve lost two people that I was fond of so I understand what a difficult time this is for the country.”Harries said that transport use in the UK had been down since February but needed to be sustained. As the secretary of state has said it’s really important that we continue to do that despite the good weather so thank you to the members of the public that have observed that and please ensure that we keep moving in that direction.On the number of lab test reported cases, Harries emphasised the need for caution.You will be aware that our capacity is increasing all the time on laboratory tests. So we need to interpret this with a little bit of caution. We are following to a certain degree an epidemic curve and we can see the rise and we will of course in due course be looking to see that level off, but you will notice that over the last 24 hours or so there is an apparent big surge there.

Photograph: PA  Firms within the Irish pharmaceutical industry have sourced a raw material from Europe that can be used to produce scarce chemical reagents that has delayed coronavirus testing.Global shortages in supplies of reagents used by labs to test swab samples taken from suspected Covid19-infected patients has meant testing fell dramatically short of Government targets. The shortage meant the State’s health authorities could only carry out 1,500 tests a day, far short of its daily target of 15,000 tests. HSE chief executive Paul Reid said last week that Ireland was in a “chase around the world” with other countries to access supplies of reagents. Widespread testing is seen as a key objective worldwide in the fight against the virus. Chemical materials used to make the reagents are also in short supply given the demand in many countries. Pharmaceutical companies sought to help the Department of Health and HSE with testing by using their own networks of suppliers to source raw material to make the reagents within the State.The firms were seeking a specific chemical compound called guanidine thicyanate in order to make a solution called a reagent called lysis buffer that is used to inactivate the virus and break open cells in order to identify their genetic make-up to confirm whether a patient has the virus. The compound was sourced by Clonmel company Camida. If it arrives in Ireland over the coming days, reagent can be produced for testing within weeks.“We hope to get it in next week. It is waiting to be shipped,” Matt Moran, director of the pharmaceutical industry lobby group BioPharmaChem Ireland told The . “If we can get it in next week, we should be able to start making it. It will be weeks rather than months. We are aiming to get it out in the next couple of weeks.” The group believes that it can source chemical material to make enough reagent in the State to be able to carry out around 500,000 tests. The lobby group did not want to disclose the name of the European country where it has sourced the raw material given the level of demand for it.“Finding it has been a bit of an achievement. There were a number of countries looking for it and we beat them to it,” said Mr Moran.The pharmaceutical companies which hoped to make the reagents for use as part of the HSE testing are multinational firms operating in Ireland. “These plants are all in production and fully operational. They don’t want to be named. They want to do this as a kind of national interest effort,” he said.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4221499.1586108110!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"scotland s chief medic sorry for breaching coronavirus rules to visit second home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tScotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon (left) and chief medical officer Dr Catherine Calderwood.

Why?While the smaller population of some of the eastern European nations must of course be taken into account, it seems their more recent experience of emergencies has stood them in better stead than their more pampered neighbours. Georgia’s Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia, of the Georgia Dream party, told the Daily  it wasn’t just down to its “early and decisive executive action but because: “Georgians have experienced and overcome adversity throughout history.“Both the Government and the Georgian public quickly realised the scale of this threat,” he added. “Early action was crucial­ both to fight the virus and to protect the economy.”As Alexander Scrivener of the Eurasia Democratic Security Network recently explained in a paper on the subject: “Being rich doesn’t guarantee effective policy in a time of crisis. Early signs are that wealthier European countries have tended to respond less effectively than poorer ones - at least initially.”Comparing Georgia with the Netherlands, which both confirmed their first cases at roughly the same time at the end of February, he theorised that “the real number of Dutch cases is in the tens of thousands, while Georgia is likely still in double figures” because the former closed its borders, introduced strict social distancing measures and halted all air traffic while the latter’s reaction was “highly complacent.”In Holland, he added: “Business as usual was king. Preventing “panic” (which there was no evidence of) was prioritised over actually combating the virus.”As he endorsed a plan for ‘herd immunity’ as ill-fated at Britain’s Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte even proudly boasted that theirs was a “down-to-earth nation”. Only when the deaths started mounting did the government begin to act and introduce, largely voluntary, social distancing. As in Sweden, the Dutch are now facing criticism for their lackadaisical approach. Scrivener puts the vastly differing approaches down to the fact that countries with a ‘recent memory’ of facing major societal crisis have innately responded much more proactively than those without such chequered histories. “What links the Asian countries that have so effectively contained the virus, post-Communist states like Georgia and austerity-battered southern European countries like Greece is recent memory of crisis. Conversely, countries that have enjoyed relative calm and prosperity, even in the wake of the 2008 crash, like the Netherlands, UK and USA, were notably slow to even recognise the threat.”Professor Kataryna Wolczuk, Professor of East European Politics at the Centre for Russian, European and Eurasian Studies, agrees.“It isn’t just that some of these former Soviet countries have encountered more adversity, it is also that they already know their health care systems cannot cope. People in the UK know they can rely on the NHS - expectations are exaggerated.”Pointing out that post independence in 1991, the 3.7 million strong Georgian population had to grow used to regular electricity “blackouts” and having to bribe doctors for treatment, she added: “They have in their living memory times when it was really tough. They know they have to self-preserve and that they cannot afford to be blase.”Now medical professionals, the police and the military are no longer corrupt in Georgia, they are put on a pedestal by the population. “If a doctor says something then the people of Georgia will listen and obey,” the professor added. “They are used to obeying orders.”She added that this was in marked contrast to countries like Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Belarus, where more authoritarian governments were “keener on trying to spin a success story than solving the issue.” Mistrust of those governments meant fewer people tended to follow the guidance. Igor Grazin, a major force in the Estonian independence movement and elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1991 under Boris Yeltsin, said smaller European countries like his were benefiting from their experience of border control and providing overseas aid in times of crisis.“When you have a country like Estonia that has fought for independence then it protects its borders better than many others, he said.“We have spent years preparing for Russian invasion, so by comparison coronavirus isn’t that difficult.”A state of emergency was declared there on March 13 after coronavirus was brought to Saaremaa Island by the Italian volleyball club Power Volley Milano, that participated in the 2019–20 CEV Challenge Cup. All public gatherings were banned, including sports and cultural events schools and universities were closed and border control was restored with health checks at every crossing and entry point.Explaining how the country’s military medical service had been deployed to treat the diseased and dying, he added: “Smaller countries like ours, because we can’t contribute troops and tanks like the UK, France and Germany, our function in NATO operations has always been to provide medical support. We have a very effective medical corps and corps of engineers who have served out in the middle East and Africa dealing with other diseases. So our speciality in medicine has come in very useful.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/11/01/TELEMMGLPICT000145320425_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"do not fooled keir starmer no centrist","story":"While Corbyn spouted the politics of the student union, Starmer waged his own ideological battle to stop BrexitAside from Jeremy Corbyn, there can be no other Labour politician who bears more responsibility for the party’s crushing defeat at the last election than Sir Keir Starmer. While Corbyn spouted the politics of the student union and opened the door to toxic extremism, Starmer was waging his own ideological battle – to stop Brexit.As shadow Brexit secretary, he offered sincere assurances that Labour would respect the referendum result. But, as director of communications at No 10, I saw first-hand how Labour’s new leader sought to block our departure from the EU. I sat in on many of the cross-party Brexit talks and witnessed how he would frustrate any progress with endless objections. This reached farcical levels on one occasion when he branded the language of one government document as totally unacceptable, only to be told the text had been cut and pasted from a Labour paper.Ultimately the public was not fooled, either by the “lawyer’s Brexit” that Starmer offered up or by public assurances that Labour would respect the referendum. He now has a mountain to climb when it comes to reconnecting with voters. How he approaches the terrible Covid-19 pandemic will be a major test of whether he can win back their trust.If ever there was a time to transcend the boundaries of political tribalism, it is now. The Prime Minister yesterday wrote to party leaders urging them to “work together” with the Government. But will Starmer be able to resist playing politics with this pandemic? My guess is not. In his acceptance speech, he insisted he would work with the Government but would “challenge” and “call out” ministers if necessary. He went on to lay out a key battle line that will emerge when Britain breaks free from the pandemic – public sector pay.It seems, as with Brexit, that Starmer will insist he is putting politics to one side, while in reality indulging in the same old point-scoring. This political profiteering will only serve to ide when we should all unite. We are all on the same side in this war and Starmer would be wise to avoid going down this route. Daily press conferences mean the public have access to Government information as never before.They can judge for themselves whether ministers are doing everything possible. These ministers will rightly be held to account over the roll-out of testing – as they have been over protective equipment, intensive care beds and ventilators – but only those blinded by ideology would doubt their determination to beat this virus.I fear Starmer may be no more capable of breaking free from his own form of political tribalism than Corbyn was. He is not from the hard Left of the party like his predecessor – but he’s no centrist either. He is a true believer in the ideology of woke. As a human rights lawyer, he has dedicated his career to pursuing radical change in society through the courts, and being well paid for it. He represented poll tax rioters and striking print workers at Wapping. He helped eco-warriors in their bid to physically block road-widening schemes and often worked against the police.He is fully signed up to the articles of faith of the London metropolitan elite: supportive of open-door immigration, fiercely anti-Brexit, suspicious of patriotism and desperate to blame society rather than criminals for crime. The reason Labour lost dozens of seats in the North and Midlands was that traditional Labour voters realised the party was distant from their concerns and beliefs. Worse, it had contempt for them.So yes, Starmer will bring order to the grotesque chaos of today’s Labour Party, he will make his arguments in a reasonable tone and he will get a hearing. But in the end he is too immersed in the gospel of the progressive elite to be able to reach out to the communities abandoned by Labour. Above all, he won’t do the crucial thing that all successful leaders of the opposition do: he won’t challenge his party activists to look at themselves in the mirror and ask why the public rejected them.The Labour leadership election lasted for months, but not once did its eventual victor challenge the prejudices of Labour members. Political parties win elections by moving out of their ideological comfort zones and standing firmly in the mainstream, where the general public is. That’s why Keir Starmer is not the answer to Labour’s problems.Sir Robbie Gibb is a senior adviser at Kekst CNC and a former director of communications at 10 Downing StreetThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Iceland is doing both.Mr Gudnason\u0027s team of 60 police investigators and healthcare workers act as detectives on each confirmed case, tracking down those they have come in contact with.  Testing is carried out by The National Health Service on those showing symptoms. But on top of this, a biopharma company, deCODE Genetics, has been screening random samples of the population to build the world\u0027s most extensive study yet of how the virus behaves in a population.Early results show 50 per cent of carriers of the virus are asymptomatic. It has also revealed up to 40 \u0027mutations\u0027, or strains, of the disease. They claim to have traced strains back to Italy, Austria, the US, and seven cases in particular to one undisclosed football match in the UK.Crucially, all the testing has meant Iceland has been able to avoid a lockdown or quarantine as cases are tracked, traced and isolated before spreading rapidly - thus alleviating pressure on the hospitals.The data rolling in has meant authorities can more accurately design methods of controlling the virus, Mr Stefánsson says.So far there is a government ban on gatherings of more than 20 people and light guidelines on social distancing.The guidance is imposed not by force but by trust, Katrín Jakobsdottir, Iceland\u0027s prime minister, tells The  .Iceland has a history of socially liberal culture, she says. That means acceptance of differences and minorities, but in this case, it means to trust, not to force. We have no tradition of militarism or an army. We ask for cooperation, rather than force it.  She adds that the science approach allows her to leave the virus policy out of the battlefield of politics.The limited guidelines means business is slow for most shops, but with few exceptions the country is open for business.Icelanders can still get their morning coffee, sit down at local bookshops. Even stop at a local ice-cream parlour.At Reykjavík Roasters, a small but popular independent cafe in Reykjavík\u0027s centre, customers trickle in despite the pandemic. The city\u0027s centre is unusually calm.“Honestly, what I miss more than anything are the public pools” pensioner Auður Styrkásdóttir says apologetically, adding “this is a luxury.”One of the main benefits of Iceland\u0027s system is the school programme has been largely unaffected.Pre-schools, primary, and secondary schools have stayed open while higher education has moved online.Some people have taken to social media asking why children\u0027s safety is perhaps taken less seriously than those of adult students.Mr Gudnason points out that closing down institutions that serve children has a more significant social impact Our study suggests that children are less effective in spreading this virus than adults. We measure every decision with it\u0027s effectiveness and closing these institutions is unlikely to produce meaningful results at this time.Part of Iceland\u0027s success story is it\u0027s readiness.We realised at the end of 2019 that we should prepare for a pandemic, Mr Gudnason says.Our emergency system is clear, it is efficient and importantly frequently in use. Be it storms, avalanches, volcanic eruptions or a pandemic the system is the same. Health authorities step into a well-oiled machine, highly trained infrastructure and years of experience in building communication channels and trust.On Friday the head of Iceland\u0027s response, Víðir Reynisson, warned against drawing too much from the Iceland model, pointing out that the country\u0027s size, strong channels of communication and social cohesion helped.There are many factors that make things easier on us, he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"523 words queen gave us comfort hope united resolve need now","story":"It was the moment we had all been waiting for.Cooped up indoors like battery hens, facing an Easter separated from our loved ones, the nation needed the kind of rallying reassurance that only the Queen can provide.In these strange times of self-isolation and social distancing, there was only ever going to be one person Britons would willingly invite into their living rooms on a Sunday night. Forget Joe Wicks’ workouts or Carol Vorderman’s maths: here was the Queen of them all, delivering her own lesson, not just to the home-schoolers but their anxious parents, and their exiled grandparents and great-grandparents. From selfless NHS workers, to hard-working shelf-stackers, to the newly unemployed - this was a message of hope for all. “If we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,” she insisted, echoing the gospel song. After nearly seven decades on the throne, this remarkable nonagenarian is well practised in the art of providing calm in times of crisis and even in the face of an invisible enemy, she did not disappoint.With characteristic subtlety, the best and arguably most tear-jerking line came at the end, when she evoked the spirit of the Blitz with the words: “We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again we will be with our families again we will meet again.” Few could fail to have been reminded of those wartime morale-boosting performances by forces sweetheart Dame Vera Lynn - but at other moments, the rousing rhetoric was positively Churchillian. At nearly 94, the monarch was at her most personal yet, managing to trump that extraordinary moment following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales when she spoke “from my heart as your Queen and a grandmother.”Back then, she addressed the nation on live TV with hundreds grieving in The Mall behind. At 8pm last night, it was just the lone sovereign in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle - filmed by a solitary masked cameraman for four and a half soothing minutes.Fourteen Prime Ministers and 13 US Presidents may have served under her but by her own admission, even the Queen has experienced nothing like Covid-19.Yet having spent the past seven decades building a world-renowned reputation as a beacon of stability and continuity, of course she knew exactly what to say and how to say it.Her carefully chosen words - 523 in total - combined a rare tone of nostalgia with the sort of stoicism that has stiffened the British upper lip over centuries.Yet unlike that cliched caricature, the words of comfort were delivered with the compassion of a great grandmother. Here was the Queen acting not as Head of State but ‘Mother of the Nation’.Too often the Royal Family has stood accused of being too detached from the rest of us. This was an opportunity to foster a spirit of togetherness not seen since the Second World War - and the former Auxiliary Territorial Servicewoman grabbed it with both hands.Cleverly, this was not just about stressing that rich or poor were in the same boat but sharing in the universal frustration at the choppy waters we are currently having to navigate. Yes self-isolation is hard, but why not make the best of a bad situation, she wisely suggested. Seize the moment to step off the hamster wheel for once. And while you’re at it, give yourself a pat yourself on the back for how well Britain has responded to this extraordinary challenge. After several weeks of having to endure the political partisanship and academic ambiguity of recent Downing Street press conferences - there was a sense that we didn’t just need to hear it - we needed to hear it from HM. For only a woman of the Queen’s vintage could credibly deliver the immortal line: “Those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.” Pure Winston.Similarly the point about following the lockdown rules not because you’ve been told to - but because it’s right - was only plausible from someone whose entire reign has been characterised by putting duty first. For regardless of what the republicans might have you believe, the Queen knows more about self sacrifice than most.In drawing on her own childhood memory of her very first broadcast, when a then 14-year-old Princess Elizabeth addressed evacuee children alongside her 10-year-old sister Princess Margaret, she managed to convey a palpable sense of empathy. Lest we forget that she too lived through the horrors of the war - with Buckingham Palace bombed while the young princesses were apart from their parents at Windsor Castle. And as someone who used to spend as long as six months on official royal tours, she is all too familiar with the “painful sense of separation from loved ones” she spoke about.Who better than the world’s most travelled and Britain’s longest reigning monarch to provide a guarantee that Britain will get back to normal? “We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us,” she insisted. Coming from someone who has kept calm and carried on through all manner of crises - both personal and global, finally it didn’t feel fanciful to start believing it.   Having continued to receive her \u0027red boxes\u0027 of state papers while self-isolating with Prince Philip, 98, the Queen’s advancing years appeared no barrier to her keeping up with the latest developments outside the castle confines. Referencing the ‘rainbows’ that have been made by children the length and breadth of Britain and the Thursday night Clapping for Carers, she showed she is still very much across the detail.Now we have a constitutional monarchy, the days of sovereigns ordering about their subjects are long gone. But the instructions from the woman dubbed ‘the Boss’ behind palace gates was clear: remember those British qualities that define us all.For in telling the nation to take pride in the “attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country,” she could have been talking about herself. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus diary postcard new delhi can india truly lock","story":"This week marks exactly one year (!) since I moved to India and became an adopted Delhiite. I will remember this Monday morning not for that milestone but ‘India is walking home,’ a headline plastered on the front of the Indian Express newspaper.  On March 24, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared the country would endure a three-week total lockdown. Over the weekend, millions of Indians left temporary homes in the cities, having lost their jobs, to migrate hundreds of kilometres on foot back to home villages.Heart-breaking stories covered the front pages, migrants were collapsing and dying from exertion en route.The end to the largest migration in Indian history since Partition was a very sobering state to what would be an incredibly eerie week.  It’s fair to say New Delhi doesn’t usually do subtle or serene, it makes London look shy and retiring. I never thought I’d say this - but falling asleep without the sound of incessant car-horns and stream of some of New Delhi’s 30-odd million inhabitants clamouring outside my door is proving difficult to adapt to.It’s a beautiful spring day in New Delhi.  One week into lockdown, it’s 32 degrees and air pollution has plummeted to an AQI of 41 - it was well over 200 in March last year. I make the most of this by doing a handful of press-ups on my balcony, to the amusement of my German diplomat neighbours.Later, with Dr. Martens boots on, jeans tucked into socks, rubber gloves tightened and N95 face mask tied, for the first time in seven days I ventured out: I have no idea what to expect.Cheena, an Indian photographer, and I are putting together a dispatch regarding the local situation.  Travelling on New Delhi’s quiet main roads takes a long time due to regular checkpoints, our press credentials being scrutinised by stick-wielding police.  On reaching the neighbourhoods it quickly becomes apparent that this is not a European style lockdown.The vast majority of Indians, living in cramped and unsanitary conditions, simply can’t afford to quarantine and repeatedly we are told it is a choice between staying indoors and starving to death or continuing to work at the risk of catching coronavirus. Later, Cheena and I are forcibly escorted from a slum near the Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station by a group of heavies, who angrily blame foreigners for spreading the virus.Look, how the tables are turning on you, laughs Cheena.Today\u0027s challenge: trying to buy groceries.It is becoming very apparent that the lockdown here is only partially being adhered to, few people own fridges and therefore cannot store food for longer than several hours in the Delhi heat.I am very fortunate to have a small fridge but it still needs regular re-stocking.Unlike in London, there is no luxury of popping to a Tesco  or doing a \u0027big shop\u0027.I will have to travel to the nearest market - several kilometres away - via a cycle-rickshaw, the only form of transport still running.The journey is one that puts any frustrations I may have at being stuck at home, on my own, into perspective.My driver, Rakesh, has a raking cough and fever but can\u0027t afford not to work as he has 12 family members to support.While he furiously pedals and mops his brow, we cycle past large groups of Indians waiting in vain by the side of the road in the hope a charity will provide free food. It is evident despite the phenomenal efforts of the Delhi Government - which is providing food aid to 1.2 million people - a large proportion are still going hungry.I feel guilty with the ease at which I am able to buy my essentials in the market and my quality of life compared to many.One theka owner I know well even gifts me a bag of beers.New Delhi has been dry now for several weeks so it\u0027s no small gift.Sadly, I do not take full advantage by smashing half the bottles in the bag during the bumpy cycle rickshaw ride home!In my neighbourhood of Jangpura, it is typical for each house to have a guard, who lives on-site.Laxman, my guard, has seen me returning home at my best (and absolute worst) over the past year but like many millions, he has left New Delhi to return to his home village in Bihar.I have promised to look after his dog - the aptly named ‘Doggie’ - in his absence.Since lockdown began, the streets of New Delhi have become overrun by street dogs, who are responding to their freedom by chasing mopeds and cycle rickshaws with a new vigour.Watching Doggie wolf down chicken jerky I provide three-times-a-day strangely provides my lockdown with welcome structure.Other than that, social interaction is at an all-time low.It is thanks to Zoom and HouseParty apps that I haven’t entirely lost the plot and I spend the evening participating in a giant pub quiz, organised by my friend Joe, with ex-university mates at home.I struggle with the contemporary British culture round but am delighted when ‘In which Indian city can the Gateway of India be found?’ comes up. My team finishes in a close second.Looking forward to a similar quiz on Sunday with journalist friends in New Delhi - the Bhangra music round promises to reward the seasoned hacks.What better way to finish the working week than with the latest televised address from Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.Switching from his usual 8pm headliner slot to a more subdued morning affair, he implores us to take to our balconies with candles on Sunday evening for nine minutes as part of a ‘challenge to the darkness of coronavirus.’A journalist friend wryly comments that Mr. Modi could begin with eradicating the near-constant power cuts in New Delhi as the first step in his battle against darkness.Admittedly, India certainly needs all the help it can get - every day brings a record number of new cases, we’re up to a total of 2301, although this is thought to be a gross underestimation.  I fear the worst is yet to come.Work has been so busy this week that I haven’t had too much time to panic about what is going on around me or dwell on my isolated existence though. My adjacent neighbourhood - a sprawling city within New Delhi, called Nizamuddin - has been identified as one of India’s ten coronavirus hotspots.Concerned friends, who have been over to visit from the UK message with a heartfelt, ‘Isn\u0027t that where you live?’So I will be bolting down the hatches this weekend and doing some painting - in a supreme act of kindness, an arty journalist friend dropped off a spare easel outside my door earlier in the week. I wake up this morning to a slew of angry tweets from accounts supportive of Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party.Indian Twitter can be a maelstrom at the best of times and it seems a video we have done highlighting the risks India faces during the outbreak has inevitably ruffled a few feathers.Despite the hot sunny weather, it\u0027s hard to avoid the feeling that things will get much worse here before they do get better.The total number of cases across India has doubled over the past three days. Civil society unrest is on the rise and accounts of attacks on healthcare professionals and foreigners, both accused of spreading the virus, are particularly shocking. Pharmaceutical companies warn supplies of essential drugs could run out this month and I can\u0027t help but wonder whether this might tip things over the edge.A friend from Bihar calls to complain about his agonising toothache and how there is currently no possibility of any non-emergency treatment in India. We joke about some potential home remedies but decide against them. Even in these most uncertain of times, you have to find reasons to laugh.In Chhattisgarh state, a 27-year-old woman gave birth to twins after a near-impossible journey to hospital under lockdown.

At the time we had the first case reported in Norway, coronavirus testing was already available at labs in the major hospitals. Our institute then made guidance and recommendations for PCR diagnostic testing, and it was rolled out to diagnostic labs across the country.The country has since tested 101,986 people for the virus, or 18,996 per million people - compared to little over 2,250 tests per million people in the UK.The country\u0027s enormous testing capacity may be part of the reason why it has been so successful in keeping the virus under control, with just 66 deaths recorded as of Sunday. “We are one of the countries that has tested the highest percentage of our population and the assumption would be that the more you test, the more mild cases you will have among the confirmed cases, and more mild cases in the denominator will impact the estimation of the mortality, said Mr Vestrheim.He said that widespread testing may also have made it easier to slow the spread of the disease. The more you test, the more people with mild symptoms you find, and you can also do contact tracing and quarantine around people with those mild cases, he said.Some 5,208 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Norway, meaning less than five per cent of those who have reported symptoms and been tested turned out to have the virus. Dag Berild, a medical doctor and Associate Professor at Olso University Hospital, argued that the low level of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in Norwegian hospitals may also have played a role in the low mortality rate.Many of the influenza pneumonia cases are complicated by bacterial pneumonia, so if that is also the case with coronavirus, then patients in a country with a low resistance rate among bacteria would have a better prognosis than those in Italy, where they have an awful lot of resistant bacteria, particularly in Lombardy, he said.Mr Vestrheim said that expanding Norway\u0027s testing capacity had not been easy. There have been shortages of analytics, for equipment to do the extraction before the PCR testing, for the swabs that you use to take the specimens, he said. There\u0027s also a huge shortage of protective equipment for health personnel.But it had been helped by the fact that Norway has more than 20 public testing labs in hospitals around the country, as well as ones run by private providers.The health service in Norway is quite decentralised because of the geography, so we have diagnostic labs all across the country and a good collaborative network among the labs, he said.As well as testing, Norway has for decades had amongst the highest number of confirmed cases of whooping cough in Europe. This, he said, had made it easy for his institute to roll out the tests rapidly across the country.Initially we had this quality control mechanism where all the positive specimens were confirmed here at our institute, but gradually more and more labs have established good quality assurance, and so it\u0027s more and more widely available around the country.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"italys priests pay ultimate price comfort dying coronavirus","story":"A rosary slung over his shoulder, a smile visible beneath the transparent respirator strapped to his face, Father Cirillo Longo raised both fists above his head in a gesture of celebration as if he had just scored a goal.“See you on the other side, in paradise,” the 95-year-old said in his last telephone call before passing away in the northern Italian city of Bergamo last month, shortly after the picture was taken.The photograph symbolises the high price that is being paid by Catholic clergy in Italy, where 120,000 people have been infected and more than 14,000 have died as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.Priests have succumbed to the virus as they tended to the dying, trying to offer a shred of comfort in the absence of the patient’s loved ones, who are not allowed to say the final farewell for fear of being infected.Clergy have swiftly mastered unfamiliar technology, relaying the last words of dying patients via WhatsApp and other platforms to their relatives.“They die alone,” said Aquilino Apassiti, a priest from Bergamo, who spent 25 years as a missionary in the jungles of Brazil and now works in a chapel attached to the city’s hospital.“In the Amazon I dealt with leprosy and malaria but I have never seen scenes as shocking as those of recent weeks,” the 84-year-old told La Stampa newspaper.Like all clergy in such situations, he has to wear a face mask when tending to dying patients. “It’s awful because I cannot even offer a smile to those who are ebbing away.”Doctors and nurses, exhausted after long shifts and with their faces bearing the red raw marks left by face masks, often ask him to say a prayer for them.Families are left to grieve without the comfort of funeral rites that have been embedded in Catholic tradition for centuries.The pandemic in Italy has taken a terrible toll on medical staff, with more than 10,000 infected and nearly 70 doctors losing their lives.But what has received less attention is the impact it has had on Catholic clergy, killing more than 90 priests as well as dozens of missionaries, monks and nuns.Many of them worked in care homes for the elderly, hospitals and prisons and so were particularly exposed.“The deaths of doctors get our attention, but there are many priests who have fallen victim while working as well. There are so many painful stories,” said Alessandro Rondoni, director of the office of communications at the Archdiocese of Bologna.  In scenes unthinkable just a month ago, bishops across Italy visited cemeteries last Sunday to livestream prayers and Mass for the souls of those who have died of Covid-19.Ethiopian bishop Angelo Moreschi, 67, became the first Catholic bishop to die of the virus last week.  Moreschi, who had spent decades as a missionary in Gambela, Ethiopia, contracted the virus while in Italy for a medical treatment and died at the Salesian seminary in Brescia last week.The diocese of Bergamo has lost 25 priests,  the diocese of Milan 11 and the diocese of Piacenza-Bobbio six, including Don Paolo Camminati, aged just 53 years, from the city of Piacenza on the border of Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy.“Camo”, as he was affectionately known around town, was especially popular among young people, church officials told The , having taught in several schools and spearheaded numerous youth and community projects, including Alpine treks and social events that sometimes would end with him pulling out his guitar to sing a tune.He fought coronavirus for nearly a month, but only after his death last week did his family, friends and parishioners realise from the letters and messages arriving how widely he had reached out to the poor and marginalised in the surrounding area.Most Italian hospitals have small chapels, a quiet refuge where nurses, doctors and families of patients pray and process the psychological distress of what they have witnessed.Across Italy, regional diocese have set up special task forces to set protocol and protect the health of chaplains and priests called to administer last rites, pray alongside dying patients or bless the coffins and urns in mortuaries and cemeteries that are now closed to the public.The virus has also raced through monasteries and convents across Italy.In the Saveriani care home for retired missionaries in Parma, the virus killed 12 men who had spent their careers battling the harsh conditions of Africa and South America.More than half of the 41 sisters in the Little Missionary Sisters of Charity in Turin came down with the virus in mid-March and five have since died, including the mother superior. A similar outbreak happened in the two convents outside Rome, where nearly 60 sisters tested positive.Pope Francis has tested negative for coronavirus and has stubbornly resisted efforts to move him from his Santa Marta residence inside the Vatican to a safer location, despite the fact that several prelates living close by have tested positive.His solemn Orbi et Urbi (which translates as ‘To the city – of Rome – and to the World’) prayer for an end to the coronavirus pandemic was delivered last week to a deserted, rain-swept St Peter’s Square.As the Pope venerated a crucifix that was carried through Rome in 1522 when the city was praying for an end to the plague, the service was live-streamed to the world.It was a vivid demonstration of how the Catholic Church has had to quickly ramp up digital communications during the lockdown in order to provide pastoral services to its 1.2 billion faithful.As Easter approaches, the centuries-old message of the Catholic Church is the same, but the methods are changing.Priests are recording and livestreaming masses on You Tube and other social media channels.One parish priest who conducted his service to an empty church filled the pews with printed-out selfies of his parishioners to give the proceedings an element of humanity.Father Giuseppe Corbari, from Robbiano, north of Milan, said he had been saddened to see the church devoid of faces and so put out an appeal for people to send in photos.“I was very moved by the response,” the priest said. “These are terrible times and we need to stay close to each other. I’m still celebrating Mass, but it is with greater joy now because all the faithful are in front of me.”Other priests have eschewed digital technology but come up with innovative real-world ways of connecting with their parishioners.A priest in the town of Bibione near Venice took a statue of Christ from his church, strapped it to the back of a three-wheeled van and had himself driven around the community as he recited prayers.In a village in the mountains of Abruzzo, in central Italy, a priest decided that if the faithful could not come to him in church, he would come to them.Father Camillo Lancio loaded a statue of the Virgin Mary onto a trolley and wheeled it around the village of Picciano, ministering to people who leant out of their windows.Instead of the palm fronds or olive branches which would traditionally feature in blessings across Italy on Palm Sunday, the faithful are being urged to snap off a twig of rosemary or basil from the garden.They can then have it blessed through their television sets, computers or phones during liturgies that will be live-streamed from behind the closed doors of churches and cathedrals.Despite the grim death toll among clergy and the enforced separation between priests and their flocks, there has been a resurgence in religious faith as people under lockdown reassess their lifestyles and priorities.“This virus hit Italy hard,” said Father Gianluca Busi, a parish priest in Emilia-Romagna. “But I think my church will be fuller after all this. Many of us are seeing a rebirth of spirituality as people reconsider the things that are most essential in their lives.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed coronavirus exit strategy mass testing contact tracing","story":"The first hint of what Britain’s exit strategy from lockdown will be has been revealed by one of the Government’s top advisors.Prof Neil Ferguson, whose team at Imperial College London has been so crucial to driving the current strategy that he has been dubbed ‘Professor Lockdown’, said that mass testing and contact tracing would almost certainly replace current restrictions once numbers had fallen substantially.Prof Ferguson told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme that hospital admissions were now decreasing on a daily basis, and said he hoped that the epidemic would plateau within the next seven to 10 days.The number of daily deaths also fell over the weekend from 708 deaths reported on Saturday to 621 on Sunday, and Prof Ferguson said that overall deaths may end up being as low as 7,000. Until now it has been unclear how the Government plans to end the lockdown, with some experts forecasting that intermittent restrictions, or regional quarantines, could last until a vaccine or treatment is available.Boris Johnson is due to review the measures for the first time this week, but Prof Ferguson said that current restrictions could be lifted in a matter of weeks and set out what Britain would look like afterwards.Prof Ferguson said: “When the lockdown ends will depend really on what happens to this epidemic, how quickly case numbers decline. There is no point in having gone through this effort, and releasing the lockdown at a point where case numbers are high and then we’ll surge faster than we’ve seen before.“We want case numbers to get to a low point where we can start substituting other measures for the most intrusive and economically costly aspects of the current lockdown and almost certainly these additional measures will involve massively ramped up testing going back to trying to identify contacts of cases and stopping chains of transmission. “That can only feasibly be done when we have many fewer cases per day than we have at the moment.”The digital arm of the NHS is currently working on a contact tracing app which would notify people if they have come into close contact with someone who later tests positive for coronavirus, so that they can quickly self-isolate before passing it on to many people. It is a strategy that has worked successfully in other countries such as South Korea. And the Government has promised 100,000 daily tests by the end of April. Prof Ferguson also said that some other strategies may also be deployed, such as keeping vulnerable people in lockdown for longer or focusing on specific geographical areas. Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, has previously said that some measures may need to be in place for up to six months.“The precise strategy has not been formulated,” Prof Ferguson added: “It will be in the next week or two and it has the highest priority of the whole scientific and medical community.”Prof Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “A combination of some social distancing measures, extensive testing and automated contact tracing could allow both a more regular social activity and a significant control of the outbreak.”Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said the length of the lockdown all depends on how the British people behave.  He added: “I entirely understand people’s yearning to know how quickly we’ll be through this. If people follow the rules, and stay at home, even in the summer weather, then we’ll be through it faster and more people will survive.”Economists and mental health experts are increasingly warning about the impact of the lockdown, with Mervyn King,  the former governor of the Bank of England, arguing that people would begin to rebel against it, should it go on for months.A new report published this weekend by Gerard Lyons, the former chief economic advisor to Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London, and economist Paul Omerod warned that a long lockdown would wipe out large swathes of the economy and bring a negative impact both financially and mentally on too many people.The pair suggest that a traffic light system should be employed. Phase one - red - would see more shops open and strict social distancing maintained, phase two - amber - would allow unlimited car journeys and restaurants could open if people were kept apart, and green would allow mass gatherings again.It is likely that travel restrictions will be kept in place from areas which also have high infection rates. Prof Ferguson estimated that in the early stages of the outbreak, Public Health England (PHE) had only managed to trace and isolate one third of people coming into the country with the virus, which seeded the epidemic.But speaking on Radio 4 over the weekend, he said he was hopeful that some of the intense social distancing measures could be substituted with rapid access to testing and contact tracing in a few weeks\u0027 time - once case numbers are lower.“We want to move to a situation where at least by the end of May that we\u0027re able to substitute some less intensive measures, more based on technology and testing, for the complete lockdown we have now,” he added.Keir Starmer, the new labour leader, said that the Government must publish its exit strategy, which he said would be a combination of testing, followed by a vaccine.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"when lockdown end uk exit strategy","story":"For example, social distancing could be alternated on a regional basis to give people a rest from draconian restrictions. The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), has proposed that parts of the country could enjoy greater freedoms for six months at a time, before returning to lockdown.Germany, which is carrying out hundreds of thousands of tests, is planning to give certificates to citizens. If a working cure does become available in the coming weeks or month then lockdown will be lifted far sooner.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/21/15/credit-cards.jpg","title":"coronavirus overdrafts interest free credit card payments banks","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Credit card and loan repayments to be frozen for customers in financial difficulty as pandemic causes unemployment to soarBanks have been told to allow customers an extra £500 interest-free on their existing overdrafts\u0026nbspto help people who are struggling financially during the coronavirus outbreak.They have also been ordered to freeze payments on credit cards and loans.The City watchdog is proposing a range of measures that could be introduced as soon as next Thursday, to help those finding it difficult to make repayments\u0026nbspon their debts.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBanks had already been under scrutiny from the Financial Conduct Authority over their approach to overdraft interest rates, which are around 40 per cent for most high street lenders –\u0026nbsproughly double the cost of an average credit card.More people are likely to have to use their overdraft during the crisis.The Department for Work and Pensions revealed this week that it had received\u0026nbsp950,000 claims for Universal Credit in just two weeks.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastUnder the FCA’s plans, customers can ask their bank to freeze payments on their credit cards and personal loans if they are having trouble repaying because of coronavirus.However, consumers will still accrue interest on their credit cards during the repayment holiday, which they will have to pay off at some point.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: “This is yet another, important, welcome, yet unprecedented coronavirus-driven market intervention – this time by the regulator.“We have already seen many unsecured lenders put some forbearance criteria in place, a few even more generous than the minimum standards the FCA is imposing – such as entire overdrafts at 0 per cent.“However the provision is patchy and has become a banking lottery and that’s unfair – no one could’ve taken into account when they signed up for products how considerate each lender would be in these extraordinary times.”A brief consultation on the proposals is under way until Monday with changes to be implemented on Thursday, if agreed.

While its first series was a critical triumph, gained fans including Barack Obama and won many Emmy awards, the show\u0026nbsphas also been accused of being “bigoted”.Writer and filmmaker Laura Durkay wrote in the Washington Post in 2014: “Since its first episode, Homeland has churned out Islamophobic stereotypes as if its writers were getting paid by the cliche.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe following year, Arab graffiti artists who had been hired by\u0026nbspproducers to make a Syrian refugee camp look more authentic, secretly wrote: “Homeland is racist.” No one noticed\u0026nbspuntil the episode was broadcast.In a rare interview with , Danes said: “That was a good stunt. All of our hats were off to them.”Kate Russell: ‘We all participate in a culture that allows abuse’Netflix is releasing a bonus episode of Tiger King ‘next week’On the broader issue of racism in the show, she added: “I get it. I think it’s tricky and kind of inherently problematic, right? There are a lot of brown people in our story who are doing really bad things, and there aren’t enough opportunities to create a more balanced portrait of that demographic.“That was always going to be a point of vulnerability for us, but I also think that our heroes are really problematic and really flawed. We’re wrestling with some pretty challenging questions and ideas and those two sides of various arguments were personified by our characters.”She continued: “In most cases I think both characters were right. Our writers were fairly responsible about that, creating a real debate. In the first episode of this season we have the Palestinian politician who’s really challenging Saul and making credible, cogent points about the ways that America has failed. I was happy about that at least.”The first episode\u0026nbspof Homeland season eight\u0026nbspwas given three stars by The Independent’s critic Ed Cumming, who said “all its life” comes from Danes and her performance as CIA operative Carrie Mathison.He wrote: “Mathison’s troubled mind has always been a metaphor for government intelligence: brilliant but unreliable, vital but dangerous. Danes’ performance animates not only the scenes but the ones she is not in, too, and every time she’s out of shot you crave her return.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is vital that everyone adhere\u0026nbspto these requirements.“Police officers and staff are putting themselves in harm’s way day and night to explain these instructions to our communities, encourage co-operation and, where necessary, enforce them.”In a joint statement, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Wendy Chamberlain, the MSP and MP respectively for the area where Dr Calderwood has her second home, said: “It is difficult to see how the chief medical officer will be able to carry the important messages about the virus and the lockdown if she has not even followed it herself.”They added: “If we are going to get through this pandemic we need medical leaders who everyone can follow. It is with great regret that we say that the chief medical officer will need to go.”Scotland’s constitution secretary Mike Russell said there was no doubt Dr Calderwood’s visit was “ill-advised”. The\u0026nbspScottish Government confirmed it was an overnight stay to “check on a family home”.Mr Russell said she would be “answerable” for her decision when she appears at the daily coronavirus briefing with Nicola Sturgeon later today.He added: “I’m saying to everybody... do not go out except in the very exceptional circumstances that are listed, think about these things and remember by breaking them you are risking lives.”Scottish Police Federation general secretary Calum Steele said policing the pandemic had been made more difficult and stressed checking on a second home is not one of the “reasonable excuses” providing an exception to emergency coronavirus legislation.He tweeted: “In defending the indefensible has the Scottish Government not just thrown the CMO under the bus? Checking on a 2nd home is not one of the prescribed reasonable excuses.”Monica Lennon,\u0026nbspMSP for central Scotland, said in a statement on Facebook: “As the chief medical officer for Scotland, Catherine Calderwood beams that message into our homes on behalf of the government every single day, however, she has failed to practice what she preaches. Not only is this hypocritical, it is irresponsible and the first minister cannot accept this conduct.“Hundreds of Scots have died and there is no sign of the spread of the virus slowing. The CMO has undermined Scotland’s pandemic response and if she doesn’t offer her resignation the first minister should sack her.”Reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is a national effort and all of us should be asking what more we can do.”He said Labour would “do our bit to offer solutions” but would also “speak for those who have been ignored”, and expose mistakes where they are found “to ensure that they are rectified as soon as possible”.Sir Keir wrote: “And let’s be honest, serious mistakes have been made.“The public is placing an enormous trust in the Government at the moment: it is vital that that trust is met with openness and transparency about those mistakes and the decisions that have been made.”Sir Keir said the UK should build vaccination centres in towns and cities across the country so “the minute a vaccine becomes available, we can begin to protect the entire population”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is unacceptable. Unfortunately, the actions of a minority now means that, following police advice, Brockwell Park will be closed tomorrowWe are sorry we\u0027ve had to take this decision. This wouldn\u0027t need to happen if people followed the clear instructions from the Govt. We are doing this for the wider safety of the public. A minority of people have not followed the guidance - regrettably we have to act.His remarks come as ministers urged the British public to avoid leaving their homes this weekend for all but essential reasons, as the country experiences some of the warmest weather of the year so far.The latest government figures show a further 708 people in the UK had lost their lives after contracting coronavirus, including seven healthcare professions, bringing the total death toll to 4,313.Mr Hancock also insisted Boris Johnson was in “good spirits” as he continues to self-isolate in Downing Street after testing positive for the virus over a week ago. He has “very much got his hand on the tiller – but he’s still got a temperature,” the minister added.And the health secretary admitted it would be “hard” to meet the government’s target to roll out 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April, saying it would require “an awful lot of people to put their shoulders to the wheel”.He continued: “We set a goal of 10,000 tests a day by the end of March and we hit that goal. At the end of February we had under 2,000 tests a day, so we are on a very rapid ramp-up but we clearly need to see that go further.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Candidates had effectively suspended their campaigns last month as the infections of Covid-19 started to escalate in the UK.Coinciding with Mr Corbyn’s resignation, Boris Johnson also wrote to the leaders of opposition parties at Westminster, inviting them to a briefing of senior government advisers next week as he insisted “we have a duty to work together at this moment of the national unity”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And we have to remember that every number is a family shaken to its foundation,” he said.He added: “Our willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long. When millions of us stepped out onto our doorsteps to applaud the carers, visibly moved, there was hope of a better future. In times like this, we need good government, a government that saves lives and protects our country.“It’s a huge responsibility and whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That’s why in the national interest the Labour Party will play its full part.“Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition’s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that’s the right thing to do.“But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we’ll challenge that and call that out.”Sir Keir also said he was “sorry” on behalf of the Labour Party for the “stain” that antisemitism had brought on the party in recent years after allegations that have plagued the party under Mr Corbyn’s leadership. “I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us,” he added.Former leader Mr Corbyn, who had appeared with Ms Long-Bailey in her campaigning videos, also congratulated Sir Keir on his election victory. “Being Labour Party leader is a great honour and responsibility,” he said. “I look forward to working with Keir and Angela to elect the next Labour government and transform our country”.In a statement, defeated candidate Ms Long-Bailey said Sir Keir will be a “brilliant prime minister and I can’t wait to see him in No 10”, adding: “I will do all I can to make that a reality and to ensure the Labour Party gets into government with a transformative agenda at the next election.”Who will be in Starmer’s shadow cabinet?The left-wing group Momentum – set up to support Mr Corbyn’s radical, left-wing policy agenda in 2015 – said the organisation looks forward to working with him, but also pledged to hold him to account in the coming months and years.“His mandate is to build on Jeremy’s transformative vision, and this means appointing a broad shadow cabinet who believe in the policies and will work with members to make them a reality,” they added. “In this new era Momentum will play a new role. We’ll hold Keir to account and make sure he keeps his promises, champion big ideas like the Green New Deal, build the power of Labour members and do everything we can to get a Labour government elected.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic.From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction - you must stay at home.If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.Boris Johnson originally announced that these measures are in place for three weeks and they will be reviewed afterwards.The plan to reduce the spread of the highly contagious virus through social distancing like that seen in Europe since early March, will hopefully reduce cases and the pressure on our medical staff and NHS.Theof the lockdown will depend on how the UK responds to the measures and they will be reviewed around April , which is the Easter bank holiday Monday.A senior adviser said today that coronavirus lockdown could last until the end of May - with the pandemic levelling out in the next ten days.The PMs adviser told BBC Radio  the pandemic was expected to plateau in the next week to ten days - but said peoples behaviour was critical in determining what happens next.Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries has also told the nation that restrictions could remain for the next six months.If coronavirus cases and deaths drop, the lockdown could be lted when its next reviewed.While they will be reviewed in mid-April, the police currently have the power to enforce these measures for six months.Residents are only now allowed to leave their homes for one of four essential reasons:Johnson said: You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No.You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can.If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that for a first offence, the fine will be £and for a second offence it will be £ .These fines will double with each offence.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.The PM has ordered the closure of all non-essential shops, but he can ask businesses to do the same as well and stop people from going to work.Public transport also remains open to help key workers such as doctors and nurses but schedules have been cut back.Spain, Italy and France have been in national lockdown for a lot longer than the United Kingdom with those three countries badly affected by coronavirus.Italy has now banned all movement inside their country and closed non-essential businesses as the spread of coronavirus continues.This comes after  people died in the country on Saturday, March , and  more the following day in a frightening weekend.France went into lockdown on March  with police currently patrolling the streets to ensure people only leave their homes for essential reasons.Spain is in a state of emergency and has called for non-essential workers to stay at home for  days from Monday, March .There are tough restrictions in place in badly-effected areas such as Madrid with all educational institutions forced to close.Unlike in the UK, where people are allowed to exercise freely, this is not the case in these three Mediterranean countries.French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said: Going out to take the children for a walk or for physical exercise must be within a distance of one kilometre maximum of your home, for one hour, and obviously alone, once a day.In Spain, residents are only allowed outside for shopping or to walk dogs while in Italy all parks have been closed and people can only exercise around their homes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we’ve only been under lockdown for a week or so.But I’m slightly with Piers Morgan when he says “man up”.My dad was a working-class bloke from the North East of England.He got himself into a grammar school and had a chance to go to university. But the war stopped that.At  he was serving on a motor torpedo boat in the channel.My mum, meanwhile, was evacuated as a kid, taken away from her parents. Then her house was bombed flat.In  the Luftwaffe bombed our cities every night, death raining down.That strikes me as being real hardship.All we’ve been asked to do is sit on the sofa for a while, eating crisps.I think we can probably get through this, you know.THINGS nobody has been talking about, anywhere, since the crisis hit us.This last one is the most interesting.At times like this nobody caresyou’re black, white, brown, gay, transgender, Muslim or Jewish.Everyone grasps that we’re all in this together.If only, once this is over, we could understand that we’re STILL in all this together.And that identity politics simply causes unnecessary isions between us.ONCE this is all over the Chinese have a few questions to answer.Mainly about the degree to which their government has not been honest.Either about the start of the virus, deaths and the rate of infection right now.And what happened to the heroic Chinese doctors who tried to warn the world  At least one has disappeared.China is a devious, totalitarian and hostile country.

He hasn’t thought it through no matter how many chins of mine he might think he can sht, it ain’t worth spilling perfectly good lager or ales.Nevertheless,that hyperactive chancer can unite the nation, then someone like me who doesn’t go at ramming-speed the whole time can surely help. He’s the hare, I’m the tortoise.But what this is all about is morale. Morale is important: it’s the key component of any battle and that’s what we are in the middle of right now.And as we near the end of our second week in national solitary confinement, I imagine tempers may be fraying, time might be hanging heavy, maybe the way you’re rubbing along has got you chafing a bit: I know I am, I gave up bathing last weekend, I’m on my own, who cares what I smell like.So, here’s a cut out and loose guide to how to keep your morale up and avoid those moments which lord knows you’ll regret, because it’s not like you can go down the pub and moan to your mates about what happened.Dishwasher stacking disputes. You think the knives should point up not down.The amount of times people can fall out over this sort of simple day-to-day admin in normal le is something I’ve heard from my regular drinkers time and time again, so no doubt in lockdown-land this one is raging all day, every day.You know what: forget it. It ain’t worth it. Simply rule yourself out of stacking or emptying the dishwasher – problem solved.Deciding what to watch on the TV. We live in an age of a billion channels and nothing to watch. And they’re not making any more TV either: even Eastenders could grind to a halt. Yes that’s how serious this whole thing is. So whoever has control of the TV rules the roost.The remote is the key to this problem. Seize control: seeing as you aren’t going anywhere or doing anything, superglue the remote to the hand you use the least and retain control of the TV.This may seem extreme but it’ll simply mean there’s one great big argument when you reveal what you’ve done, rather than the long slow drip drip drip of anger about your third week of watching Homes Under The Hammer.Ironing and or folding the laundry. Ironing, for some, is a % flash point. This is how the argument runs. You leave something out to dry, then some thoughtless Herbert chucks it all in a laundry basket in a heap and you have to iron it.Immediately a row ensues about why there’s no need to iron tracksuit bottoms anyway and remember the time you burned that nylon shirt because you had the iron on too hot you idiot.Compromise. Now here’s the thing. It’s not like you’ve got anywhere to be. It’s not like your glad rags are going to get any attention over the next few days.Maybe you’re a slave to fashion and were looking forward to moving from your spring to your summer wardrobe. Whatever that means. But there is no need to iron stuff right now. None. Zero.So put the iron down. Unless of course, it’s something you like doing to calm the nerves, pass the time, inject some sense of order into what is currently a formless existence. In other words, let the ironer iron. But onlytotally necessary. Remember, in the end would you rather be right or happy  And the answer to that is happy. Unless of course what makes you happy is being right. But you get my point.And remember, chins up Britain, all of them.Hats off to all the people who two weeks ago were panicking and spreading rumours about the army being deployed.During the fortnight these Scary Maries were crying into their soda waters about imminent martial law the army quietly got on with setting up a brand-new hospital.

And we have a National Health Service to look after those who need care.A mobilisation never before seen in peacetime is under way across our health service and beyond. In the NHS our dedicated staff are pulling out all the stops to treat the patients we have and prepare for the surge we know is coming.We are now looking after more than , patients in hospital with confirmed coronavirus — a staggering increase compared with just a few weeks ago.That is more coronavirus patients than the number of hospitalised heart attack, stroke and cancer patients combined.And in a matter of weeks hospitals have managed to free up a further , beds, a third of all those normally available, for future patients with coronavirus.Of course, most patients the health service is continuing to look after have some condition other than coronavirus.And it is important that other patients still come forward for the urgent and emergency care they need without delay.Increasing our critical care capacity for those who are sickest is a top priority.And we are setting up new hospitals at a rate never seen before.The new NHS Nightingale in London is the most visible example of the extraordinary effort that is under way to tackle coronavirus.The NHS has joined forces with the military to achieve in days what normally takes years.More such hospitals are in train across the country — in Bristol, in Yorkshire, in Birmingham and in Manchester. I hope they won’t be needed, but we’re building them in case they are.They are an insurance policy in case the surge plans at existing hospitals are not enough.But these new facilities and kit are nothing without the staff that make the NHS what it is today — the institution our nation rightly holds most dear.More than , former nurses, doctors and other NHS staff have heeded the call to re-enlist for the battle against coronavirus.And many thousands of student nurses and medical students will be putting their skills and education into practice early as part of the enormous effort that is under way to save more lives.But the NHS cannot win this war alone. Companies and the Government are now pulling together to get us the extra equipment and supplies the NHS needs. British manufacturers are retooling production lines to turn out protective kit for doctors, nurses and other staff, giving their all on the front line.Commercial rivalries are being put aside as firms co-operate to develop new ventilators and other vital supplies.Labs are expanding their testing capacity, so NHS staff knowthey can safely get back to work.The public are backing our staff at this time of enormous pressure.I know how much it means to the nurses, doctors, therapists, cleaners, pharmacists, paramedics and countless others giving their all to fight coronavirus that the whole nation is behind them in this battle.The support of Sun readers will help sustain them in the days and weeks ahead.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealSo on behalf of the NHS, a thank you too to The Sun, for throwing its weight behind the Clap for Carers campaign to give NHS heroes the recognition they deserve.But the practical actions that iniduals and families take in the weeks ahead will also make all the dference.As other countries have shown, no health service in the world could cope with the number of patients who would need treatmentbetween us we failed to slow the spread of coronavirus.That is why the Government’s measures to stop people meeting and passing on the virus are so important.Nobody is finding this easy — whether it is missing a drink with friends in the pub, Sunday lunch with the family or uncertainty over jobs and wages this epidemic has created for so many.There are early signs this is working but this is a marathon not a sprint. What we need to remember is that right now every single one of us can be a le-saver just by following the medical advice.Every time you wash your hands you could keep someone off of a ventilator.

Since Boris Johnson declared the lockdown restrictions on our lives, officers have been accused by some of being overzealous enforcing them.They have tried to stop some shops selling Easter eggs because they consider them non-essential.A cop was also filmed threatening to fine a bakery owner for putting chalk on the pavement outside her shop to maintain social-distancing.Meanwhile, the Derbyshire force dyed black the Blue Lagoon swim spot in a disused Buxton quarry to deter groups from gathering there — and sent out drones to spy on walkers in the middle of nowhere.Road blocks have been set up to check motorists and cyclists are on essential journeys.Last weekend officers were also breaking up groups of more than two people on park benches, and football matches in parks.All of which could seem a tad heavy-handed.So you can see why some people are indignant, especially given the absence of clearer official guidance.Perhaps it is this lack of clarity that is partly the issue.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a recent daily press conference that police should use common sense in applying the rules and that the public should follow the guidance not just to the letter but also the spirit.The real issue, though, is some people’s inability to follow the very basic instruction to stay at home unless they really need to go out.If people were not disregarding this advice, police would not have to enforce it.Officers do need to be careful, though.We are willing to social-distance for the greater good but only as long as it is necessary — and will not tolerate it for a minute longer.We are not a police state and the police must be mindful of being too heavy-handed.So while shouting at someone for buying an Easter egg is ridiculous and using a drone to terrorise a lone dog walker does seem extreme, someone has to break up the cretins who are having barbecues or parties in high-density residential areas, right I do despair over the attitude of those mindless idiots who are still having parties and getting drunk together.Then there are the twits going to DIY shops to buy paint, which is hardly essential.People, this is not an extended Bank Holiday.

This is nowhere near good enough.As Boris Johnson croaked from his sick bed, mass testing among the general population is the ONLY way out of this national purgatory.But at the moment we do not even have widespread testing among our NHS workers.Right now we are letting down those selfless doctors, nurses and health carers.On Thursday night at pm, my street in North London resounded to the sound of grateful clapping for our carers.But as our frontline health workers start to die, they need more than a weekly standing ovation.They need us to understand that the lockdown rules apply to us all.Lucy Hutchings, , is a nurse caring for coronavirus patients in Southampton.In a Facebook post, shared , times, she wrote it is “devastating” to see so much suffering when there are still people not following simple rules about staying home, staying safe and protecting the NHS.“I’m scared, everybody I work with is scared,” wrote Lucy, her face etched with exhaustion after another gruelling -hour sht.“The quicker people stay indoors, the quicker it will be over.“I’d like to stay at home but I can’t, so for people to go against the rules is so stupid and irresponsible.“I keep myself away from my mum, dad and brother because I don’t want to pass the virus on. It’s a hard thing to do.”Lucy’s face should haunt us all.Remember it every time some thick-as-mince footballer wraps his expensive motor around a lamppost.Remember Lucy’s face every time you see people who think social isolation rules do not apply to them.Remember Lucy’s faceyou want to understand what a long way we have to go before we truly start supporting the NHS.Yes, it is hard for a people raised in freedom to obey these restrictive rules.But NOBODY has a harder job right now than those NHS workers who are risking their lives in under-equipped, overcrowded hospitals that are being pushed to breaking point and beyond.The health crisis is unprecedented in our letime but the Government cannot keep cocking it up.The NHS does not have the kit it needs, the testing it needs, the support it needs.Health Secretary Matt Hancock promises , coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.If Hancock does not deliver, get shot of him.Because right now, that “Protect the NHS” slogan is looking heartbreakingly empty.All foreign NHS workers who are out there now fighting on the frontline deserve British passports.If these foreign heroes are good enough to risk their lives to save our lives, then they have earned the right to stay in the UK for ever.CLAUDIA Schfer tells Elle magazine that at the height of her supermodel glory days she felt like a rock star.

Why the hell not As Iceland boss Richard Walker says: “We have spoken to the Government about this.“My hands are still tied with these archaic Sunday trading laws.“This is a moment of national crisis and we need our shops open.”When the current three weeks of lockdown ends next week, it will inevitably be extended.This will be a bitter pill for everyone in lockdown Britain.Scrapping the Sunday trading laws would make it easier to swallow.PRINCE William wants toto his air ambulance duties.Meanwhile, Prince Harry scuttles off to Los Angeles in the last private jet out of Canada before the borders closed.And the tragedy is that Harry would have been brilliant during our national emergency.Harry was born for mucking in, raising spirits and doing his bit.Can you imagine the reaction Harry would have got in an overstretched NHS hospital  What a waste.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was like her office.“Meghan is also a big fan of Erewhon, a super high-end natural foods grocer in West Hollywood, which was her health food holy grail.“She loves hiking and keeping fit, so she hopes to be able to do a few of her favourite trails, albeit with security in tow now.“She will have a private gym at the new pad, so it’s unlikely she will use one of her old spin studios like Soul Cycle.”Her mum Doria, who -year-old Harry is also close to, regularly visits the Agape Spiritual Center, a non-denominational church in the LA suburb of Culver City, and Meghan often used to accompany her to services.A source added: “That was a big part of their relationship and spiritual connection.“Some celebrities go there, so I wouldn’t be surprisedMeghan showed up there again.”The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealAlthough mother and daughter cannot see one another at present, Doria will be making extended visits to the couple’s home, once they get settled.The source continued: “Doria will definitely have a presence in their day-to-day le.“Plus, of course, she can act as a pretty wonderful babysitter for Archie.“Doria adores her grandson, and would be thrilled to help outcalled upon.”Not surprisingly, Meghan’s estranged dad Thomas, , will not be invited — even though he lives just  miles away in Rosarito, Mexico.The source added: “He is just noise for her at this point.“He would be a liability for her, with all the drama he brings to the table, while she wants to pursue a philanthropic .“Meghan has a young son now and her priority is her immediate family, her work and helping others where she can.”Undoubtedly Meghan will be using the next six months to focus on family time with Harry and their -month-old son.Being in LA, the duke and duchess are expected to employ personal trainers to get them fit for the summer months.One well-placed source also predicted the royal pair would be visitors to the Pilates studio of Meghan’s pal Heather Dorak.The insider said of the duchess: “I’m not surprised she came back.“It’s her home, and now she has the influence and star power she never had before. It’s the ideal situation for her.“She has been able to bring Harry into her perfect scenario.“I imagine she will just make it about enjoying the beach, fresh air, and being tucked away in the canyons.“Keeping it simple and finding her rhythm, being present and fit while raising Archie under the palm trees and the familiarity of her home town.“I think she will try to be very private and protective of Harry.“She will probably be getting him to make friends with the agents, managers and some stars but will try not to expose him to too many alien things.She has already got what she wants, to move to LA, and I don’t think she will want to push him too hard.”The ambitious pair have put any big announcements on hold following the outbreak of coronavirus.But a trio of power-players including Meghan’s agent at The Gersh Agency, Nick Collins, her business manager Andrew Meyer and lawyer Rick Genow, are already weighing up offers.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.A Gersh source said: “Nick has seen interest in Harry and Meghan go through the roof since they announced their split from the Royal Family.“Sure, he looks after her Hollywood opportunities, but also the volume of advertising and speaking opportunities is huge.“If they said yes to everything that was offered to them and Archie, they would be able to buy a £million Los Angeles home and have plenty of change left over.”Another home they are said to have had their eyes on is ,sq ft Petra Manor.It is in a private canyon complex called Serra Retreat, and was once owned by Hollywood actor Mel Gibson.The property, once rented by Kylie Jenner, was still available to view this week – with an eye-watering rent of £, a night.Along with Pacic Palisades, locals have also heard that Meghan and Harry are keen on a home in The Colony, the gated Malibu enclave where their neighbours would be actor Tom Hanks and former tennis champ John McEnroe. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When we do we must be candid about it and learn from it.Last night one source accused the doctor — who took the Hippocratic Oath to protect patients — of “dangerous double standards”.Scottish police visited Dr Calderwood today and issued her with a warning after she was caught flouting the lockdown rules.Scotlands Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said in a statement: Local officers visited Dr Catherine Calderwood and spoke to her about her actions, reiterated crucial advice and issued a warning about her future conduct, all of which she accepted.The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone.Dr Calderwood yesterday said there were “reasons” for what she did but that they did not justy her weekend visit.She said: “I wish to apologise unreservedly for the issue reported in the media today.“While there are reasons for what I did, they do not justy it and they were not legitimate reasons to be out of my home.“While I and my family followed the guidance on social distancing at all times, I understand that I did not follow the advice I am giving to others, and I am truly sorry for that.“I know how important this advice is and I do not want my mistake to distract from that.“I have a job to do as Chief Medical Officer to provide advice to Ministers on the path of this virus and to support the medical profession as they work night and day to save lives, and having spoken with the First Minister this morning I will continue to focus entirely on that job.”Sturgeon added: Over the past few weeks, as we have been dealing with this crisis, her advice and expertise has been invaluable to me.It comes days after SNP bosses called for powers to stop second home owners travelling to rural areas.A source slammed Calderwood decision and added: “Either we are in lockdown or not  I’m pretty sure government advice is to stay at home and not to travel to second holiday homes.“But Catherine Calderwood isn’t following the advice. She and her family are potentially bringing the virus to the area.”Wearing a turquoise jacket, Dr Calderwood looked like she didn’t have a care in the world as she walked with her family and dogs near her bolthole on Saturday.But locals in the quiet coastal town hit out over the seemingly unnecessary trip, which came after a working week in Edinburgh where she spoke at daily pandemic press briefings alongside First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.Residents accused her of failing to heed her own government’s advice that people with second properties should stay at home to protect rural communities during the outbreak.The source said Dr Calderwood was one of several other high-flyers from Edinburgh who had second properties in the area and were putting locals at risk.One onlooker told The Scottish Sun on Sunday: “They were going for a walk with the dogs. It’s weird.“I thought she lived in Edinburgh and that we were supposed to stay home — but this place is miles away.”On Thursday, Dr Calderwood shared a photo of her family outside her capital home taking part in the national Clap for Carers event.The image was posted as millions ventured on to their doorsteps to applaud our NHS heroes and care workers.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe snap was taken in the driveway of her upmarket West End home — said to be worth around £.million.Under the hashtag ‘clap for NHS’, the health bigwig told her , followers: “My family clapping my NHS and care colleagues — and me! Thank you all.”The following day the Cambridge and Glasgow Universities graduate attended an official Scottish Government press call where she delivered crucial public health advice alongside Ms Sturgeon.But the mum of three has now angered locals after she was seen walking her dogs with her husband and children across the golf course and heading towards the beach in picturesque Earlsferry, where she has a cosy bungalow.Dr Calderwood has given regular press conferences on the Covid- pandemic at St Andrew’s House in Edinburgh where she has repeatedly urged the public to stay within their homes.This weekend’s trip comes just days after Nats chiefs called for emergency powers to stop second-home owners self-isolating in rural areas, including the Highlands.MP Ian Blackford said legislation should be used to protect areas with less health infrastructure from visitors trying to flee the coronavirus.He spoke out after a number of communities reacted angrily as tourists blocked lay-bys and swamped camping areas.Mr Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, said: “With Easter almost upon us it is worth reminding everyone of the emergency powers that restrict non-essential travel.“That means no tourists should be coming to the Highlands and Islands.“If anyone owns a second or holiday home they should not be using the Highlands to self-isolate and powers exist and must be used to stop this.”Similar warnings have also been issued in England and Wales.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he did not consider people going to their holiday homes as an essential trip during the crisis.His plea followed concerns that rural health services could be overwhelmed by those leaving cities who then end up suffering from Covid-.Mr Hancock said: “We’ve said that people should not take unnecessary journeys, no unnecessary travel and I don’t regard going to your holiday home as a necessary journey.”Today it was revealed that a further  people have died from coronavirus in Scotland, bringing the total number of deaths to .The UK-wide total increased to almost ,.The latest deaths including a child aged just five — the youngest UK victim so far.The Scottish Government said , people had now tested positive for the virus, an increase of  from Friday.In total, , patients have been tested across the country.We told how people are now only permitted to leave their homesthey have “reasonable excuse”.This includes work that cannot be carried out at home, shopping for food and medical supplies and an hour of daily exercise.In the six days since new legislation was introduced, police officers have been forced to issue  fixed penalty notices to people who have chosen to ignore the measures.Belfast-born Dr Calderwood has pleaded with Scots to stay at home to protect the NHS and “help save lives” — including on TV and radio ads and at daily press briefings on the pandemic with Ms Sturgeon.The health chief is a trained consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist.She is also a member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and is an honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.When asked to explain the official view on travelling to a second home tonight, a Scottish Government spokesman said: “We strongly advise against any travel to second homes.“It runs the risk of adding pressure to services in more remote and quieter areas, from food supply to health care.”The Scottish Sun on Sunday then asked why the Chief Medical Officer was ignoring official advice.An SNP Government spokesman replied: “Since this start of this epidemic, the CMO has been working seven days a week preparing Scotland’s response.“She took the opportunity this weekend to check on a family home in Fe as she knows she will not be back again until the crisis is over.“She stayed overnight before ing to Edinburgh. In line with guidance she stayed within her own household group and observed social distancing with anyone she was in passing in the village.oliver.norton@the-sun"},{"url":null,"title":"swedens top coronavirus doc britains lockdown too far","story":"THE scientist leading Sweden’s battle against the coronavirus has claimed that Britains lockdown goes too far.Epidemiologist Anders Tegnell believes the UK shouldnt have abandoned its original strategy as bars, restaurants and schools in his country remain open.Sweden has currently recorded  deaths of the coronavirus, with just over , infections.This puts it far below Britain which is in lockdown, though it is around two weeks behind on the curve of the virus.Le in the country remains normal with cafes and restaurants packed, although PM Stefan Lovren has limited gatherings to  and urged Swedes to behave like adults.But doctors have warned that the country could be heading for a catastrophe as the virus continues to spread in public spaces.The countrys leading coronavirus doc Anders Tegnell, who studied at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the Mail on Sunday he is sceptical about the benefits of a lockdown.He said: I am very sceptical of lockdowns altogether butyou ever do them, you should do them at an early stage.At certain times I suppose they can be useful,you are unprepared and need more intensive care facilities, for example, but you are really just pushing the problem ahead of you.Mr Tegnell added that he believes his method of fighting the virus, while dferent to every other country, is producing results.He added: So far, what we are doing is working.

The other was Peter Sinclair, one of his mentors at the Bank of England - who was also David Camerons former tutor.And he warned those who were not complying: To the small minority who are breaking rules - you are risking your own le and the lives of others, and making it harder for us all.Mr Hancock told the BBCs Andrew Marr Show earlier today: Weve said because of the positive benefits to your physical and your mental health that its OK to exercise on your own or with members of your own household.Butthe result of that is that too many people go out and flout the other rules because they say wellI can exercise then its fine for me to do other things then Im afraid we will have to take action.If you dont want us to take the step to ban exercise of all forms outside the home, you have got to follow the rules.Lets not have a minority spoiling it for everybody.However, he admitted this evening at tonights press conference that the Government had no plans to change any rules imminently.No stressed that a ban on exercise was not about to be announced.He said it was quite unbelievable that some were openly ignoring the advice to only go outside for just four reasons - exercise, work, fetching medicine or food, or taking care of the vulnerable.We are crystal clear in the guidance what people should or shouldnt do, he stressed.This is not a request, its a requirement.People need to follow it.Mr Hancock also used todays daily briefing to urge people suffering to report their symptoms on a new NHS tracker app - to help better understand the virus.He also took the chance to have a pop at Scotlands Chief Medical Officer - who The Sun revealed had been caught travelling to her second home on two occasions despite telling others not to do so.These rules are for everyone, he said pointedly.And he stressed that although the lockdown measures were a huge challenge for the nation, social contact would mean so much more to Brits after it is lted.He told the country: I know what a challenge this can be for families.The cruel thing is that it thrives on social contact and the human bonds which bring so much to le.All the things we miss - going to a pub for pint, reading a book outside, or hugging a grandchild - we will have these moments again, and they will mean even more to us.Labours new leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would support tougher lockdown measures such as an exercise ban or stopping all non-essential workthe rules carry on being flouted.He told the BBC: We have to take whatever steps are necessary.The ignorant sunbathers ignored warnings from Britains chief nurse on Friday afternoon, who begged them to listen.Ruth May urged them to do it for the two nurses, both mothers, who lost their lives in the Covid- fight this week.Aimee O’Rourke, , and Areema Nasreen, , sadly passed away after treating coronavirus patients on the frontline.Two other healthcare assistants have also died in the last  hours - with nine medics now killed by the virus.Boris Johnson also stressed to the public they must avoid the temptation of enjoying the good weather this weekend.He said today: Thank you to everyone who is saving lives by staying at home this weekend.I know its tough, butwe all work together and follow the guidance, we will beat coronavirus.Britain was set for temperatures of  degrees today, and there are fears Brits will continue to flout the rules to get out and enjoy the good weather.Yesterday Brockwell Park in London said it would close after , people ignored the rules.Police in the UK capital were also forced to break up an th birthday attended by  guests who flouted the social distancing guidelines set out by the government amid the coronavirus outbreak.Surrey Road Police also shared a shocking video of Richmond Bridge in West London packed with people out walking along the Thames.In a tweet, they urged Brits to PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stay at home.Police were also out in force in Brighton in case Brits descend on the seaside town to enjoy the mini heatwave.But today Labours new deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said it was easy for Mr Hancock to advise people to stay inside when people have big gardens to go out in.She told Sky News Sophy Ridge on Sunday: Well its all right for people who have got big houses and huge back gardens to say that.But actuallyyoure stuck in inadequate accommodation, youve got no back garden, youve got nowhere to go and youre all on top of each other, quite literally, then I think people should do social distancing and should keep their distance but also be reasonable and proportionate about that.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal Mr Hancock also said that eight per cent of NHS staff are off sick with coronavirus -

It is not discounted.”Downing Street has said it “does not recognise” the claims made by the source.Some unfounded conspiracy theories circulated worldwide have claimed coronavirus is a kind of man-made bioweapon, but there is no evidence of this.Wuhan is home to the Institute of Virology, the most advanced laboratory of its type in mainland China.The £million institute is just ten miles from the wildle market which is believed to have been at the centre of the outbreak.Scientists at the institute were the first to link the new coronavirus to bats.The state-run People’s Daily newspaper also boasted in  that the lab was capable of conducting experiments with “highly pathogenic microorganisms”.Unveried local claims have suggested workers at the lab became infected after being sprayed with blood, and then carried in infection into the local population.The city also has a second lab - the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control , which is just three miles from the market - which is also believed to have carried out virus experiments on animals.Video emerged last week of a Chinese scientist catching bats for viral experimentation at the WCDC.The conventional wisdom is however still that the virus passed from bats to another animal and then to humans at one of Wuhan’s so-called wet markets.Following the coronavirus outbreak, China has issued new laws that call for facilities to ensure “biological safety” and improve management of viruses.A leak from a Chinese lab led to an outbreak of Sars that killed one person and infected nine others in .The Chinese government admitted the leak was down to negligence and that five officials were punished.China has been accused of attempting to cover-up the initial outbreak as the virus took hold in the city of Wuhan.A doctor who first warned about the virus was threatened by police, and then last month Chinese officials suggested the US military may have been responsible for coronavirus.China now claims it has weathered the virus storm, and yesterday mourned victims with a three minute silence as it positions itself as a world leader amid the pandemic.In a letter to the Mail on Sunday responding claims China would face a “reckoning” from Britain over the outbreak, the Chinese embassy hit back - but declined comment on the lab origin theories.Chinese embassy official Zen Rong said: “Such reports completely disregard the tremendous efforts and huge sacrice of China and its people, and deny Chinas signicant contribution to global public health and safety.“China wasted no time in identying the viruss pathogen, sharing the genetic sequence with the World Health Organisation, taking the most effective, strict and comprehensive measures to contain the spread of the disease, sharing experience with other countries in need, and providing assistance to more than  countries, including the UK, and to four international organisations.”In a statement, an embassy spokesman added: “There has been no scientic or medical conclusion yet on the origin of Covid-, as relevant tracing work is still underway.“The WHO has made repeated statements that what the world is experiencing now is a global phenomenon, the source is undetermined, the focus should be on containment and any stigmatizing language referring to certain places must be avoided.”Questions loom large of the origins of the outbreak, and whether or not the Communist Party have been truthful over their death toll.Biosecurity researcher Richard Ebright, a professor at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, said the coronavirus behind the pandemic was . per cent similar to a bat virus discovered by the Wuhan Institute of Virology in  and studied at the WCDC.He said: “Bat coronaviruses are collected and studied by laboratories in multiple parts of China — including Wuhan Municipal CDC and Wuhan Institute of Virology.Therefore, the first human infection also could have occurred as a laboratory accident.China’s top virologist on bat-borne viruses, Shi Zhengli, has sworn on her le that virus did not leak from her lab in Wuhan.She blamed the virus has being spread by “nature punishing the human race for keeping uncivilized living habits”.The researcher has told those claiming the virus came from her lab to “shut their stinking mouths”.But she previously admitted she had “lost sleep” fearing the virus may have leaked from the research facility.Politicians in both the United Kingdom and United States have previously urged China to be more open about what it knows about the coronavirus.Writing in thelast month, Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence select committee called from greater transparency from China.Mr Ellwood, a former captain in the British Army, said it would “irresponsible” to outright blame the Chinese military – but said his job requires he understands “threats facing the UK”.He wrote: “I would like to know more about the Chinese army’s [lab], coincidentally located a stones throw from where the latest outbreak began.”He added: “Successive US administrations have long believed that a number of countries, including China, maintain active biological programmes.“But without greater Chinese transparency we cannot be completely sure. China’s immediate response to the outbreak in Wuhan was to squash the story.“The Chinese doctor who first raised the alarm was obliged publicly retract his comments and charged with ‘rumour mongering’.”US senator Tom Cotton also suggested that the virus may have come from a research lab and also called for transparency from China.On Wednesday, he told the Daily Caller : The reason I have raised these questions from the very beginning is because of China’s statements and their actions“After concealing the virus for many weeks in December and then minimizing its severity for most of January, they then peddle an origin story about the food market in Wuhan.”“Given their dishonesty and the proximity of these labs, which we know were working with coronaviruses, it is only reasonable and responsible for us to ask the question and demand the answers.”US President Donald Trump has even raised questions over Chinas official account with regards to the death toll - but has also praised their handling over the outbreak.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealUS congressman Michael McCaul accused China of the “one of the worst cover-ups in human history” last month while speaking on Fox News.He accused the Communist Party of a “systematic whitewash” and called for an international investigation to “hold the Chinese government to account”.Mr McCaul, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said: “Now we have a global pandemic that originated out of Wuhan.“They allowed millions of people to come to Wuhan to celebrate their Spring festival.“Five million of them leading the area and traveling domestically and abroad – they went into laboratories and shut them down – destroyed laboratory samples and they detained eight of the doctors trying to speak the truth about what really happened in Wuhan.”In a statement, the Wuhan Institute of Virology said the conspiracy reports had “received close attention from all walks of le” and “caused great harm to our research staff on the front line of scientic research” back in FebruaryLab chiefs said staff had been working around the clock since the end of  to trace the source of the coronavirus and improve detection rates - adding the theories seriously interfered with their efforts.Despite the speculation however, the World Health Organisation praised China and President Xi Jinping for their handling of Covid- back in February.WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “The logic doesn’t support the idea [of a cover up].

Mr Johnson told Skyaposs Sophy Ridge: “All governments have a risk register, the Conservative governments had a risk register and on that risk register, the top of our risk register, was a pandemic.   We know they come along, there have been three every hundred years for the past  years so we know they are coming along… I am absolutely amazed at how badly prepared the government is for this. Mr Johnson said that as soon as he had become Health Secretary he had dress rehearsals for treating a pandemic. Number one on our risk register was this, number two was the kind of terrorist attack that we saw in Mumbai for the first time you’ll remember back in . Those two things were top of our Risk Register, we had dress rehearsals for them. When I first became Health Secretary in , I walked straight into a dress rehearsal for how we’d deal with a pandemic and how we would deal in this country with the kind of things we’re seeing now.” Mr Johnson was scathing about what he sees as the government’s sluggish response. He said: “I think the government has taken a right path now, eventually.   I think the two week lockdown has given the NHS a fighting chance and I think what we need to do now is not just wait for the vaccine, I think what will happen is that we’ll get better at testing, hopefully we’ll get the protective equipment that the NHS needs, we’ll see that curve flatten out so there is not the overwhelming pressure on the NHS that would have happened had we not taken these measures.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jacob rees moggs investment firm","story":"NewsJacob Rees-Moggs investment firm set to make fortune from the coronavirus crisisEXCLUSIVE: Somerset Capital Management, which the MP co-founded, says market volatility offers a “once or twice in a generation” opportunity to make “super normal s”ShareCommentsByAlan Selby:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video rees-mogg-announces-commons-agenda-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,articleTypeName:brightcoveVideo,url:https:www.mirror news politics video highlights-todays-covid-briefing-april-,articleUrl:,thumbnailUrl:https:cf-images.eu-west-.prod.boltdns.net v static  ceed---cd-ec fbec-cfc-fb--aeafc x match image.jpg,duration:,videoId:,isVideoRelation:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics jacob-rees-moggs-investment-firm-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The MP owns at least  per cent of a company investing in businesses hit by falling share values. Somerset Capital Management says investors have a “once in a generation” chance of “super normal s”. Mr Rees-Mogg stood down as a director of SCM to become Leader of the House of Commons. SCM said it was focusing on clients’ long-term security. It came as the UK death toll rose by a record  – including a boy aged five. As millions face financial misery, SCM managers are buying into businesses where valuations have tumbled – but should bounce back. Potential gains of  per cent are touted. Investments so far include private hospitals in Brazil, pharmacies in South Africa and a firm behind a scanning device which checkspeople are wearing masks in China. The revelation was greeted with dismay by new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who said: “Nobody should be seeking to take advantage of this crisis. We should all be asking ourselves what we can do for our country and each other.”Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell added: “This is about as sick as it comes. Profit seeking from suffering is nearly as low as you can get. When we come through this we need a tax on profiteers.” SCM’s strategy comes amid a crisis that has killed , globally, while a further ,, are infected. The UK death toll yesterday rose  to ,. Some , have tested positive. While the economic impact has seen almost a million Brits sign up for Universal Credit, finance houses have been quick to move. Mr Rees-Mogg, , stood down as a director of SCM so he could become Leader of the Commons last July. But he owns at least  per cent, meaning he was entitled to a reported £million share of last year’s £.million profits.Father-of-six Mr Rees-Mogg, who lives in a mansion in Somerset, is reportedly worth more than £million. That could risea plan by SCM’s Emerging Markets Discovery Fund pays off. Fund boss Mark Asquith said in promotional material that investors could capitalise on smaller companies in particular, with prices down up to  per cent. He wrote: “History has shown us that super normal s can be made during this type of environment. Market dislocations of this magnitude happen rarely, perhaps once or twice in a generation, and have historically provided excellent entry points for investors.”  Mr Asquith cited  per cent profits made after the  crisis and suggested “we could see similar moves”. SCM, which has a £.billion portfolio of client funds, is so keen to attract investors it has waived a .% management fee. Giving examples where they hope to profit, Mr Asquith’s co-manager Christopher White identied Hapvida, a Brazilian medical insurance company which also runs hospitals. It has a deal to care for patients in the public health system. Stock has also been bought in Clicks, South Africa’s leading pharmacy. SCM is also invested in Advantech – behind technology rolled out in China to monitor mask wearing and temperatures of people in public places. SCM was co-founded by Mr Rees-Mogg in . His office declined to comment last night.  The firm is managed in part via the tax haven of Singapore. In November the Sunday Mirror revealed SCM traded shares in a firm fined for its role in the  Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster. It also had holdings of £million in a Russian bank suspected of helping the annexation of Crimea and pro-Putin terrorists in the Ukraine.

The MP for Hemsworth, West Yorks, tweeted: “Keir has politely asked me to stand down from Shadow Cabinet. “I reaffirm my commitment to the cause of working class emancipation and to the North. “The struggle continues.” Key Corbyn loyalist Ian Lavery was sacked as party chairman, saying: “It has been an absolute honour and privilege to have been chair of this great party. “Solidarity to the new leadership and incoming Shadow Cabinet.” But Mr Starmer opted to keep on Nick Brown as Chief Whip, and Baroness Angela Smith will remain as Labouraposs leader in the House of Lords.

A large clear-out of the current frontbench cohort is widely expected when Sir Keir appoints his shadow cabinet, but some less well-known shadow ministers could be given more prominent roles. Anneliese Dodds and Nick Thomas-Symonds are among those being hotly-tipped for senior positions, while MPs on Sir Keiraposs campaign team could also be in line for jobs. Sir Keir, who entered Parliament in , has said Labour will make the argument for a better future under his leadership - but will first need to restore peopleaposs trust in the party as a force for good and a force for change.  Writing in the Sunday Times, he said: To begin to restore that trust, I will make it my mission to reconnect Labour with the public. I want to build a coalition in all parts of the country, no matter how people previously voted. We must be a party of government again capable of answering to the electorate across the whole of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Never again can Labour be a party that millions of people feel they cannot trust to govern, to manage our economy or to keep our country safe. Make no mistake: our party needs to change so that trust can be regained. We must become a credible government-in-waiting and get back to a position where we can make a real dference to peopleaposs lives. Where that requires us to rethink, we will. And where that requires us to apologise, we will.  Sir Keir also reiterated the apology he made to the Jewish community in his acceptance speech, saying Labour has been shamed over the past years by anti-Semitism.Shortly before the result was announced on Saturday morning, Boris Johnson wrote to opposition party leaders inviting them to a coronavirus briefing as he insisted we have a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency.LEADER Keir Starmer ,Rebecca Long-Bailey ,Lisa Nandy , DEPUTY LEADER Angela Rayner Rosena Allin-Khan ,Richard Burgon Ian Murray Knocked out in second round with .% Dawn Butler Knocked out in first round with .% For full breakdown of results click here.

The new leader of the opposition has already appointed to the top roles with a massive promition for leadership rival Lisa Nandy to Foreign Secretary.There were big jobs too for relative newcomers Anneliese Dodds and Nick Thomas-Symonds who become Shadow Chancellor and Shadow Home Secretary respectively.Corbyn allies Ian Lavery, Barry Gardiner and Jon Trickett were out while there was a concession to the right of the party with the appointment of Rachel Reeves to face off with Michael Gove as shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.Angela Rayner, who won the deputy leadership contest, was made party chairwoman, while Jon Ashworth remains Shadow Health Secretary. But itaposs not yet clearleadership runner up Rebecca Long-Bailey will get a role with the reshuffle continuing tomorrow.Starmer, who has promised to recruit a erse team from across the country and party who want to serve towards the future aim of winning that next general election , is expected to announce the new shadow cabinet today. Sir Keir secured % of the , votes cast in the three-month contest - beating his rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy to replace Jeremy Corbyn. I will have in my shadow cabinet those that want to serve towards the future aim of winning that next general election, he told BBC Oneaposs The Andrew Marr Show. It will be a talented, balanced shadow cabinet.:Thats it - for nowKeir Starmer has announced the names for the main roles within the shadow cabinet but there are plenty more places to fill. Tomorrow we#xre expecting to hear more. Keep an eye on Rebecca Long-Bailey - Keir#xs rival for the top job. If he keeps her it#xs an olive branch to the left andhe sacks her, or gives her a much more junior role it suggests he will be more ruthless than the castlist so far suggests. Others to look out for include Dr Rosena Allin-Khan who came from a very low base to come second in the deputy leadership contest, Yvette Cooper, Hilary Benn and other strong players who have been on the backbenches for the last few years. :The MPs will form Labours C- CommitteeThe MPs announced today form Labour#xs C- Committee, responsible for coordinating the party#xs response to the coronavirus crisis. Mr Starmer said: #xCWe are living through a national emergency.#xCUnder my leadership, the Labour Party will always act in the country#xs interest to save lives and protect livelihoods.#xCThat will be the number one priority of my Shadow Cabinet.#xCWe will be a responsible opposition that supports the Government where we believe they are right and challenge them when we believe mistakes are being made.#xD:Nick Brown has been re-appointed Chief WhipThis seems like another sensible appointment. Nick Brown has managed to keep the show on the road in what it seems fair to say has been a turbulent few years for Labour. Discipline may be less of a problem going forward but it#xs always helpful to have someone who knows how to #xCwhip#xD the votesneeded.Shadow Chief Whip Nick Brown :Jonathan Ashworth keeps healthApart from an awkward slip up when he was caught on tape criticising Jeremy Corbyn during the election, Ashworth has by all accounts done a good job at health. He#xs been a fairly solid performer both in parliament and in the media and has proved himself during the coronavirus pandemic. It certainly seems logical to keep him in place at the moment. Matt Hancock has praised his opposite number and even admitted changing government policy because of Ashworth#xs scrutiny. He is a close ally of Angela Rayner and would probably be classed as soft left.Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Secretary of State for Health :Rachel Reeves becomes Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterSeen as on the right of the party, Reeves is popular with MPs and many have called for her to have a big role. Starmer plumping for the more left wing Dodds as Shadow Chancellor but still keeping Reeves in a big role suggests he is trying to reach out across the party. It will take someone with Reeve#xs experienceto face Michael Gove at the despatch box. :Home Secretary to Nick Thomas-SymondsBig boost for Thomas-Symonds who has been a quietly confident player as shadow secretary general and had gone head-to-head with ebullient Tory Geoffrey Cox. He said he was #xChonoured#xD by the appointment. The lawyer said in a tweet that the #xCimmediate task is to focus on the coronavirus crisis#xD and promised to #xCwork constructively with the Government, not scoring political points, but also asking the dficult questions needed#xD.Home Secretary Priti Patel responded to him saying: #xCMany congratulations to Nick on being appointed as Shadow Home Secretary. I hope we can work together at this time of critical national importance - I have asked my team to get touch.#xDNick Thomas-Symonds :Lisa Nandy becomes Foreign SecretaryIt is always regarded as the job you give to your biggest rival. See Barack Obama to Hilary Clinton, Gordon Brown to David Miliband - in theory so they can spend most of their time out of the country, although not so much in the shadow cabinet. It#xs a massive promotion for Lisa Nandy whose biggest job to date has been shadow climate change. But she did well in the leadership campaign keeping her rivals on her toes and suggesting she might want to try again.She tweeted saying: #xCIt#xs a real honour to be tasked with leading Labour#xs foreign policy response in these dficult times. Thank you Keir Starmer for the opportunity to serve.#xD Lisa Nandy :Huge promotion for Anneliese Dodds as Shadow ChancellorFormer MEP Anneliese Dodds has been given a huge promotion to become Shadow Chancellor. :Newly elected Deputy Angela Rayner appointed as Chair of the Labour PartyAngela Rayner, Deputy Leader and Chair of the Labour Party :Diane Abbott had already announced she was stepping downDiane Abbott confirmed yesterday that she was standing down as shadow Home Secretary. Ms Abbott vacated the role ahead of being asked to do so. She tweeted: #xCAs I previously announced, today I step down as Shadow Home Secretary. I want to thank all those members and affiliates, all the NGOs and stakeholders, and my loyal staff for all their wonderful support - and to pay a special tribute to Bell Ribeiro Addy. The struggle continues.#xD Bell Ribeiro-Addy worked for Diane Abbott before going on to be elected as the MP for Streatham. Shadow Home Secretary is a key role - even more so for Labour - who have struggled over the competing issues of security and civil liberties. Diane Abbott :Jon Trickett latest Corbyn ally to goJon Trickett is the latest to the leave the shadow cabinet having served as shadow cabinet office minister under Jeremy Corbyn. He had backed Rebecca Long Bailey for the leadership. He tweeted: #xCKeir has politely asked me to stand down from shadow cabinet. I wish him and the new team well. I reaffirm my commitment to the cause of working class emancipation and to the North. The struggle continues.#xD:Party chair Ian Lavery next to goIan Lavery has said it was an #xChonour and a privilege#xD to have been chair of the Labour Party as he announced that he was out of the job. The staunch Corbyn ally wished #xCsolidarity#xD to the new leadership and incoming shadow cabinet but although there had been a change at the top there can be #xCno turning back the clock#xD. :Barry Gardiner first to announce hes goneThe Shadow International Secretary said he had been #xCstood down#xD by the new Labour leader.

The starting salary for a nurse will be £, in  . Nurses suffered like the rest of the public sector from the coalition then Tory governmentaposs pay freeze with lasted from - and then % pay cap for the next five years. They finally secured a pay rise in  with a rise of .% agreed. But may say it is a paltry amount compared to the work they do. Nursing has lagged behind other NHS staff groups over the past decade, with the workforce growing by just .% between November  and November , compared with .% for hospital doctors, for example. On Friday chief nurse Ruth May paid tribute to two of her colleagues Aimee OaposRourke, , and Areema Nasreen, , who died from coronavirus after treating patients and warned that there were likely to be more.Presenter Andrew Marr told Mr Hancock nurses are paid around £, a year at the moment, asking the Health Secretary: do you think as a result of this experience they deserve to be paid more in the future He replied: Well, look, everybody wants to support our nurses right now and I’m sure that there will be a time to debate things like that.At the moment the thing that we’re working on is how to get through this. And so you know I’m very sympathetic to that argument, but now is not the moment to enter into a pay negotiation. Now is the moment for everybody to be doing their very best. But appearing on the same programme, the new Labour leader Keir Starmer insisted that the NHS needed more money and that many of those who have been vital during the crisis deserve to be paid much better.He said the pandemic had exposed who the key workers really are and they very often have been overlooked, underpaid and there’s going to be a change. They were last and now they’ve got to be first. He added that the NHS desperately needed more investment. He said: We’ve got to look at funding. The NHS has struggled for funding over the last ten years, so that’s got to be looked at and we have to think about how we reimagine the economy going forward.Mr Starmer warned against responding to the huge public spending to tackle coronavirus with another decade of devastating austerity.We don’t know what the final figures will be but what we can’t do is simply make the mistake that we made in  and go for another decade of austerity. We’ve seen what that has done to the country, we cannot go down that route. The new Labour leader said we canapost go back to business as usual after the pandemic.He said: I think it is inevitable that we have to ask those that have more to pay more.The truth is at the moment we don’t yet know how big this challenge is going to be until we’re through this crisis, but when we are through there’s going to have to be a reckoning. We’re going to have to do things dferently. We’re going to have to build a better future.

But he did not hesitate to join , retired NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline. After  years saving lives, Dr Saadu, , lost his own last week at London’s Whittington Hospital after contracting Covid-. The surgeon’s son described his dad as a “living legend”. And that is true of all those putting their lives on the line to tend to the sick and dying. All are living legends. They battle an invisible invader with too little testing of their own health and not enough personal protection equipment to keep them safe. Their willingness to cobble together kit from whatever they can find is inspiring, shaming and humbling in equal measure. Inspiring, because it shows what can be achieved in adversity. Shaming, because, as a rich nation, we should have done more for them. Humbling, because they carry on regardless. Dr Saadu was not the first medic to die of this nasty, creeping disease. And tragically he will not be the last. Behind doctors, nurses and paramedics, a whole army of NHS workers are also toiling round the clock. The hospital porters, cleaners and caterers, the drivers, the volunteers, the maintenance and admin staff. Alongside them are the key workers who keep our nation ticking over in these perilous times – the shelf-stackers and shop assistants, the posties, truckers, delivery drivers, refuse collectors and utility workers. And the , selfless helpers who stepped forward to ensure the old and vulnerable are not forgotten. Thursday, pm, is proving itself a moving moment as a grateful nation unites to honour them. We reach out to each other in the only way social distancing allows – by putting our hands together. The response of our country to this calamity has been truly astounding. Even those twiddling their thumbs at home are doing their bit by staying there.  Astounding, too, is the response from Somerset Capital Management, the investment firm founded by House of Commons lounge lizard Jacob Rees-Mogg. While Britain has all eyes on a multiplying virus, these virulent fatcats can see no further than multiplying pound signs. While millions face being struck down by Covid-, SCM delights in a “once in a generation opportunity” to make millions by cashing in on the crisis. If Mr Rees-Mogg had an iota of honour, he would disown these grubby profiteers. A politician of real integrity would now sever his links with the company altogether. He may be worth millions, but in the coronavirus stakes his value falls far short of a doctor or nurse. It is their skill and dedication we rely on now to save our lives. It is their caring and compassion which will comfort those reaching the end of theirs.

I am living proof that you’re never too old to do anything. Nor is it ever too late to change your le. I was  years old when I discovered yoga. Before that I’d been living a glamorous le as cabin crew for British Airways. Travel was rare and expensive back in those days, you had to be very wealthy to fly on planes, so it was quite amazing. I loved it. But a rubbish rule back then was that, when you got married, you were no longer eligible for the job. I met my husband three years in and we went on to have two children and moved to Scotland as a family. Well, what a lestyle change! I didn’t know anybody and felt quite lonely with two small kids, so I decided to explore what was going on in the local area. There were two things – curling and yoga. Curling to me looked way too much like sweeping up, so I booked onto yoga, having no idea what it was. When the teacher turned up I was in awe. She was in her early s and just looked fantastic. She was so flexible and could do everything with ease and total vitality. I thought, ‘Whatever she’s doing, it works.’ I was exhausted and stressed with the children and the move when I walked in, but when I left I felt so much lighter. I couldn’t stop thinking about how effortless my teacher made it look. I was hooked. My teacher went on to inspire me, but she was very strict. Posture had to be perfect, she discussed anatomy and physiology with us, and we were expected to really know our stuff. She was an incredible teacher. After a year I decided I wanted to be a yoga teacher. In  I started my three-year course, getting stronger with each session. Now, it wasn’t easy.  I genuinely thought I was quite flexible after all these lovely skiing and surfing lessons I’d been lucky enough to have during my time with BA, but I was stf as a board when I started my training course. Now I know that’s been an advantage in my career –I can do it, anyone can. My first class was a complete accident and I wasn’t prepared. My teacher called in sick and asked me to step in. I managed to do it, but realised how dficult it was to explain things. However, after a while, when I saw some people struggling and I managed to help, I completely forgot about myself. Yoga is absolutely the best thing for your mental health, in my opinion. With all the dismal things going on around us, it teaches us to train our minds and focus on things we are grateful for and practise blue-sky thinking – things that we really want to happen. But it’s also a lot better in terms of physical exercise than people may realise. It tones, it helps joints, it strengthens your bones, helps your breathing, helps your heart and rids you of any tension. Whatever your ailment, I have a pose for it! Oryou want to come to a class and just lie on the mat, that’s fine too. It’s important to give our bodies what they need. Nowadays, yoga is very trendy, but back when I started it was known by so few. My classes became so popular that a journalist from The Daily Mirror called me up and invited me in for an interview on this new ‘craze’ back in .  From that the Mirror asked me to do a fitness video. It sold for £. and sales went through the roof! I couldn’t believe it when I was invited on morning telly to teach live yoga. My whole le changed. I’d be getting my shopping and people would say such nice things. They’d ask, ‘How did you do that one ’ and I’d give a live demonstration in the fruit and veg aisle. People are very kind, aren’t they  So I’m always happy to help. After that I went on to make  videos, which have sold millions worldwide. The most popular was The Age Free Body . I do believe that, as long as you go carefully, youthfulness is an attitude. There is no reason why those in their s and s can’t practise yoga. All you’re doing is gently working on your body and training it to a state of perfect health. It’s also judgement-free exercise, because no matter what level you do, it keeps you healthy, so it doesn’t matter what anybody  thinks. As for me, I practise yoga every day for about an hour by myself, and I am very conscious of my diet. I’ve always been fascinated by nutrition. As a war baby, all we thought about was food. Then everything was rationed until I was about aged seven, so food wasn’t consumed greedily, we just hoped we had enough to eat.  I once saw a doctor who explained that so many people on medication could be helped through pure, natural food and I tried it for a week. I’ve never changed my diet in  years. I eat fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, a little cheese, chicken, fish, milk, but skip all junk. No sweets, cakes, puddings, and instead I just eat fresh beautul food. The only sugar I have now is figs. They are rather lovely and I love a couple after dinner. I even swerve birthday cake. I know it sounds awful to say I haven’t had a slice of cake for  years, but it’s true. It’s not depriving myself, I just love my diet and how it makes me feel. I never drink alcohol. I used to have the odd glass of fizz as cabin crew and hated how it made me feel. But I feel great, quite honestly, and touch wood I’ve never been poorly. That’s not to say that diet goes hand in hand with yoga. People shouldn’t feel miserable about their bodies. You can be bigger and flexible. Often those new to exercise feel scared about taking the first step, but I make them realise that no one is perfect.  It’s lovely seeing clients encouraged when the person next to them can now do a pose they could never do. They’re always happy for each other.

Mum Stacey Smith, , forks out £ a week - or £, a year - on her daughteraposs habit, which is more than she pays in rent. But she now worried her health could suffer as supermarkets introduce buying limits. Stacey has to rely on friends and family to pick up the £. packs whenever they can as she is self-isolating with Alicia-Mae, who has a range of health problems. She said: “It really is a nightmare situation. At the minute we are okay but itaposs not going to continue forever. We donapost know how long this lockdown is going to be for.  “Thataposs my concern and what I worry about, I need to buy bulk, in case they stop stocking or limit buying further. “On a monthly basis, the price of these Dunkers costs more than my rent. Itaposs £. for a box of four, which she will easily eat before lunch. “You are looking at around  packs a day, at around £-£ a day. Itaposs around £ a week. Itaposs a lot of money and itaposs pretty much the same as my monthly house rent. She only eats the breadstick and not the cheese in each box. “Friends and family, when they go shopping, pick up the two allowed. They try to explain the situation to staff but the supermarkets donapost allow you to get anymore. “People have commented that aposIf she is hungry she will eatapos but she has had a number of health problems since she was born. Alicia-Mae, of Worcester, suffered from gastroschisis at birth - a bowel condition in newborn babies. She was also diagnosed with visual impairment at six-months-old, autism at two and then liquid on the brain at four, which required a shunt to clear the fluid.  It puts her at risk of contracting coronavirus, meaning mum Stacey has to self-isolate to protect her daughter. Stacey, who is separated from Alicia-Maeaposs dad but lives with her partner, added: “Friends and family do go out and try to help us. However, theyaposve got their own kids, so itaposs a case of them grabbing packs whenever they can. “Everybodyaposs in the same situation. Some people arenapost even leaving their house and trying to get deliveries online, so it is really concerning. Full-time mum Stacey said that the issues around Alicia’s eating started at around -months-old when they tried to move her onto solid foods. She said: We were doing the pureed veg when she was a baby, which she was absolutely fine with. “But when we moved onto solids, she started to gag and refused to eat it at weaning age, which is  months. She would even headbutt the wall. “The dietician told us to try dry food and let her feed herself, with the breadsticks being the only thing she stuck too. “For a week or two, she really liked sweet potatoes but then couldnapost eat those.  “Anything and everything we piled on her plate, carrot sticks, vegetables, she wouldnapost have. It would all get thrown to the side. “She doesnapost have crisps, chocolate, cake, ice cream, so itaposs not like she solely eats bad food. “The dietician has said to leave her without food for daysshe refuses to eat anything . She has gone three days without eating before. “She doesnapost eat the cheese so she doesnapost get her calcium fix. People comment on her size, but she has been on steroids for her conditions. “She has vitamin drops so we can keep her healthy. “Her hair, skin, nails are all fine. Alicia is bigger than average, but she has the same condition as Harvey Price. “People can be so ignorant and have been saying nasty things about my child.

One mum decided to use the days at home as an opportunity to finally decorate the bathroom she hated in her three-bedroom home in Swinton, Greater Manchester. But there was a catch, her partner challenged her to transform the space for under £.Bargin hunter Clare Dore, , accepted the task and has revealed how she managed to do up the bathroom for just £ during the coronavirus lockdown. The savvy mum-of-three bought everything to decorate the room from BM Bargains before social isolation orders came into force earlier this month - painting the walls and tiles and even using gold marker pen to spruce up the grouting.Her partner Tony, , was gobsmacked when he saw the final result. And daughters Sienna, , Destiny, four, and two-year-old Avaya all love the new green and gold-themed space too. Clare said: Before my bathroom was  years old and I hated it. I really wanted to revamp it but we had planned to move house in the next year or so, so Tony said it didnapost make sense to spend the money. I challenged him to let me do itI could do it for less of the cost weaposd spend on a family meal out at the weekend - around £ or £. In the end, everything came in at just £ - and Tony couldnapost believe it when he saw it.  She added: I wouldnapost let him see it until it was completely finished and he was gobsmacked. Heaposs not a bargain hunter like I am so he was amazed at how little it had cost to transform. Clare started the decorating by painting the white walls in a deep teal shade, which cost £ for a large tin, before painting the floor in £. white paint. She then used gold spray paint which cost £. to make the silver ider between the wall and the tiles gold and a cheap £ gold permanent marker to go over the grouting.

Despite high visitor numbers to parks and beaches suggesting fatigue may be setting in, Brits have been warned to be ready to hunker down for the long haul, as cases of the deadly bug could keep rising for another two to three weeks. Despite hopes that drastic social distancing measures will soon flatten the curve of the Covid- pandemic, Professor Paul Cosford, Public Health Englandaposs Medical Director, has warned that lockdown measures are nowhere near ending. Other experts, however, such as government adviser Professor Graham Medley of Imperial College London have argued that prolonged periods of lockdown could cause more harm than coronavirus itself, leading to soaring unemployment, food poverty, domestic violence and mental illness. So how long is it likely to last and who will decide when and how to end the restrictions  Follow the latest coronavirus updates here  When will the UK end lockdown  It is not yet clear when the UK will be able to lt its strict social distancing and lockdown measures. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to review the measures for the first time next week, however when asked about an exit strategy at the daily press conference on Saturday, Michael Gove said: Thereaposs no fixed point, no specic date in the calendar at which we can say things will change, we are keeping them under review. One key government doctor has said some measures may be in place for up to six months. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer, said of the rules last week: Three weeks for review, two or three months to seeweaposve really squashed it, but three to six months, ideally, but lots of uncertainty in that but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal and it is plausible it could go further than that. This is not to say we would be in complete lockdown for six months, but as a nation we have to be really, really responsible and keep doing what weaposre all doing until weaposre sure we can gradually start lting ious interventions which are likely to be spaced - based on the science and our data - until we gradually come back to a normal way of living. What needs to happen before the lockdown can end  Ministers and scientists have been reluctant to say what requirements must be met before they relax the rules and are still emphasising the importance of social distancing. Business Secretary Alok Sharma has warned there could be another rise in casesthe measures are lted too quickly. He told a press conference on Wednesday: Whataposs also really important is thatwe stop these too quickly, there is a possibility that that massive effort people have made across the country is wasted and we could potentially see a dangerous second peak. We absolutely want to avoid that. One scientist has suggested that mobile phone data could help lt social distancing quicker by speeding up contact tracing. Prof Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: A combination of some social distancing measures, extensive testing and automated contact tracing could allow both a more regular social activity and a signicant control of the outbreak.  Who gets to decide when it ends  The decision to end lockdown in the UK will be made by the Government alongside scientists and doctors. When the measures were put in place last month, the Prime Minister said they would be reviewed every three weeks. Top NHS doctor Professor Stephen Powis said scientists are still focusing on learning how the illness works. He said on Saturday: It is very likely that this virus will become established in populations throughout the world and so we need a strategy to manage this over time, not just in the next few weeks or the next few months. Scientic knowledge about this virus is still being discovered. As we learn more about it, as the scientic evidence builds, that will allow those strategies to evolve. Professor Graham Medley, who is advising the government, has told The Times the shutdown is merely buying time and there is no clear exit strategy from the Covid- crisis. He said: This disease is so nasty that we had to suppress it completely. Then weaposve kind of painted ourselves into a corner, because then the question will be, what do we do now  We will have done three weeks of this lockdown, so thereaposs a big decision coming up on April . In broad terms are we going to continue to harm children to protect vulnerable people, or not  "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus young man licked fingers","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Young man licked his fingers and rubbed them onto food in LidlDorset Police have charged the -year-old suspect, who is said to have contaminated goods at the Lidl branch in Bridport on Friday afternoonShareByBradley JollyDigital journalist:,  APR NewsThe offence allegedly happened at an Lidl in Bridport, Dorset\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Jake Savoie shared his thoughts on Facebook alongside a selfie taken while wearing personal protective equipment at work.He said he did not want to write a similar post, but he could not stay quiet after the stretch of nights that I just had at work. The nurse added: Seeing the amount of people who still aren’t taking this seriously is upsetting. The Facebook post reads: In the weeks leading up to this virus finally reaching our area, I read a lot of articles  viral posts warning me of the physical demands that this outbreak would place on me as an ICU nurse. I mentally prepared myself for the layers upon layers of PPE that I would be wearing, the profuse amount of sweating that I would be doing, etc...however, I was not prepared for the intense emotions that I’d be experiencing. He added coronavirus patients have no normal human interaction in the hospital until they finally test negative. Jake said: The PPE you see in my picture is just a glimpse of what a suspected positive COVID patient sees at all hours of the day night whenever ANYONE is required to enter their room . These patients have no normal human interaction from the moment they step inside the hospital until they are officially declared negative, until the virus has run its course, or until they sadly take their last breath. My heart broke more  more each time that I’d walk into a patient’s room and see the fear in their eyes. Think about this the next time you consider going out because you are tired of your only human interaction being through FaceTime or with those in your household. The nurse added a very dficult part of his job is to tell patients sad news - for example when they have to be placed on a ventilator - especially because medical workers are often the only support people who tested positive for the virus have, since their family cannot be close to them. He wrote: Once again, they receive this frightening news ALONE  their only source of comfort emotional support is from myself, another nurse, physician, respiratory therapist, or CNA dressed in full PPE. One of the most dficult things I’ve ever done as a nurse is tell a grown adult with tears in my eyes that the moment they feared most has come - ...very soon you will see me  a doctor enter your room with even more protective gear to place you on a ventilator, but I will be with you the whole time...just pretend that I’m one of your own children holding your hand.  Sharing the emotional thoughts, Jake also urged people to stay at home in order to fight the spread of the virus. He said: Think about this the next time you decide to invite a group of people over because you’re bored  lonely. These patients aren’t the only ones affected during all of this. Their family members are at home constantly wonderingthey’re safe, taken care of, afraid, comfortable... their hair is brushed the way it usually is... they are sleeping with two pillows the way that they usually do... they have someone to pray with before eating supper like they usually do at home. Their nurses doctors RTs CNAs entire care team are feeling defeated because they want so badly to help but we’ve exhausted all treatment options, medications  ventilator settings. Think about this the next time you decide to ignore elected officials’ warnings advisories because “this is all a political stunt”.  My coworkers  I are exhausted, traumatized, and scared, but we are a team of rockstars  we will push through this public heath crisis. We will fight for our patients every single day no matter the circumstance, but please don’t make it harder for us to fight by going places  gathering with other people when it’s NOT essential to do so. Jake concluded: Stay home, encourage your loved ones to to stay home, hold each other accountable, and pray for everyone on the frontlines of this pandemic. Many people shared their appreciation for the work that Jake and all his fellow medical workers are doing during the pandemic. One person commented: Jake, you and your colleagues are all heroes. Thank you for all that you do. Stay safe for your family. Respect.  Another one said: Your words should be read aloud. They bring home the reality of the situation that you  our other NHS health workers face. Iaposm sad that the human race can be so selfish  humbled by so many wonderful things that are happening during these unprecedented times. One person wrote: This made me cry. One of my best friends is a critical care nurse here in the UK, she’s my personal hero. Thank you for everything you and your colleagues are doing, you are all incredibly strong.

We went on tour for three weeks to Australia, New Zealand and Tonga etc, and a lot of the time it was just me and her – you have back-to-back engagements, a lot of dferent looks and a full-on schedule, so you become very close in that period.

It lists her job description as Princess of the United Kingdom. But this left many fans scratching their heads, wondering why it said princess when Meghanaposs official title is Duchess. While she was given the title the Duchess of Sussex by the Queen on her wedding day, she is also technically a princess, just not in her own name. She is Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Wales through her husband, Harry. The Duchess of Cambridge also listed princess under the job section part of the form on Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louisaposs birth certicates. Some fans were also surprised to see that the name was listed as Rachel, with many unaware that this is her real name.  But her parents Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland have called her Meghan since birth, and all her of her friends use it rather than Rachel. It was also the name of her popular character in her hit legal drama Suits. Harry is also listed under his real name - Henry - on Archieaposs birth certicate. The document also revealed where Archie was born, despite Meghan and Harry hoping to keep the information private.  The Duchess gave birth at the private Portland Hospital in Westminster - which costs about £,. Portland is a celebrity favourite when it comes to maternity hospitals, with a whole list of A-list patients on the books.

Striking common ground with millions who have been forced to stay at home - away from family and friends - the Queen recalled her very first broadcast to the nation as a -year-old on October , . In a radio address during Childrenaposs Hour on the BBC, the then Princess Elizabeth alongside her sister Princess Margaret, addressed children living away from home because of World War II. Once again speaking from Windsor Castle in a moment of national crisis, Her Majesty said: “While we have faced challenges before, this one is dferent. “This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. Her historic address came just hours after Britain’s coronavirus death toll rose  in a day to , - including  patients with no underlying health conditions. Follow our live blog here for all updates on coronavirus Health Secretary Matt Hancock blasted sunbathers for breaking lockdown rules, warning a total ban on all forms of outdoor exercisea “small minority” refuse to stay at home and New Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer claimed “serious mistakes” have been made by the government during the crisis. But in a message of defiance to the disease, the Queen implored the country to consider how future generations will look back and admire the response of this generation for being as strong as any. In the rousing speech which aired on television and radio last night at pm, stirring emotion throughout the land, she said: “We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us. “We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will : we will be with our friends again we will be with our families again we will meet again.” Expectation had been growing about when the head of state would make a public statement about the unprecedented events that have seen the country go into lockdown to combat the Covid- pandemic - which has struck her son Prince Charles and the Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Palace sources said the Queen has always “stood ready” to speak to the country, but “only when the time was right to do so”. Drawing on her own experience as a child before assuming the role of mother to the nation, the monarch said: “It reminds me of the very first broadcast I made, in , helped by my sister. “We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety. “Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones. “But now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do.” Described by sources as the “Government’s trump card”, the Queen last nightdelivered her upbeat message by praising the actions of millions of Brits sticking to rules to stay at home, helping protect the NHS and save lives. She said: “I also want to thank those of you who are staying at home, thereby helping to protect the vulnerable and sparing many families the pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones.  “Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you thatwe remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it. “I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. “And those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. “That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country. “The pride in who we are is not a part of our past, it defines our present and our future. In just the fth time she has addressed the British people as Queen outside of her Christmas broadcasts - the monarch went on to thank the selfless actions of medical staff risking their lives every day.  She said: “I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time. “A time of disruption in the le of our country: a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial dficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all. “I want to thank everyone on the NHS front line, as well as care workers and those carrying out essential roles, who selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of us all. “I am sure the nation will join me in assuring you that what you do is appreciated and every hour of your hard work brings us closer to ato more normal times.” Total infections leapt by , to ,, a rise of % as officials warned people to stay at home despite a bout of good weather expected this week. In face of a surge of cases expected in the coming days the Queen chose to draw strength from the outpouring of love and affection for NHS staff and key workers across the country. Q: Will my pension be affected  A: It depends what type of pension you’re paying into, how far off retirement you are, oryou have already retired. As a general rule of thumb, the longer you are from retiring, the less reason there is to be concerned. Q: I’ve got a private pension and am a few months off retiring  A: The closer you get to retiring, the more of your pot your pension provider will sht from equitiesinto other assets, such as cash. Doing so will limit the impact of the slump should you opt for an annuity – an insurance policy that pays out in retirement. Q: I’m retired and I opted for a drawdown pension. How am I affected  A: Drawdowns allow you to flexibly take cash out of your pension pot as and when you want. But your funds remain invested and, therefore, at the mercy of stock markets, so can go down as well as up. Q: I’m in a defined benefit pension, including a final salary scheme, will I be affected  A: Unlikely. While the share slump could well hit the fund you’re in, it’s the responsibility of the firm that’s behind it. As long as the firm – or “sponsor” – is doing OK, you’ll be fine. The show of respect has culminated in the nation clapping in unison on Thursday nights and homes up and down the country being adorned with children’s drawings of rainbows. The Queen added: “The moments when the United Kingdom has come together to applaud its care and essential workers will be remembered as an expression of our national spirit and its symbol will be the rainbows drawn by children. “Across the Commonwealth and around the world, we have seen heart-warming stories of people coming together to help others, be it through delivering food parcels and medicines, checking on neighbours, or converting businesses to help the relief effort. “And though self-isolating may at times be hard, many people of all faiths, and of none, are discovering that it presents an opportunity to slow down, pause and reflect, in prayer or meditation.” "},{"url":null,"title":"queen shares wish after coronavirus","story":"NewsQueen shares her wish for after coronavirus in moving message to the nationThe Queen gave a moving address on coronavirus Covid- from her Windsor Castle home, speaking about how Brits have responded to the pandemicShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video queen-shares-wish-after-coronavirus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news queen-shares-wish-after-coronavirus-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

In her message, she said she believes future generations will say we were as strong as any. In the fth nation address of her reign, she said: I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country. The pride in who we are is not a part of our past, it defines our present and our future. She also spoke with pride of the two occasions Brits have come together to clap from their windows to thank NHS staff and key workers. She said: The moments when the United Kingdom has come together to applaud its care and essential workers will be remembered as an expression of our national spirit and its symbol will be the rainbows drawn by children.  Across the Commonwealth and around the world, we have seen heart-warming stories of people coming together to help others, be it through delivering food parcels and medicines, checking on neighbours, or converting businesses to help the relief effort. People up and down the country tuned in to watch the pre-recorded message, which was filmed in the White Drawing Room of Windsor Castle. She moved to the castle last month as the outbreak began to grip the country, and is now living there with her husband Prince Philip. Her son Prince Charles has tested positive for the virus, but has now had the all clear from doctors. She wore a green dress with a turquoise and diamond brooch for the historical moment.  She began her message by thanking the NHS and key workers who have risked catching the virus themselves by going to work to help others. She said: I want to thank everyone on the NHS front line, as well as care workers and those carrying out essential roles, who selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of us all. I am sure the nation will join me in assuring you that what you do is appreciated and every hour of your hard work brings us closer to ato more normal times.

In the apology, broadcast on Sky News today, Catherine Calderwood acknowledged she had no excuses and assured the public would aposnot happen againapos. She admitted she made a mistake and let people down and cannot justy it.I did not follow the advice I am giving to others, and I am truly sorry for that, she said. Iaposve seen a lot of comments from members of the public on Twitter today, people calling me a hypocrite, people telling me about the hardships they have endured while following my guidance.I want people to know that I have seen all of that, and I have heard the comments. What I did was wrong. Iaposm very sorry.Dr Calderwood said her office had also received emails from members of the public making clear their disappointment and unhappiness. The CMO said it was important to be clear she had been at her home in Fe last weekend as well as the weekend just gone. Addressing Dr Calderwoodaposs trip to her second home, Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: The chief medical officer made a mistake in travelling away from her home. Whatever her reasons for doing so it was wrong and she knows that.  She added: All of us, including me, will make mistakes in these unprecedented times we are living in. When we do we must be candid about it and learn from it. She said the CMO is learning from her error, and added: Over the past few weeks, as we have been dealing with this crisis, her advice and expertise has been invaluable to me. She added that not withstanding her mistake on this, she is doing extremely well.  This morning Dr Calderwood issued a written apology. The statement was released after photos picturing her, with her family, near a coastal retreat in Earlsferry, were published in The Scottish Sun on Saturday. The Prime Minister said she had not known about Dr Calderwoodaposs visits to Fe until recently. Despite facing calls from some politicians to stand down, she plans to stay in her post. She had spoken with Ms Sturgeon about her wrongdoing, she said, and would continue to focus entirely on her job advising ministers over the outbreak.  I know how important this advice is and I do not want my mistake to distract from that, she added. I have a job to do as chief medical officer to provide advice to ministers on the path of this virus and to support the medical profession as they work night and day to save lives. I donapost want to make the jobs of the police, or my NHS colleagues, any harder - and I apologise to them as well. Dr Calderwood has however announced she is withdrawing from daily media briefings during the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement after Sundayaposs briefing, Ms Sturgeon said: I am acutely aware of the importance of public trust in the advice the Government is giving to stay at home in order to save lives and protect our NHS.  To maintain that trust we will be revising our public information campaign and the chief medical officer will be withdrawing from media briefings for the foreseeable future. She will continue to provide the Scottish Government with the scientic and medical advice on the spread of coronavirus. Ms Sturgeon said Dr Calderwood had offered to do whatever is in the best interest of the country. The First Minister added: In my view, that would not be her resignation. Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said officers had visited Dr Calderwood and issued a warning about her conduct. In a statement, Livingstone said the chief medic had accepted the officersapos warnings and advice.  The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone, he said. Social distancing is the key intervention to curtail the spread of coronavirus and it is essential that the instructions are followed to protect each other, take strain from the NHS and save lives.

Oxfordshire County Council has confirmed that a temporary mortuary is being set up at the former RAF base to deal with the Covid- pandemic. The worker, who asked to remain anonymous, said: Two hangars have been done already and two more are on the way, with  bodies per hangar.  It is for storage for bodies infected with coronavirus and theyaposll be in body bags and laid on the shelves. It is strange working there, everyone is keeping their distance and wearing masks.

Undertakers and NHS staff are refusing to touch the bodies so they have got the military in, whoaposll be taking the bodies in rental vans. There are quite a few rows of Enterprise rental vans there.

The Grade II listed property located on Lynmouth sea front in North Devon had previously been listed at a guide price of £, - but failed to sell at an auction in Mayfair back in February. The manor house was purchased at an online auction yesterday - the first ever held by Charles Darrow Network Auctions.The property, sitting in . acres of land and with views over the Bristol channel and Lynmouth beach, comes with four self-contained apartments, Devon Live reports.Charles Darrow director Paul Heather said it was not yet clear what the new leaseholder planned to do with the property. The buildings are owned by Lynton and Lynmouth Town Council, to whom the ground rent of £, a year is payable. Previous leaseholder, Carol Bolton, who had the property for the past four years and carried out a lot of work, said the manor house is in an incredible position. She said she bought the property just over four years ago, adding: It was a bit of a rush job because I discovered the property with just six days to go until the auction. There wasnapost a lot of time to do a lot of thinking and planning and getting surveys and the like, but I fell madly in love with the place - itaposs in such an incredible position. I went to the auction thinking that some of the big boys from London are going to arrive and bid me out of the water, but amazingly everyone stopped waving before I did, so here I am at the Manor. Carol said the first job she had to do after acquiring the property and adjoining cottages was to fix the roof on the manor.  She said: We had no choice in this - the first day it rained after we moved in we found  leaks. We then decided to renovate the cottages so we could rent them out.  They werenapost exactly derelict but they were in pretty poor condition. They were in need of a little TLC and some had floors that went up at strange  degree angles - it was a bit interesting. Speaking about the auction, Mr Heather said: We were scheduled to hold a ballroom auction on the nd April and had lots to be sold. Then the world fell apart. But, we still had sellers who needed to sell and so we adapted our usual model to fall in line with government guidance and deliver for our clients.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email The average mum and dad are finding coping with a couple of children a ­serious challenge amid the coronavirus crisis.So spare a thought for Joanne and Tommy O’Rourke – who welcomed their th child just days after the lockdown started, adding to a brood aged two to . Joanne, , is getting by on five hours’ sleep a night while the  of them rattle around their four-bed semi. But she insists the lockdown has brought them closer together and is “a special time”. She said: “It’s a weird time to give birth. There are no cards up and it’s heartbreaking that relatives can only meet him on FaceTime. “But we are so grateful he’s here and healthy. Our house might seem manic to other parents but, ­lockdown or no lockdown, it’s all about following a routine. “It’s easy to let the days trickle by and sometimes we get stressed and exhausted. But we are grateful for the opportunity for ­family time and make the most of it.”  The O’Rourkes began isolating a week before the lockdown took ­effect, over fears the virus could ­affect Joanne’s pregnancy. It means kids Mitchell, , Lauren, , Joe, , Ryley, ten, a girl of ten who cannot be ­named for legal reasons, Tommy, nine, Ashlee-Dean, seven, Freddie, six, Danny, three, and Neave, two, have been stuck in their home in Barnet, North London, for three weeks.  Joanne, a hairdresser, said: “The older ones struggled with the loss of freedom but understood why we were taking coronavirus seriously. “Babies could be born with all sorts of conditions and we were worried about extra risk.”  In the final weeks of her pregnancy, Joanne ­had midwe ­appointments at her GP surgery, where a “one in, one out” policy was adopted. Joanne was induced at Barnet Hospital on March  and their boy weighed in at lb oz the next day. She said: “Thankfully, Tommy was with me for his arrival and the staff were amazing. Though he had to leave soon after and none of my kids could visit.”  Hours after birth, the lad was whisked to intensive care over fears that he had a twisted bowel, then he was moved to London’s Great Ormond St Hospital in an ambulance. Joanne said: “I had to follow in a taxi because of social ­distancing. It was ­terrying. I felt so helpless.”  Tests were clear but staff at Barnet Hospital kept him in for another night, in case even tighter restrictions might stop him being re­admittedthere were more issues. Mum and baby have now been home for nine days – with Joanne breastfeeding as she and Tommy, , juggle home-schooling, chores and fun with the other kids. She said: “We get up at am and have breakfast followed by ­schoolwork on tablets or activity worksheets. After lunch, it’s ­leisure time – building dens, baking, football or ­painting pictures for the new NHS Nightingale hospital.  They go to their rooms at about pm. “The three youngest are with us and the others ­mostly in bunk beds.  “Lots of people would be ­negative and ask how they get enough inidual attention, and that it’s ­irresponsible. But when you see them they are happy.” Tommy, a forklt driver at BQ, does the £ weekly shop. And one of the big annoyances of the Covid- crisis is people ­mistaking him for a stockpiler because of his overflowing trolley. He said: “It’s frustrating when we are just buying enough to feed our ­family. There are three supermarkets near us and I have to go to all three every time I shop to get what we need.” The O’Rourkes get through six pints of milk, two loaves of bread, three packs of bacon, a box of cereal, a multipack of crisps and a whole toilet roll every day. Then there are the ingredients for the fresh meals Tommy cooks – ­using school dinner kit to make big batches. Joanne does four rounds of laundry a day and each child has a household task to complete. The couple even find time to run a YouTube channel about batch cooking and post to their , Instagram and Facebook followers.Incredibly, they admit more babies are “on the cards”. Joanne said: “I’d like one more but it’s not first on the agenda, especially in these times. Maybe when things go back to normal. We want to enjoy the ones we have first.” While most parents battle to keep kids from squabbling, Joanne insists having a large number at home is a “good thing”. She said: “It stops them getting bored because there’s always someone for them to play with. They get on well. The older ones help out with the little ones – whether it’s playing or a bit of reading. We have days when we get stressed but that’s just parenting.”  Recalling her fears ahead of the birth, Joanne said: “I’ve never gone to full-term with my other pregnancies but this time I was six days over. “I was freaking out and begged the midwives to induce me because the quicker he’s out, the quicker we can get home and lock the doors again.” Joanne says the atmosphere at Great Ormond Street is “strange”. “I was allowed to sit with him while they tested him but there was barely anyone around. I used that first day to try to breastfeed him, which I’ve never done with my other children.” Having already named seven boys, they are struggling to decide what to call their latest.

The mercury is set to hit C in the south east, with highs of between C and C in Scotland, Wales and the north of England. It’s going to be dry with some breeze in central and eastern parts of the country, with the weather becoming warmer in the afternoon. But despite the blue skies and balmy temperatures, Brits are under strict instructions to stay indoors to slow the spread of coronavirus. Officials have been stressing that the blazing sunshine is not a valid reason to head to parks and beaches, and ahead of the weekend, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the nation that lockdown rules are an instruction and not a request. On Saturday, Lambeth Council announced that it would be closing Brockwell Park in south-east London today after it recorded more than , visitors, many of whom it claimed were flouting social distancing rules by sunbathing or gathering in large groups. Giving the latest forecast, Met Office meteorologist Steven Keats says that any remaining clouds in the sky will have cleared overnight, giving way to warm but some windy weather. “It means that Sunday we’ll be starting off with clear blue skies above much of the UK, and for the bulk of Scotland, Wales and England that’s how it will remain for most of the rest of the day,” he said. “The sunshine turns rather hazy at times, and that is as cloud pushes into the west affecting Northern Ireland primarily through the afternoon, with some splashes of rain. “Very windy in the west with gales around the coast but the winds are drawing up warm air from the south, so temperatures of - quite possible.” Next week could be even hotter, with forecasts predicting that the approaching summer could be one of the warmest on record. Temperatures could soar as high as C in the coming weeks thanks to a mass of hot air from Africa, which could last for three months. Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze added: It’s a Sunday roast with C and, after Monday showers, up to C is on the cards on Wednesday and Thursday. “Warm air is coming all the way from the north-west coast of Africa, with good sunny spells during the next week.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman moves boyfriend during lockdown","story":"NewsWoman moves in with boyfriend during lockdown - and makes unpleasant discoveryHull Live reporter Anna Riley has fast-tracked getting to know her boyfriend, after he moved in with her for the coronavirus lockdown - and it hasnt been smooth-sailingShareCommentsByAnna Riley:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video anna-riley-shares-experiences-lockdown-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news woman-moves-boyfriend-during-lockdown-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWhen you decide to move in with your partner, it’s normally something that you take into careful consideration together and something that takes a fair bit of planning and thought.But for Hull Live reporter Anna Riley and countless other couples, that momentous decision had to be made overnight when the new coronavirus lockdown rules came into force.From discarded boxers, beer bottles and bodily s - Anna has quickly found out what living with her other half is like. It comes as Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, became a reluctant relationship advisor on March  when she said that partners who live separate homes should “test the strength” of their relationship and either move in together during the lockdown period - or stay living apart. Speaking at a press briefing from  Downing Street, Dr Harries joked that she wanted to avoid starting a new career in “relationship counselling” but maintained it was vital that couples take appropriate action depending on their domestic situation.  “If youaposve two iniduals, two halves of a couple, currently in separate households, ideally they should stay in those households, she said, but commented that the alternative to this arrangement should be to “decideone wants to be a permanent resident of another household. So Anna and her boyfriend, who have been together for coming up to eight months after meeting on the dating app Bumble, decided to take the plunge to move in together so that we could still see each other during lockdown.Here, she describes how it is going....It made sense for him to live with me as I’ve got my cats to look after that I couldn’t leave and my place is a bit bigger so we would both have a bit more space, too.An incessant amount of alarms So the first thing that I noticed was the incessant amount of alarms that he sets on a morning. My boyfriend gets up early for work as a joiner and construction worker. He’s still having to go in to work in the week, so there’s no full lockdown for him. But for some reason feels the need to set what feels like a million alarms starting from before am even though he doesn’t need leave mine until .am. He literally rolls out of bed and into his work gear without even taking the time to brush his teeth so why there is a need to set so many alarms and fall back asleep in between them is beyond me. According to him though, he’s compromised as he says at home he normally fires off seven alarms at and sets a light to come on from .am so says I shouldn’t complain.Clothes on floor Another thing that I’ve noticed is that the wardrobe seems to be an alien concept for him.   My bedroom floor soon became littered with pants, socks, shorts and tops all for the “clothing fairy” to magically pick up and put away or chuck on the washing basket.  And speaking of the clothes, I was shocked about how ratty the majority of them are as he’s normally dressed nicely for our dates or in jeans when we meet up. Whilst I was unpacking his clothes to properly put awayI also had to throw out multiple socks with holes in them that were beyond repair. Ratty shirts on the washing line and boxers on the floor are now a familiar sight. Plus the amount of tops and shorts with rips and tears in them that I discovered were seamlessly never ending. His “lounge attire” was that ragged, that the other night whilst I was video-messaging friends and the camera turned to my boyfriend, one of them even asked “why is there a homeless man sitting on your sofa ”. He claims that they are for work and that he can still get “another six months out of them” – a true thrty Yorkshireman eh  Holey moley…But I donapost look that great either...  Now we have all started working from home at Hull Live, I canapost remember the last time I put proper office clothes on... let alone wore jeans. Itaposs been nothing but loungewear and then pyjamas for me, so Iaposm hardly one to give out fashion advice at the moment.The beer stash he brought with him  One major hobby of my partneraposs is drinking. That meant that when lockdown was imminent, he made sure that he had plenty of booze in stock and then proceeded to fill the house with beer when he moved in. The tower of beer, all  beers and cans of it, plus two bottles of vodka just in case he ran out. There were that many that the cat flap in the kitchen nearly got blocked by them. The kitties even found a new home for themselves at the top of the stash once it had whittled down a little and I moved it in to the dining room. On the topic of beers, I found myself having to pick up all the empties from the floor and put them in the bin, or put them in the bin even though he had left them right next to the bin on the side, but just hadn’t quite managed to throw them away all together. With the amount he drunk as well, my blue recycling bin became too full, so I had to ask my neighbour to put the remainder of empty bottles in her bin, which she kindly accepted.The hideous chair In order to get some space away from me and my constant chatter , my boyfriend brought a hideous garden chair with him and installed it in the spare room. Next came his television, which he set up on the dressing table in there for him to watch upstairs. Both have totally ruined the décor and I’m hoping that the green and blue striped monstrosity magically breaks and needs chucking in the skip.    The kitchen situation We normally take it in turns going around each other’s houses where each of us would then cook for one anotherwe weren’t going out for food or getting a takeaway. But since the move in, I’ve either been cooking or we have both been making tea. When I suggested that we make a meal plan for the week, so that we could plan all the food to get when we went shopping, he looked at me with shock and bewilderment as it was something he’s never done before. I think ready meals and takeaways were mainly in his cuisine repertoire unless I was coming over for a meal and then he would make the effort. So cooking “proper meals” every evening was something he got used to under my instruction as to how to make it. Washing up on the side Don’t get me started on the washing up either – I think again he expected the washing up fairy to clean the pots, but to be fair to him he did then start helping out a bit rather than just leaving the pots to linger on the side. He did get particularly stressed out whilst cleaning down the hob though, and askedI had a stool for him to sit on whilst he was at the sink, as he was tired of standing up. Oh yeah, and he huffed and puffed all the way through it, too. Burping and farting It seems that now my partner has moved in, he’s decided to truly make himself at home. Which includes burping and farting with abandon – who says romance is dead, eh Leaving the toilet seat up I don’t know what the thing is with some guys leaving the toilet seat up after they’ve been for a wee, but my boyfriend is one of them that does it. The other night I got up for the loo in the night, half asleep and bleary eyed and hit the porcelain and nearly hit the bottom of the toilet bowl as I sat down in the darkness.

It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.“In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis.“This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.”Hello to all of the Dundee fans from all over the globe!  We hope this update finds everyone safe and well during these unprecedented and unimaginable times.  This, I have to say, is the strangest and scariest period, certainly of my letime and it has brought to the forefront, that, despite all of our dferences , we are truly all in this together and as such, we will get through this together.We at Dundee Football Club have been constantly monitoring the situation we find ourselves in due to the COVID- virus and have been taking advice, giving guidance, and implementing protocols to keep our staff, patrons and partners safe and sound as we ensure the sustainability of the club.First of all, the club do indeed have Business Interruption Insurance with specic additions of Notiable Diseases and Prevention of Access to our Commercial Combined Insurance Policy which should allow us to have options to reimburse those losses incurred due to the cancellation of matches. It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over. So from all of us at Dundee Football Club, please stay safe, keep your families safe, that is the most important thing and know that we are all in this together and we will come through this together!"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/HEALTH-Coronavirus-15053006_35021164.jpg ","title":"dundee university involved in covid 19 testing facility","story":"The University of Dundee has helped to establish Scotland’s central Covid- testing facility in Glasgow.It was announced by the UK Government earlier this week as one of several measures to increase testing and response to the spread of Covid- across the UK.It will be opened in collaboration with the Scottish Government and industry experts from BioAscent Discovery Ltd and Dundee’s Drug Discovery Unit .The World Health Organisation has advised an intense testing regimen is one of the key ways to curb the spread of the virus.Professor David Gray, of the DDU, says the new facility will heavily assist with testing. vw, px\"  He said: “The increase of testing capabilities will undoubtedly help to save lives and ease the burden on the NHS so I was pleased to be able to bring my skills to bear on this global problem.“We are committed to doing everything we can to help the local, national and international efforts to fight Covid-.“The co-operation and determination across this and other institutions is exceptional.”The site is already designed to meet industrial scale standards and will be able to begin testing in mid-April.It will be staffed on a   basis by more than  volunteers including highly experienced molecular scientists, technicians and bioinformaticians – all with the relevant skills and experience to carry out Covid- testing.Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman said: “When it becomes operational, the centre will make a signicant dference in the fight against the Covid- pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/medw-rainbow-caroline-stephenson-2-846x564.jpg ","title":"gallery your second batch of selfie islation photos do you see anyone you know","story":"These are tough times, but amid all the doom and gloom the Tele is determined to put a smile on your face.That’s why we want you to send us your “selfie-isolating” pics!These could be photos of your home-schooling efforts, rainbows you have made to brighten up your windows, fun family activities you are taking part in or even just a pic of your favourite pet.Caroline Stephenson’s daughter Poppy, , had the idea of painting rainbows to display in her window as a symbol of hope, and dozens of you have been in touch with your own ‘selfie isolating’ pictures, many of which include rainbows.Above is a selection of some of the pictures we’ve been sent already.

Riverside was a shock for them on a December morning and certainly not what a guy like Caniggia was used to!“Caniggia, Ravanelli, Ketsbaia, all the top names that came into the club were brand new. They were great lads, they really were.“It was a bit surreal training against these boys. I was a bit stand-offish because I had a reputation of being a little rash and I wasn’t going to smash Caniggia in training!“He was just left to do his thing and you gave him the respect he deserves.“He basically got to do whatever he wanted around the club. Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place. I got injured down there in my first or second game, sat stuck in a hotel and I thought that was me done.“I was only  so I was just a bit naive and immature I guess. Getting back to enjoying the game was about  per cent luck.“I was playing for Falkirk, doing OK and enjoying it in a young team in the First Division with boys like Mark Kerr and Lee Miller.“My head was still pretty much gone from the previous couple of months. But with the Bonnetis falling out with almost all the centre-halves at Dundee bar one, I was back in.“I got on well with [former Dundee owner] Peter Marr and he liked me as a player so persuaded Ivano to bring me back.“I went back and played about six games towards the end of that season and Berti showed up to watch me put in two man-of-the-match displays.“Next minute I’m called up for Scotland.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.45753744-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.45753744-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.45753744-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.45753744-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"lee wilkie neil doncaster ian maxwell","story":"It’s been a long week of rumour and speculation since the last update we had from the SFA and the SPFL.What that radio silence hammers home most to me is a lack of leadership and decisiveness.Don’t get me wrong, I have sympathy for Ian Maxwell, Neil Doncaster  Co.This is a very complicated situation where you are unlikely to please everyone because so many doors could open up in dferent directions for clubs in terms of the current season and ongoing league structure.It melts your mind a bit when you start thinking about all the possibilities and how it could affect people but there needs to be a decision made soon.Uefa won’t do it for them, nor will Fa or English football, they need to grab the bull by the horns and show a bit of leadership.The resolution for all of this starts with them so it’s important they’re clear with their message.There’s no way they could possibly keep everybody happy but they must do something decisively and quite quickly to protect clubs and their incomes.I think most football people, myself included, would like to see the season played to a finish – eventhat is behind closed-doors.However, it’s beginning to look like we won’t see that happening at all given the current health guidelines from the UK and Scottish Governments pointing towards a longer lockdown being put in place across the country.August has been touted as the date for ato domestic football and, like I have said before, although it will be a long four months, it could be a good opportunity to restructure our gamedone correctly.It’s definitely an option and, depending on how it looks, I might even prefer that to closed-doors games.Reshuffling the leagues and increasing the number of teams will be refreshing and I think most fans would back that.Most of the clubs would be fairly happy, too, with no relegations across all four isions and promotion for the top two sides in the lower leagues.There may be some disputes about the tighter leagues and promotion play-offs but you’d like to think most would understand the extraordinary nature of the situation.Dundee would probably have been able to push Inverness right to the end and might feel a bit hard done by but it’s a really dficult one.I don’t envy the high heidyins but they’re paid to make these calls.The biggest thing that needs to be cleared up as soon as possible, for me, is the financial aspect of the shutdown.Clubs have been left in limbo by the powers that be for too long already.Many don’t have any income at all while there are still so many question marks about how they will access adequate monies from the SPFL and the SFA.It’s really important they decide what’s happening as soon as they can because clubs need to move on and plan for, what looks like, months ahead without any football.There’s so much work to do, it’s a bit of a head spinner.At this stage we’re not even taking into account the transfer window where, Dundee United in particular may be able to raise cash.I’m sure there will already have been plenty of enquiries about Lawrence Shankland.It’s probably a huge worry for a club like United. Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":null,"title":"listening service and food parcels on hand for those in need in dundee","story":"A Dundee-based community group is providing food parcels and a listening service for those in need across the city.Dundee Thegither began its seven-days-a-week service approximately two weeks ago, with the aim of making sure people are fed during the coronavirus crisis.Sheena Wellington, one of the phone handlers, said: #We#re offering support to anyone that needs it.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"a83 slip recovery work ongoing","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEssential work to make safe the area of hillside that slipped and blocked the A earlier this yearis forging ahead.Taking care to maintain social distancing and to observe all current NHS and government health advice, a team of experts has been carrying out extensive operations to stabilise the slope and construct a back-up catch-pit.Led by Forestry and Land Scotland, the team includes the geotechnical engineers and consultants involved in resilience works where on the Rest and Be Thankful, and partners Transport Scotland and BEAR.FLS Planning Manager, John Hair, said: #We’re channelling a lot of resources into this and are working on it seven days a week to make this area safe.#Over , tonnes of debris landed on the road back in January. It took a lot of clearing up but that loss of material from the hillside presented other problems as well. We’re currently underpinning a -metre stretch of the forest road to strengthen it and prevent any further major collapse.#The landslip channel has been stabilised but, in the event of future extreme weather events potentially affecting this part of the slope, we are constructing a catch pit that aims to prevent debris from reaching the road surface.#Traffic management will be in place for approximately a further two weeks to allow us to complete the catch pit. We will be working on stabilising the forest road for another four weeks after that but will not require any more traffic management.#Currently only one lane of the carriageway is in use.The area of hillside affected is land that FLS looks after but is well away both from those areas that have slipped in the past and from areas where previous mitigation work has been carried out.Engineering assessments indicate that the incident was the result of exceptionally heavy rain causing a section of hillside above the forest road to slump and block a drainage culvert. This resulted in water damming up, overflowing the forest road and reaching the downhill slope, carrying surface material downhill and also creating a channel for more water to travel down at a faster rate.John, added: #This event arose from a very particular set of circumstances that are unlikely to apply to other sites and situations. However, aware as we are of the increasing occurrence of prolonged spells of heavy rain, we have already reviewed and adapted our inspection process to include checks on other forest roads set in similar landscapes.#We are also developing climate change adaptation actions to make the forests and land more resilient and mitigate such risks.#"},{"url":null,"title":"ferry services cant stay afloat forever msp","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFerry operators are facing #signicant losses,# but cannot stay afloat forever without help, the country#s transport secretary has warned.Michael Matheson MSP has added his signature today to a letter from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments warning that some routes could sink unless there is intervention.It has been sent to UK Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps to sound the alarm bell over the future of services in places like the Western Isles.Ferry companies have faced signicant losses since the outbreak of COVID- and the crackdown on travel, restrictions on movements and some freight.Politicians are warning that ferry companies will need to make #decisions# on #loss-making routes# in coming days as carrying on with reduced passengers and staffing numbers may not be sustainable longer term.It comes as CalMac, which offers  vessels serving  routes, has revealed its passenger numbers have dropped by  per cent since new rules on essential ferry travel were put in place.The company has carried just , passengers compared to , for the same period last year, although company MD Robbie Drummond welcomed the fact the public is paying attention to government advice not to travel.The company, he said, remained committed to running #leline services# to the islands.Some of the asks of the UK government include an #immediate and temporary# relaxation of the competition regulations and a confirmation that seafaring companies will qualy for the employee support scheme.Mr Matheson said: #My officials and I have kept in touch with ports and ferry operators over the past few weeks and they have expressed substantial concerns with their operations over this dficult period.#I believe that without further intervention operators will need to take dficult commercial decisions which could be avoided, and that it will be extremely dficult to recover from that after we make it through this crisis.#Current reductions in freight traffic are also a serious issue in their own right.#There is a strong case for the UK Government to do more to support this vital sector during these unprecedented times and I look forward to their response on this important matter.#"},{"url":null,"title":"helpful advice for students during coronavirus pandemic","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhether it is worry over money, exams, or family and friends – perhaps all three – the COVID- pandemic is a stressful time for students.While many will be at home with their families, and subsequently isolated from their natural peer support, many others will be unable to leave their student accommodation or indeed, in some cases, be unable toto their home country.Student services across the country are going to great s to communicate crucial advice and support, but it is incumbent on us all to help.Through the wonders of digital connectivity, isolation does not have to mean loneliness.Now is a good time to make that phone call, send that text or private message you’ve been meaning to send.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

That could take the form of an industrial unit large enough to house the theatre rigging and studio equipment.ldquoShe and her financial partners must now consider the best way to ensure the old church building is not left to fall into disrepair and are in talks with East Lothian Council planning department considering appropriate conversion projects.ldquoSeparately, she is seeking a more appropriate space to run the dance and music school.ldquoShe hopes to find a place where drop-off and parking are easier for parents, especially in the winter months.Two of the flats would be accessed from the rear, with two upper flats accessed by the existing double doors at the front of the building."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-lockdown-rules-deemed-essential-travel---can-drive-somewhere-exercise-walk-dog","story":"Under new government guidance, people are allowed to go out once daily for exercise - but does this include driving to a beauty spot or park to run or walk your dog Here are the answers to some top questions.Can I drive to take my dog on a walk The current rules being enforced by the lockdown states that there are only four reasons you should be leaving your home:-One form of daily exercise - Shopping for essentials- Travelling to and from work- To fulfil medical needsNew government advice today addressesthe issue of driving further afield than where you live to take exercise.The guidancesays - please use the following guidance in order to stay safe:North Yorkshire Police have announced that they will be using checkpoints to stop vehicles and ask drivers where they are going.Assistant Chief Constable Mike Walker said: ldquoThe new and signicant restrictions announced by the Prime Minister on Monday evening spell out very clearly what each and every one of us must do to save lives.ldquoThe message is clear and the warning stark.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post comments.ldquoThe real challenge will be to ensure likely local residents businesses are aware and can gain access to

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

Over the last couple of days he talked of getting people back to work after Easter - a ldquobeautul timeline - at the same time as threatening to put New York, currently the worst affected state, into complete quarantine.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was relieved when the  trillion government support package his administration drew up was finally signed off. But based on what family and friends are telling us on daily calls, itrsquos going to take more than a one-off , cheque for low and middle earners for this to be anything other than a catastrophe for the worldrsquos richest country.The coronavirus trajectory is looking particularly ominous in the US, with its case rate the highest in the worldand a death rate that is already on course to outpace Italy.No country can escape the devastating effects of this virus, of course, no health service is not at risk of being overwhelmed. But as anyone who has spent signicant time there will know and understand, the US is a nation spectacularly ill-suited to a pandemic of this nature and magnitude. Even without the addition of Donald Trump.Indeed, the virus is already exposing many of US societyrsquos in-built weaknesses. Most fundamentally, the non-universal healthcare system that means millions of Americans have no way to pay for treatment should they become ill. Even those who do have medical insurance could find themselves with huge, le-ruining bills, depending on their medical history and policy exclusions. At a time like this, a complex, profit-drivensystem which links healthcare with employment status is particularly likely to fail.The notoriously ungenerous welfare system only compounds this. Many people will feel compelled to keep working rather than following instructions to stay at home. The additions to unemployment benefit announced in the support package are unlikely to provide much reassurance for those in this situation.Demographics is also key. Much of the interior of this vast country, including many of the southern states and rural areas, are poor and poorly resourced to a level that would astound many Europeans. If they are short of ventilators and hospital beds in New York, I dread to think what it will be like in rural Arkansas and Mississippi, where higher proportions of the population are elderly, infirm, unemployed and uninsured.But, as Mr Trumprsquos popularity in some of these places affirms, there are other fundamental issues at play. Many Americans distrust the very idea of the state, and their in-built inidualism may make them balk at the idea of having freedoms curtailed. They have no experience of the state having this much direct control over their lives, no experience in living memory of sacricing personal freedoms, as Europeans did during the Second World War. I note with concern that in some parts of the US there has been a rush on guns as well as toilet paper.This is also the most ided of nations, along political, geographical, economic and religious lines, which plays into a narrative of suspicion and rage. Only two weeks ago, while visiting the southern states, I spoke to people who believed coronavirus had been created by China in retaliation for US trade tarfs. Others talked of it being a plague sent by God to punish sinners.Even a well-run administration would have been up against it. As it stands, Mr Trumprsquos response, strewn with delay, contrary messages and personal insults, may already have cost lives.Despite the worry I feel for my American family, I want to end on a positive. I have no doubt the ingenuity, tenaciousness and \"can do\" attitude of people there, that other strand of the inidualism mentioned earlier, will play an important role in how the world tackles this crisis in the months ahead. On this front, I hope America continues to be the home of the brave."},{"url":null,"title":"keir-starmer-replaces-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader","story":"The current shadow Brexit secretary wasthe favourite to succeedJeremy Corbynafter winning the support of a majority of local constituency parties.He won out over other contenders: shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy.Congratulations to @Keir_Starmer, the new Leader of the Labour Party!#LabourLeadership pic iPjxXaWMfHe said: \"Itrsquos the honour and privilege of my le to be elected as Leader of the Labour Party.\"I will lead this great party into a new era, with confidence and hope, so that when the time comes, we can serve our country again ndash in government.\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said:ldquoKeir will make an outstanding leader of the Labour Party and future Prime Minister.

How  By learning another language.To be fair, thousands of people in lockdown have figured this out. A lot are dusting down old textbooks or downloading the phone app Duolingo.But can you really learn to speak \"foreign\" without leaving your house  Can your children  Can you or your family refresh or improve existing skills.: How to help your teenagers through lockdownThe short answer is yes ndash thanks to the internet and its incredible resources, especially teachers using Skype, Zoom or other video links.But there are lots of potential pitfalls. Some are specic to the lockdown. And some less so.I have made all the mistakes it is possible to make when learning. So, after taking advice from people smarter than me, here are my top tips for \"lockdown language\".Pick the right language for youFirst, a word of warning. Some people are going to have tremendously strong opinions about what you study. Sometimes they are just enthusiasts for a language or culture, say a passionate Italophile. Thatrsquos great. But remember what works for them might not work for you.Sometimes self-appointed experts focus on what they imagine is right for the country and the economy and not for you. ldquoPah, they will tell you, ldquowhy are you learning Icelandic when there are a billion-zillion Chinese and just a couple of hundred thousand Icelanders This is dumb, really dumb.My tip  Always start with a language that is relevant to you, that you know you will use ndash and therefore not lose.Soyou happen to hike up volcanoes in Iceland every summeror have a boyfriend from Reykjavik or a passion for the sagas, then why not learn to speak like our Atlantic neighbours  Butyou, for instance, do business in Shanghai, practise a bit of kung fu or are fascinated by calligraphy, then maybe think about Chinese.But it really important to \"click\" with the language you are learning. If you canrsquot make up your mind, try out some first, see what fits you.Maybe lug in to some languages before settling on just one. Watch a French or Polish movie or listen to some Italian opera or Brazilian pop, MPB. Try to mimic the sounds.Or take a sampler lesson. You can get one for as little as  an hour online. That takes me to my next top tip.Hire a real teacher or go to real classes ndash online.Remember how you learned the language yoursquore reading now  First your parents ndash probably mostly your mum ndash taught you how to speak. Then at school teachers expanded your vocabulary ndash and with it your world.Learning a language is visceral, itrsquos physical, itrsquos kenetic and itrsquos social. Itrsquos about making unfamiliar sounds with your mouth and recognising them with your ears. You need someone to correct your mistakes as you go along, just as your mum did when you were a baby. You canrsquot teach yourself. Donrsquot waste time trying.I am a big fan of group classes. This is where you learn from your mistakes ndash and those of your peers ndash and you have fun doing so.But this must be impossible when you canrsquot leave the house  Not at all. A number of big providers, private schools, have flipped online using digital tools like Zoom, with the same kit you may be using to stay in touch with friends and family ndash a phone or a laptop.Desperate schools on the European mainland ndash including really prestigious ones ndash are offering a week of intensive lessons, three hours a day in a virtual classroom, with learning materials sent by PDF, for less than the equivalent pound a week. Some are offering three weeks of tuition for  euros.Some Scottish schools, such as Lorca Spanish, are continuing their classes online ndash you canto the classroom when the bug clears.What about private lessons  These are great too, though harder work for learners and teachers. They also tend to be more expensive.However, there are websites such as Italki where language teachers are offering personalised classes for adults and children, often for as little as  an hour with taster lessons for less.:Ron McKays Diary: Lockdown advice, drugs warning and a special anniversaryGillian Campbell-Thow, the languages guru for Glasgow schools, rams this message home: \"Maintaining your oral proficiency is key and you need to talk. End of. If you canrsquot get to your class or meet up group ndash get on a  that you can see people face to face and start the conversation. Many language schools are moving to web-based lessons ndash you cannot beat having a real person to talk to. You wont get that kind of immediate help and support from an app!!Immerse yourself in your chosen languageYour home might be in Scotland ndash but it does not have to be that way.If you are an early learner why not label everything and every room in your house with post-it notes of their name in the language you are trying to pick up.Donrsquot be ashamed to talk to yourself. Vacuuming  Whatrsquos a Hoover in German  Or Urdu  Say it out loud. And not just once.Making dinner  Why not look up a recipe in the language yoursquore learning on YouTube Listening to radio as you cook  Tune in to the country where your language is spoken . Or try some of the amazing content on the catch-up services of the European equivalents of the BBC, including material designed for children or foreigners. France Culture has a whole \"pedagogical series called Nation Apprenante RAI Radio  has Italian classic novels as audiobooks Germanyrsquos Deutsche Welle has free lessons for foreigners at all levels.Binging Netflix or Amazon after dinner  Look at the language settings. You might find your favourite show comes in Spanish or French or Arabic, which subtitles to match. And there are plenty of box sets from around the world to let you put your new or old language skills to test while relaxing on your sofa.Want to socialise  You can do that at home too. Conversation groups ndash meet-ups in cafes and bars for people who want to practise their languages ndash have not shut down, they have just gone online.Yakety Yak, a Scottish business which normally arranges chats in cafes in Glasgow and Edinburgh, says its Zoom events are working well. So much so that it is thinking of continuing them after we get the all-clear.Gaming  PlayStation and other consoles have language controls so you can play in the language you are learning or refreshing.Donrsquot rely on games, apps or other gimmicks ndash but donrsquot ignore them eitherThere are some fantastic new tools for learning foreign languages. But I think they should be seen as supplementing real lessons, not replacing them.It is easy to scoff at games like Duolingo ndash an app with a green bird that has simple beginners lessons with some often surreal vocabulary.Duolingo has proved really popular in Scotland as a way of giving users some familiarity with Gaelic ndash but, of course, no in-depth knowledge. And ndash as a way of relaxing after real lessons ndash it might be worth a try.Podcasts are also no alternative to real teaching. But, my goodness, they can be a great resource. There is a small Scottish firm called Radiolingua which produces short ldquoCoffee Breakpodcast lessons in a whole iety of languages. Check them outyou are a beginner of intermediate learner.Donrsquot think of beginners level as easy and advanced as hardOK, yoursquore stuck in the house and you canrsquot go to a class. So yoursquore tempted to just teach yourself the \"basics\" of your chosen language, because they are easy, right  Wrong!Beginnerrsquos level is where so many Scottish language learners screw up.Itrsquos hard to replicate the sounds of another language. It is worth trying to get it right from the start. Otherwise, to make headway you have to unlearn all the ugly noises you have hard-wired in to your brain when you thought you were rehearsing \"easy\" basics.:Nature reminds us that this lockdown limbo wont last foreverThe good news  Advanced does not mean hard. Learning a language is a marathon, not a sprint. Like a long-distance runners, you will hit walls, but itrsquos not always easy to say when.Focus on talking and listening more than on reading and writingAnother peril of self-teaching ndash or even Scotlandrsquos traditional approach to modern languages ndash is that it ends up becoming very focused on the written word.So, especially,you are a beginner, try to work most on your oral and aural skills, rather than written screeds. Campbell-Thow says: ldquoWriting an essay isnrsquot going to get you what you want in a restaurant or get you out of trouble.This is especially true for your primary-aged kids.Keep a wee wordbookSet yourself a target of learning  words or phrases a day, jotting them down on a notepad and checking yourself every morning. Some people find it helpful to break new vocal in to themes. But keeping going over this book.Campbell-Thow adds: ldquoDonrsquot be frightened to write beside it how it sounds to you.Donrsquot worry about making mistakesThere is nothing wrong with getting something wrong. Just laugh it off. After all, saying accidentally funny things might just be what we all need in these dark times.How to teach your kids a language ndash by Gillian Campbell-ThowThe trick for language learning with wee ones is to remember how children learn their mother tongue ndash they need lots of aural exposure to language and lots of repetition. For primary-age children we need not focus on the reading and writing but lots of talking, listening and intercultural awareness.bull Start with music ndashyou can sing it, you can say it. Use music from films that wee ones might recognise such as nursery rhymes, Disney films etc ndash they already know the tune and now they need to hear a dferent meter of words. Donrsquot overthink the listening, just let them hear it and keep it on a wee loop.bull Get into watching familiar cartoons as well ndash most cartoons will be available in other languages ndash again same context just dferent languages. It doesnrsquot make it so strange.bull Use BBC Class clips for more educational input and intercultural awareness.bull Short clips are great as there is plenty of audio visual stimulus. Try and stay away from the words in the first instance ndash children will use mother tongue pronunciation rules and thatrsquos when mistakes can get embedded.bull Lots and lots of listening, talking and singing ndash so any chance there is to interact, talk and play along with others is great.Gillian Campbell-Thow is curriculum leader for Modern Languages and Gaelic, Glasgow City Council________________________________________________________Shops across Scotland are closing.

If the world hadnrsquot bolted its doors and entered coronavirus lockdown, Fynn Donaldson and more than a dozen pals, fresh from leaving school and with feet still sore from dancing at the end-of-term prom, would be on the beach by day and hitting the clubs by night.ldquoIt should be the summer of her le, says her mum, comedian and writer Jojo Sutherland. ldquoInstead, wersquore at home playing cards and board games.ldquoShe has lost her senior show, the prom, the last day of high school with her friends, her exams. They are all experiences that she will never get back things that Fynn and her friends looked forward to since day one at high school are gone, and thatrsquos hard.Across the Forth from -year-old Fynnrsquos South Queensferry home Eve Gill, , is in lockdown in Cupar, Fe, also trying not to dwell on what should have been.She has trained for a year alongside specially selected teenagers from her school, Bell Baxter High School, for what should have been a le-changing km trek across East Greenland. Instead of heading off earlier this week for the once-in-a-letime Polar Academy adventure, she is stuck inside doing  push-ups a day in an effort to stay fit and trying not to succumb to frustration and negativity.ldquoShersquos been upset and disappointed, says her mum Moy. ldquoTherersquos the anxiety of what is going to happen with her exams too.ldquoTherersquos something about the consolidation and clarity that comes with sharing a year or tworsquos work with someone other than her teachers that is not going to be there.While painting rainbows and watching Disney+ movies might get parents with young children through, lockdown for parents of teens has become a delicate balancing act of avoiding saying the wrong thing ndash impossible at the best of times ndash tiptoeing around unpredictable hormones and fighting over why they mustnrsquot go out to meet their friends.For those trying to stop stroppy older teens used to independence from leaving the house, and others fearful that their youngsters may slide into deep anxiety, stress and even depression, the added pressure of the current crisis means the stakes are even higher.The stress and anxiety of coronavirus, cancelled proms, scrapped exams and separation from friends comes against a backdrop of heart-breaking statistics that show young peoplersquos mental health is more fragile than ever.Last year, more than , young Scots needed mental health treatment from the countryrsquos  health boards: a rise of almost  since . Worryingly, more than  children and young people waited over a year to receive support through from health board mental health services.It means that for parents of teens, it is going to take a bit more effort than a Joe Wicksrsquos am workout and baking a Betty Crocker cake to get through whatrsquos ahead.At home in the shadow of the Forth Bridges, Jojorsquos daughter Fynn should have been preparing for five Highers, hoping for the right grades to study politics and international relations at either Dundee, Stirling or Aberdeen University.ldquoFynn has been emotionally down in terms of looking at the things shersquos not now going to experience, says Jojo.ldquoShe plays volleyball for Scotland and had been looking forward to going the European Championships in Iceland in June. She normally trains three or four times a week physically, shersquos like a caged animal.ldquoOne advantage is that her generation communicates online anyway. Theyrsquore doing stupid dances and messaging each other just like before and she still feels connected to her mates.Unlike smaller children who may not fully grasp the seriousness of the situation, she points out that older children canrsquot be easily distracted or fobbed off.ldquoYou canrsquot bullsh** teenagers and say everything is going to be fine. They read the papers and see the news and know whatrsquos going on.ldquoShe seems okay, but I worry because mental health problems, depression and anxiety are much more prevalent among teenagers these days.According to parenting expert Laura Erskine of The BabyDoc Club, guiding teens through this crisis needs a particularly delicate touch. ldquoThey are looking at news and social media, they are glued to their screens in their rooms and they know whatrsquos happening.ldquoWe need to get them out of their bedrooms, into a family space and find new ways to do things with them.Talking to them directly about their feelings could backfire, she warns.ldquoTeenagers donrsquot want to sit down and talk about stuff thatrsquos worrying them with their parents. They want their peer group.ldquoInstead of asking them straight about their feelings, ask about their friends or say start a conversation by saying yoursquore aware someone you know has a son or daughter thatrsquos struggling a little.ldquoTeenagers are very self-centred and believe the whole world revolves around them. But their feelings and worries are all valid.For parents of older teens, therersquos the challenge of trying to prevent headstrong young adults from wandering out to secretly meet friends.Jojo, who has three other older children, says: ldquoFynnrsquos been good, but I think a few kids in the area have been a bit naughty. Itrsquos going to happen.ldquoBut her attitude iseveryone studiously stays at home, this will pass quicker.Although they donrsquot know each other, both Fynn and Eve are taking a pragmatic approach to lockdown.Fynn hasnrsquot yet completely written off the possibility of a summer break with her pals Eve, who was due to sit seven National s, is focusing on next April when Polar Academy adventure with nine other students from her school is now due to take place.ldquoI was gutted that it was postponed, she says. ldquoBut Irsquove come to terms with it now.ldquoWersquore all being positive for each other.Case study: Le with the WilsonsCharlene Wilson, a press officer from Clackmannanshire, has teenage daughters, Cha, , and Megan, .ldquoOur girls are finding things quite tough, she says. ldquoTheyrsquore at a challenging age with their hormones affecting their emotions and are mostly struggling with not being unable to socialise.ldquoThey do chat on WhatsApp and Zoom but itrsquos not the same as having that human interaction.The prospect of missing birthday treats next month, not being able to see grandparents and family, and fears their plans to see Lewis Capaldi at Trnsmt may be scuppered, have been hard.ldquoIrsquom missing seeing my friends and even missing seeing my teachersIrsquom honest, says Cha. ldquoI feel very cut off from people which isnrsquot nice.ldquoWe are hearing the news every day about coronavirus and how more and more people are affected and dying, so that is quite upsetting.Sister Megan is also finding lockdown hard. ldquoI mainly miss seeing my friends. I get a bit worried when I hear the news and daily updates about coronavirus and I worry for my grandparents.However, mum Charlene adds: ldquoItrsquos not all doom and gloom.ldquoWe are doing more together as a family than ever before, cooking together, sharing chores and finding ways to entertain ourselves in the evenings by watching a family film, playing cards or Scrabble, and coming up with our own pop quizzes.Mental health: the warning signsAround one child in ten aged five to  has a clinically diagnosable mental health problem, with half of mental health problems established by the age of  and % by age .So how can parents spot the signs that all may not be as well as theyrsquod like According to mental health organisation SAMH, there are certain behaviours to look out for:bull Losing interest in activities that they used to enjoybull Making negative statements about themselvesbull Losing their appetite or eating too muchbull Feeling tired all the time, disturbed sleep or oversleepingbull Finding it hard to concentrate or switch offbull Feeling panicked or scared without causebull Obsessing over calories or exercisebull Missing meals or avoiding eating in front of others.Seek professional help as soon as possibleyou spot any obsessive or compulsive behaviour, unexplained cuts, bruises, burns or clusters of marks, seeing sudden, overwhelming emotions where they feel \"out of control\", oryour child expresses thoughts about hurting themselves or ending their le.Find out more at www.samh.org.ukHow to get through lockdown without losing itStroppy teenager in the house Kirsten Amis, who leads the counselling service for students at Glasgow Clyde College, says it is possible to get through lockdown without losing it.She recommends parents try to encourage teens to have a clear structure to their day, to avoid long days in bed and wearing the same pyjamas for days on end.For teens threatening to go out to see friends, she advises having an open discussion about the dangers. ldquoYou donrsquot want to scare people but you do want them to make an active decision.ldquoIf you tell them want to do, they will hear you speaking to them astheyrsquore a child.Games and fun arenrsquot just for little children, she adds. ldquoPlan a timetable of stuff to do that theyrsquoll be interested in.

The subject matter is more akin to a science-fiction movie than a mainstream news bulletin.Infection rates soaring and death rates alarmingly high millions of jobs lost as companies shut down health systems on the verge of collapse body removals on an industrial scale from New York hospitals heavily armed vigilante groups in the US prepare for a breakdown in law and order.The tremors of fear infiltrating our every sense can seem very tangible ndash but we have almost certainly gone too hastily from glass half-full to glass almost empty.I know there are few things any of us have gone through that can directly compare to what is happening right now.But with so much time to ponder and muse ndash and worry and reflect ndash I canrsquot help but think Irsquove been in the blackest of holes before only to realise some time later that things werenrsquot as bleak as I had thought they were.This time last year I quit my job as director of communications with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde after falling victim to a cruel and costly financial scam that saw me losing my le savings. .My plan was to launch my own business and work like crazy to recoup what I had lost, but there was a bend in the river I never saw coming ndash and that was being diagnosed with lung cancer two months after launching the business and just as I started to secure contracts.I also remember many years ago scribbling on a bit of paper just how wealthy Irsquod be by the time I was  and my endowment mortgage matured. And I remember once planning for a le of retirement on a sun-kissed part of the Mediterranean with my then we.Then there was the time I calculated the future eye-watering value of my shares portfolio including a windfall pile I bought as part of an employee buyout of The Herald newspaper media group.But there were unexpected bends in all those rivers too ndash the worldwide stock-market crash a orce the endowments bubble bursting.However, the absence of those dreams becoming reality simply didnrsquot dampen the years of fun and joy that happened in the interim.And when I was made redundant from the job I loved in newspapers, I discovered a new challenging career leading NHS communications for  years.After my orce I found happiness with the woman I married ndash my childhood sweetheart from Primary  at Thornliebank Primary School ndash and with whom I am in love with today.My pension lump sum on leaving the NHS sorted out my financial woes and, in hindsight, the cancer would have happened last year no matter what career decision I made.Like everyone , Irsquom worried about Covid- and how it might affect the people I love . Butthis current black hole is anything like all the others there remains something to hope for round the next bend.Ally McLaws is founder and MD of the McLaws Consultancy, a specialist in reputation enhancement and protection.Among his clients is the UKrsquos influential Association of British Credit Unions where he operates as its external strategic adviser.www.mclawsconsultancy"},{"url":null,"title":"coronvirus-comment-shouldnt-take-pandemic-show-can-end-rough-sleeping","story":"Making sure everyone has somewhere to live during the pandemic shows us homelessness can be endedThere has been a real effort from governments and local authorities across Great Britain to get people off the streets and into hotel rooms, apartments and other forms of self-contained accommodation, so that everyone can follow the guidance and try to protect themselves during the outbreak.This has been crucial in helping to save the lives of so many ndash people facing homelessness, particularly those who are rough sleeping, are hit uniquely hard by this pandemic. They are three times more likely to experience a chronic health condition such as asthma and COPD.#As the weeks and months continue, we know that the increasing pressures on the economy, and people losing their jobs could mean a rise in people being forced into homelessness too.Scotland has long been a world leader in its approach to tackling homelessness and it is good to see the Scottish Governmentrsquos commitment to giving people somewhere safe to live at such a time. But, while itrsquos absolutely right that everyone has been supported into hotels, it is important to remember that this is a necessary emergency response to the pandemic ndash itrsquos not a long-term solution.The speed at which people have been housed should give us much hope that homelessness can absolutely be ended. In a matter of weeks, everyone who needs somewhere to live ndash including those with no recourse to public funds ndash have been given self-contained accommodation, and they have access to healthcare, food and the extra support they need.This makes the case loud and clear that there is no need for people to be sleeping on our streets.The people we speak to living in hotels tell us theyrsquore grateful for being able to have a proper bed, soap and access to three meals a day, but the fear among some is abundantly clear. With no end in sight at the moment to this current crisis, the lack of information as to how long people will be able to stay in their rooms is understandably concerning.One major concern is what will happen to those people who are homeless and have no recourse to public funds because of their immigration status. It is great that they now have self-contained accommodation ndash but therersquos still a huge need for extra support to be put in place, such as providing information about the pandemic and what it means in their own language, or translators being made available.As the barriers that were once in place to finding someone a safe and settled home ndash like low levels of housing benefit ndash are being lted in light of the outbreak we are seeing more options open up. Frontline staff at Crisis are noticing increasingly numbers of affordable properties in Edinburgh, meaning that we have more opportunities to move people into safe, stable housing. We must not see these obstacles reinstated ndash the Scottish Government must work with Westminster to ensure that when the pandemic subsides, we are left with a proper welfare safety net.It shouldnrsquot have taken a pandemic to prove we can end rough sleeping across Great Britain ndash and we shouldnrsquot use the end of the crisis, when it comes, as an excuse to go backwards.Grant Campbell is director of Crisis Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"scots-scientists-join-international-effort-revive-africas-superfoods","story":"For generations of Africans, they were the ldquobare necessities ndash small crops of odd-shaped, strange-tasting fruit and vegetables such as prickly pears, edible roots, leaves and seeds provided nutritional sustenance and played a vital role in their diet.But as Western influences emerged, precious native crops like bitter yam, sweet bush mango, chocolate berries and horned melon were overtaken by belly-filling maize, wheat and rice.Now scientists from Scotlandrsquos Rural College are among an international team looking at ways tolargely forgotten ldquosuperfood crops to African tables, in an effort to help offset deeply worrying levels of malnutrition across the continent.More than  under-utilised plant species ndash known as ldquoorphan crops because they have been largely forgotten in the race towards fields of starchy wheat, rice and maize ndash have been included in the programme.Researchers will look at ways of using genomics to enhance their production and harvesting to encourage food producers, while new marketing techniques to make crops appear ldquocool will be introduced to encourage consumers to take advantage of their exceptional nutritional values.As well as helping to improve nutrition, the programme could help strengthen food production in the face of climate change and population growth: Africarsquos population is predicted to double to . billion people in  years, raising pressure on governments to deliver more food and better livelihoods.It could also lead to a wave of African ldquosuperfoods with exotic flavours and unusual textures being exported to Western markets.Dr Ian Dawson of SRUC, who is part of the African Orphan Crops Consortiumproject, said the crops were ldquoculturally important but had been displaced by alien crops such as maize, rice and wheat, introduced by Western influences.ldquoWheat and maize, for example, are very good at providing energy and have lots of starch, he said. ldquoBut theyrsquore not very good at providing the other range of nutrients that we need for a healthy diet.He added that farmers had often turned away from growing ldquoorphan crops despite their immense nutritional value, to meet rising demand for wheat, maize and rice.ldquoProduction of these culturally important crops has decreased or become restricted.ldquoIn some cases, the lsquoorphanrsquo crops are not regarded as particularly profitable to grow, while a move to a more Western diet, increased urbanisation and people eating more processed foods which are unhealthy but based on staples, has also had an impact on their production.ldquoThe project came from a recognition that there was a need to focus more on nutritional value and, in particular, producing better crops that farmers can grow.Malnutrition, or ldquohidden hunger, in many African nations, is linked to human underdevelopment, causing stunted growth among children, anaemia and obesity.Unicefrsquos  report, The State of the Worldrsquos Children, singled out South Africa in particular as facing a burden of malnutrition, under-nutrition, hidden hunger and obesity.It added that a lack of quality food put children at risk of poor brain development, weak learning, low immunity, increased infections and death.The plants chosen for the project are mostly indigenous to Africa. However, some ndash such as the tellingly-named elephant ears which originated in South America ndash are considered ldquoexotics.Elephant ears plants are popular in Puerto Rican cuisine, typically ground with squash, potato, green bananas and plantains, and mixed with pork and ham before being boiled in a banana leaf.Some plants included in the programme have recognisable names but have suffered from a lack of research into their nutritional qualities which could make them more attractive to farmers and consumers.They include tamarind, a large evergreen tree which produces sticky edible seeds similar to dates jujube, which produce crisp, juicy fruit rich in fibre and vitamin C and sour plums which, despite their tart taste, have a high potassium and protein content.Dawson said genetic enhancement of the crops included in the AOCC programme could help revive interest in the plants among Africarsquos largely female farming communities, who have particular interest in ensuring their families receive a quality, nutritional diet.ldquoCertain crops may not be very profitable ndash they might be hard to produce and there could be a lot of labour costs. Altering a plantrsquos architecture so it doesnrsquot fall over in the field or ensuring the seed or crop remains on the plant and doesnrsquot fall on the ground can make it easier to pick.ldquoMaking the fruit bigger can also make it easier to harvest, he added.ldquoOther genetics could enhance the processability of the crop so itrsquos easier to cook or easier to extract the seed from the plant so it can be incorporated into processed foods.He added: ldquoThere is an export market for some of these crops in a way that quinoa was a South American orphan crop and has now become popular in the UK.ldquoHowever, the risk is that nothing is left for the local people. So therersquos a need not to export all the good stuff.First, however, a major element of the SRUC input into the project is aimed at encouraging farmers and food producers to sht focus from Westernised diets to accept the traditional crops.That may require very Western-style marketing campaigns. ldquoTo have an impact and get crops to farmersrsquo fields, we need to do the genetic stuff but also promote the crops so we get consumers interested in eating them.ldquoOne way is to make these crops look really aspirational and lsquocoolrsquo, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"need-better-system-food-banks-says-pete-ritchie-nourish-scotland","story":"One of the first lessons wersquove had to learn in this crisis is that running out of food is not a problem of supply. Itrsquos a problem of distribution. poundbn worth of food that should be on the shelves is in peoplersquos cupboards and fridges, and too much of this will end up being wasted.Meanwhile, food banks up and down the country view the lockdown announcement with alarm. Will thevolunteers be allowed to leave their home to work in them  Will they get supplies from public donations or be able to buy them from the supermarket  Will they be allowed to stay open Therersquos no doubting the good intentions of the people who run and work in food banks. They have been picking up the pieces of ten years of austerity. But now, enough is enough.Itrsquos completely possible to give people money to buy food themselvesthey have run out of cash. In Scotland, itrsquos called the Scottish Welfare Fund, and itrsquos just been doubled by the Scottish Government. Itrsquos perfectly possible to issue people with a card to use in shops which the Government then loads with money. In Scotland itrsquos called Best Start Foods. Itrsquos perfectly possible in the short term for GPs, schools and welfare agencies to hand out supermarket voucherspeople need them.We have an amazing food distribution system. Cunningly, shops have been located near where people live, and most of them deliver. They are open much of the time. Letrsquos provide ordinary, dignied access to the food distribution system that everyone uses when they can afford it.Making food banks inessential takes a little money, sure. To cover the cost of the food given out each year by Scotlandrsquos foodbanks would be around pound-m ndash % of the poundm investment in tackling poverty announced last week by the Scottish Government.To raise the incomes of the poorest % of the population of the UK by pound per week and make a real dent on food insecurity would cost poundbn ndash % of the rescue package announced last week by the UK government.And it needs a little work to imagine a Scotland without foodbanksndash but rather less than imagining a national lockdown, a ban on weddings, rail renationalisation, no football, no church.Wersquove discovered that we genuinely are all in this together this time. So letrsquos not pretend that it is essential for peoplewho have run out of money for food to go to an agency to get a voucher to travel when therersquos little or no public transport to an inconvenient location at a particular time to get a parcel of food which they havenrsquot chosen, often from an older volunteer who themselves should also be staying at home. And remember, the food itself has come from the supermarket where everyone  goes.

We are all enlisted now."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-stalks-worlds-poorest","story":"Just for a moment pause and consider these glaring global insights from a few of the countries and communities least equipped to tackle the onslaught of coronavirus. Mali in West Africa, for example, has three ventilators per million people. In Zambia, there is one doctor for approximately , people. In Pakistan health spending per head is one two-hundredth the level in the United States, one of the richest countries in the world which itself is struggling to cope with the effects of the virus.:Coronavirus: the decade-old warnings left unheeded by Scottish ministersConsider, too, that currently itrsquos estimated that more than . billion people worldwide live in substandard housing. Of those, at least  million have no home at all.Then there are the  million displaced people worldwide. Among them are the Rohingya in camps on Bangladeshrsquos border with Myanmar and hundreds of thousands of Syrians escaping Idlib province crammed up against the border barrier with Turkey.For many of these people, social distancing is a near impossibility as is regular hand-washing in places often already unsanitary and without clean running water.As statistics go,these are not enough to send a chill down the spine then I donrsquot know what is. I do know that to talk of the world right now feels tough in these times. We are all intimately feeling the pain in one shape or form from the impact of coronavirus.But to ignore what is unfolding where, in far-flung parts of the world, is to do so at our peril.As former president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who beat Ebola in Liberia, put it recently: ldquoCoronavirus anywhere is a threat to people everywhere.While a truism in itself,one other thing is certain in these uncertain times, itrsquos how history has shown us that pandemics hit the poorest hardest.The Spanish flu of   is said to have wiped out % of Indiarsquos population, the vast majority among the countryrsquos poorest and most vulnerable. More recently, most people who died of Aids were African, those from a continent where swathes of the population exist on or below the subsistence level and where healthcare provision is often sparse to say the least.Just last month, Bill Gates, the American business magnate and philanthropist, warned that the pandemic could kill  million Africansit were allowed to rip through the continent. Just now it is wealthy countries that are the epicentre of this deadly virus, but as Jose MariaVera, interim executive director of Oxfam International, ominously observed the other day, already Covid- has started to ldquoprey through the colossal cracks that ide our world.So just what are the implications for the worldrsquos poorest and most vulnerable as the pandemic takes grip within their countries and communities  What must be done to assist in militating against its worst ravages :Scotlands chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood spotted flouting coronavirus lockdown rules in visit to second homeAs Abiy Ahmed, the  Nobel Peace Prize laureate and prime minister of Ethiopia, rightly pointed out in the Financial Times last week,Covid- is not controlled in Africa and other parts of the developing world then it ldquowould quickly bounce back on the rest of the world.Many of the worldrsquos neighbourhoods the pandemic now threatens are the last stop.These are places where a person canrsquot fall any further short of being totally destitute or dead. In many years of covering the world as a reporter, Irsquove seen first hand the struggle to survive in these places of near unimaginable squalor and poverty.Places like the slums of Kibera, Mathare and Korogocho in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, which are among some of the biggest in Africa.In fact, itrsquos estimated that % of Nairobirsquos entire population ndash some . million people ndash are slum dwellers, many living up to  to a single room in little more than a corrugated steel shack.In the Korogocho slum in the city, countless people survive by scavenging the gigantic and infamous Dandora illegal dumpsite. There, thousands of tonnes of waste are heaped daily from across the city, including the unfinished food from the flights arriving at Nairobirsquos international airport, where almost all the coronavirus cases gained entry into Kenya.But those slum dwellers in Africa are far from alone in the teeming cheek-by-jowl existence and wretchedness that blights their lives.Far from Africa on the Caribbean island of Haiti, the poorest country in the western hemisphere and barely a few hours flying time from Miami and New York, people in slums like Cite Soleil likewise live one on top of another in an indescribably filthy warren of alleyways and concrete boxes.During one visit, just after the devastating  earthquake that has since made the situation worse, I was told how , people crammed into a single kilometre in parts of Cite Soleil. So congested was it that ldquosht sleepingrsquorsquo was common, and families would bed down on a rota basis, four hours inside and four hours in the alleyways outside. In such communities the arrival of coronavirus is a near death sentence.For both slum dwellers and often refugees alike, population density is perhaps the first in a series of factors that makes them extremely vulnerable to the spread of the virus. In the case of refugees, multiple families are often forced to share the same bathroom, and the same cooking and bathing facilities,they have access at all.Second, both groups generally have dficulty accessing basic services, especially healthcare. Third, the limited access to reliable information for displaced communities will also complicate efforts to respond. Misinformation, mistrust of authorities, the absence of communication networks, and language barriers can all prevent accurate and far-reaching messaging among those living in urban slums and refugees in informal camps.ldquoWithout critical information about coronavirus, the displaced may not only risk spreading the infection, but find themselves in violation of new policies, warned the humanitarian agency Refugees International in a newly published report addressing the threat posed by Covid- to already existing emergencies involving displaced people across the globe.ldquoAt risk of deportation, asylum seekers without legal status are often reticent to trust local authorities, much less reveal themselves once they get sick, the report highlighted.For aid agencies the challenges are immense as their humanitarian supply chain may be broken by the outbreak and aid workers perhaps have to reduce or cut contact with communities to help prevent spread of the virus. Many humanitarian agencies also warn that they will not have the training or resources to respond to such an unprecedented crisis.All this, too, before the role of politics in impacting on the most vulnerable, as national governments often restrict the movement of international personnel and supplies or close borders. Aid agencies fear a looming disaster both for slum dwellers and those refugees and migrants in informal camps.ldquoWhen the virus hits overcrowded settlements in places like Iran, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Greece, the consequences will be devastating, Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, warned last week. ldquoThere will also be carnage when the virus reaches parts of Syria, Yemen and Venezuela, where hospitals have been demolished and health systems have collapsed.Such challenges for aid agencies and the poorest are only made worse, of course, in those countries where the political leadership is scathing of the threat prosed by the pandemic.In Brazil, for example, president Jair Bolsonaro has dismissed the coronavirus as nothing more than the ldquosnfles and criticised regional lockdown measures.Such is the anger with Bolsonarorsquos response that recently many of those living in Brazilrsquos low-income favelas or unregulated slums in major cities took part in a \"aco\", a protest that involves banging pots together outside a window and screaming insults such as ldquoBolsonaro, out! and ldquoBolsonaro Assassin!.:Highland police forced to add extra patrols amid plans for public COVID- marchStepping into the breach, meanwhile, in the absence of a considered and concerted response by Bolsonarorsquos government, Brazilrsquos drug gangs and paramilitary groups began enforcing social distancing to combat the spread of coronavirus. Just these past weeks, as the Covid- death toll has climbed, gang members have been circulating in the Cidade de Deus ndash City of God ndash favela in western Rio ordering residents to remain indoors after pm.The community, made famous by Fernando Meirelles  movie blockbuster City Of God, was among the first to record a case of coronavirus.ldquoWhoever is caught on the street will learn how to respect the measure. We want the best for the population. If the government is unable to manage, organised crime resolves, read one message circulated by WhatsApp to residents of one Rio slum.But exceptionally bizarre responses such as this aside, it remains national government and help from the international community that most of the worldrsquos poorest communities will depend on in their bitter struggle with the pandemic.Time now is of the essence. Africa has reached a ldquobreak the glass moment, an emergency in which international actors need to take drastic actionthe worldrsquos poorest continent is to avoid a human and economic catastrophe, Ken Ofori-Atta, Ghanarsquos finance minister, told the Financial Times last week.The problem is that so many places are now facing their own ldquobreak the glass emergency moment with potentially nightmarish economic consequences.More than % of the worldrsquos poorest countries ndash and half of those active in international bond markets ndash were already in or at high risk of debt distress before the crisis hit.Some  countries have already approached the International Monetary Fundfor short-term emergency assistance in recent weeks, around double the number that called on the fund in the immediate aftermath of the  financial crisis.As many humanitarian agencies also point out, many responses will have very specic needs that require a strategy tailored to the circumstances of the population in question. As the recent Refugees International report has made clear, however, there are common elements across countries and continents that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.Among those identied include ensuring that the response must be inclusive, reaching all vulnerable populations, including slum dwellers, refugees, asylum seekers, and the internally displaced.It will need to enhance communication and flow of information, deploy medical personnel and protective clothing, improve access to water and hygiene, and focus on isolation and quarantine capacities as well as testing for the virus.If there are positives in all of this one of them is that the population of poor countries are predominately young with a median age of , in theory making many physically more resilient. But offset this against hunger, and already existing ill health, and it is of little comfort.On a more constructive note, especially in Africa, many lessons have been learned from fighting Ebola, but coronavirus is an altogether dferent proposition in terms of infection rate and spread. The bottom line is that any response will be incredibly challenging and problematic for the international community and those organisations tasked with helping those most in need, not least as governments globally look to their domestic needs and demands during the crisis.But it is precisely the scale and speed of the pandemic that has underscored how deeply interconnected the worldrsquos populations are.Across the globe, the poorest and most vulnerable have sometimes been regarded as a sea of lost souls, their lives ignored, hidden from sight or forgotten. The coronavirus pandemic has reminded us all of the dangers in such blindness, as well as the moral imperative that exists to assist those most in need in overcoming the onslaught they now face.Former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is right. Coronavirus anywhere is a threat to people everywhere.________________________________________________________Shops across Scotland are closing. Newspaper sales are falling.

Even Cagney and Lacey could blow hot and cold, with tough talking Christine threatening interviewees with all kinds of stick and Mary Beth virtually making them carrot soup.Odd pairings every one, but none more so than the new combo on the good cop-bad cop block: Windsor and Hancock, better known to viewers as the Queen and the UK Health Secretary.Both had a job to do yesterday: make people stay at home. As trailed in the Sunday papers, the Queen was going to appeal to the publicrsquos higher nature. ldquoI hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge, she was set to say. ldquoAnd those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country.: Glasgow hospital hiring workersThat was the good-cop approach. Earlier in the day it fell to Mr Hancock to tour the Sunday shows and read the riot act, or the Coronavirus Act  as it is more formally known, to all those who thought sunbathing counted as essential exercise.The Health Secretary was responding to the pictures and footage of crowded parks in England on Saturday. Scotland it had been the weather for soup, not sunbathing. ldquoQuite unbelievable, frankly, said Mr Hancock on Sky Newsrsquo Ridge on Sunday.Does that mean, asked Ridge, that sunbathing is against the law  ldquoSunbathing is against the rules that have been set out for important public health reasons, said the Minister. ldquoI wish I did not have to say this but I do, he added in a tone that was more in anger than sorrow.By the time Mr Hancock appeared on The Andrew Marr show he was in a mood to talk even tougher. Marr, like Ridge, was concerned about the social ide between people who had gardens and those stuck in flats.The Minister was not for budging, however. Indeed, he was all for going furthernecessary. ldquoIf you donrsquot want us to have to take the step to ban exercise of all forms outside of your own home, then yoursquove got to follow the rules.: Warnings left unheededMarrrsquos next guest, Sir Keir Starmer, newly elected Labour leader, said he would back the government on further curbs.Sir Keir was setting out his plans to ldquoengage constructively with Boris Johnson and his Ministers. That meant asking dficult questions, he explained, but only for the purpose of pointing out mistakes so they could be put right. Among those errors was being too slow on testing and not having equipment where and when it was needed.Time will tell how much this constructive engagement dfers from the norm, or whether it is just politics as usual but without the shouting. In a parting question to Sir K, Marr said his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn felt vindicated by the crisis. Did he agree ldquoI donrsquot think that this is about vindicating Labour Party policies. The country wants to see politicians and political parties pulling together to face coronavirus, not claiming victory over arguments or otherwise. That sounded like a good old fashioned telling off.Like Sir K, Scottish Labourrsquos new deputy leader, Jackie Baillie, appeared keen on constructive engagement when she appeared on Sunday Politics Scotland. In her case this included bringing up the row over Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, visiting her second home in Earlsferry.ldquoI have enormous respect for her and the job that she does, said the MSP, ldquobut clearly what she did by travelling to her second home was ill-judged. We cannot say to the public follow the guidance and then fail to do so ourselves.: Police issue warning over second home visitThe new deputy leader of UK Labour, Angela Rayner, Skyped into Ridge on Sunday.Like Matt Hancock, the MP for Ashton-under-Lyne is just back at work after being ill. Though she was not hospitalised and therefore tested for the virus, all the symptoms were there.Labour had planned ceremonies to announce its new leader and deputies. Since those had to be cancelled due to the virus, Ms Rayner learned of her victory while sitting on her sofa, self-isolating. It was a strange and surreal experience she said, like being in a movie.Earlier in the show, Ridge had asked the Health Secretary how the Prime Minister, who has the virus, was getting on. Hersquos okay, said Mr Hancock, but he still has a temperature so will be staying at home.When Boris Johnson will be out of isolation is unclear. We do know the Sunday politics shows will be back next week.

There have been concerns around jobs and safety.The organisers of the petition are seeking to halt the plans and are asking for an independent assessment of the decisions and decision-making process around the project to be carried out.A number of MSP#s have stood in opposition to the plans, including Orkney#s Liam McArthur and Shetland#s Beatrice Wishart.Mr McArthur said: “I have been raising concerns about HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic services for some time now. No-one disputes the need to modernise the way in which these services are delivered, but even HIAL’s own consultants identied the ‘remote tower’ option as the most risky and costly.“The estimated costs of the project appear to fall far short of what will realistically be neededit is to have any chance of being delivered successfully. At the same time, staff have made clear the lack of proper consultation and the intention of many to leave the organisation. If that happens, our leline air services will be at risk of serious disruption.“After the members debate earlier this year, led by my Shetland colleague, Beatrice Wishart, the petition will give parliament a further opportunity to consider this issue. These proposals will have a profound effect on our island communities, so it is right that MSPs, particularly those representing the Highlands and Islands, have the chance to hold HIAL and Scottish Ministers robustly to account”.The petition can be found here.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3059734.jpg--.jpg?1585738355000\n","title":"northern regional college makes local ppe donations","story":"NORTHERN Regional College has donated a consignment of personal protection equipmentto hospitals, nursing and care homes across the local area as a sign of solidarity and support for frontline NHS workers at this dficult time.

Civilians using bare hands to find the living and dead from bombed-out buildings. Women standing between raised batons and their sons being arrested.

Who is elderly  Who is sick  Who needs to isolate  Are they ok  Pubs that were rocking to ‘the sounds of the s’ before St Patrick’s Day have been turned into centres gathering food and necessities for the vulnerable. Community centres see lines of volunteers managing social distancing while communally putting boxes and bags together for distribution. Shops and suppliers donating donuts, pot noodles and washing up liquid in trailer loads. Community workers on phones checking in, breaking isolation. Neighbours collecting prescriptions and putting them on garden walls. Grandchildren mowing grass and waving in at grandparents through the window while leaving dinner on the doorstep.From decisive and coordinated community actions to the gentle noticing and caring of neighbours who were once strangers, we see something incredible awakening from this silent, invisible virus.

The unselfish vocations of medical staff are on display.All of us who have placed our lives in the hands of the doctors and nurses of our Health Service will have spoken of angels and our gratitude in times past. But we see now how those angels can also carry shields and swords to go into battle to save the lives of those we love. They will fight for us all.That Health Service personnel have been left without their armour due to dithering, disinvestment, or even constitutional allegiance, is unforgivable.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dr Calderwood attended Methodist College in Belfast. In a statement released on Sunday morning, she said: I wish to apologise unreservedly for the issue reported in the media today.While there are reasons for what I did, they do not justy it and they were not legitimate reasons to be out of my home.While I and my family follow the guidance on social distancing at all times, I understand that I did not follow the advice I am giving others, and I am truly sorry for that. I know how important this advice is and I do want my mistake to distract from that. I have a job to do as chief medical officer to provide advice to Ministers on the path of this virus and to support the medical profession as they work night and day to save lives, and having spoken with the First Minister this morning I will continue to focus entirely on that job.Dr Calderwood said she was also at her second home last weekend with her husband.It has since emerged that police have visited Dr Calderwood and issued her with a warning.Scotland#s Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said in a statement: Earlier today, local officers visited Dr Catherine Calderwood and spoke to her about her actions, reiterated crucial advice and issued a warning about her future conduct, all of which she accepted. The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone.Just days earlier, the -year-old doctor tweeted a photo of her family from their main residence in Edinburgh as they clapped for the frontline NHS staff working to stop the spread of Covid-. The paper says the home in the capital is just two-and-a-half miles from the Scottish Government building where Dr Calderwood delivers daily briefings on the virus with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Earlsferry is a drive of more than an hour from Edinburgh. The images emerged amid continuing advice from the CMO and other leading medical professionals and politicians to stay at home in order to save lives and protect the NHS. Last month, the Scottish Government issued a travel warning criticising the irresponsible behaviour of people with second homes and campervans travelling to the Highlands in a bid to isolate. On Friday, the Scottish First Minister said the upcoming Easter break would be a holiday period unlike any we#ve had in our letimes. Dr Calderwood also stressed people should adhere to the restrictions, and said it was looking less likely summer holidays will take place this year as they have done previously. Dr Calderwood#s colleague, Scotland#s National Clinical Director Jason Leitch said nobody knows the social distancing guidelines better than her and she would not have put people in the area of her holiday home at risk. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: My understanding is that she has worked like the rest of us   on this for weeks now and that family do have a home a little bit away from Edinburgh and they went to check on it. They observed social distancing throughout, so they were very safe. Nobody knows those guidelines better than Catherine and the rest of us. So I#m confident that she was safe during that, her family were safe and those around them were safe. A Scottish Government spokesman said on Saturday: Since this start of this epidemic, the CMO has been working seven days a week preparing Scotland#s response. She took the opportunity this weekend to check on a family home in Fe as she knows she will not be back again until the crisis is over. She stayed overnight before ing to Edinburgh. In line with guidance, she stayed within her own household group and observed social distancing with anyone she was in passing in the village.Nicola Sturgeon said: The chief medical officer made a mistake in travelling away from her home. Whatever her reasons for doing so it was wrong and she knows that. She added: All of us, including me, will make mistakes in these unprecedented times we are living in. When we do we must be candid about it and learn from it. She said the CMO is learning from her error, and added: Over the past few weeks, as we have been dealing with this crisis, her advice and expertise has been invaluable to me. She added that not withstanding her mistake on this, she is doing extremely well. Ms Sturgeon said Dr Calderwood had offered to do whatever is in the best interest of the country. The First Minister added: In my view, that would not be her resignation.Belfast Most ReadBelfast born chief medical officer apologises after being pictured visiting second home during coronavirus lockdownFormer Belfastjournalist Betty McCaw passes away after contracting Covid-Pictured: Thieves make off with clothes after ram-raiding Belfast city centre shopPSNI plea for public to stay at home after early morning car crashFourth man arrested after notorious Dublin hitman shot dead in Ardoyne,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Minister also emphasised that every conceivable effort is being made to improve both situations. “I can assure staff and the wider public that these two issues are receiving absolute priority. It’s no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites. “Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly. googletag.cmd.push “This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs. “I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that. “However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Swann stressed:“I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead. But I want to be totally frank about the pressures that exist. If there were quick fixes available, I would certainly have used them.” Turning to PPE, the Minister said:“Our health service has signicant levels of PPE in stock at present but need to boost these quantities given the expected level of demand in coming weeks. Our PPE supplies have been supported through release of % of the emergency pandemic stockpile as announced last week – in the region of  million items. “Updated UK-wide NHS guidance on PPE use has been issued. This guidance will inform PPE use across our system and help us to prioritise distribution. “I fully understand that staff on the frontline need reassurance. I believe the updated guidance and securing greater quantities of PPE for Northern Ireland will both play a part in allaying concerns. “I want to make absolutely clear that the PPE guidance is about ensuring staff have the appropriate level of protection for the circumstances they are working in – it is absolutely not, nor will it ever be, about seeking to restrict the use of equipment.” He continued:“The situation with PPE supply has been made more challenging by the fact that supply routes from China, a leading global provider, were closed until recently. “I am actively working with the Finance Minister to pursue all feasible supply routes, both international and local. “I recognise that other NI Departments are also facing PPE challenges. We have to tackle this together across the Executive and also to appreciate the scale of global competition for PPE products. The Minister added:“It would be facile for anyone to suggest that there has been any lack of urgency. We are doing everything we can to best of our ability to make things better. “Our health service has been under consider financial pressure for the past  years. That has inevitably had a bearing on its capacity. I cannot undo that, but I will work night and day for the sake of the public and our great health and social care staff. Colleagues right across the system at all levels are doing the same.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like a B-rated sci-fi movie, our world is being ravaged by a killer virus which will affect tens of thousands, maybe millions. No-one knows. The experts disagree. Politicians do too, though that’s less of a concern. Worst, there is no certainty of a happy ending, with a superhero with special powers and a shiny suit to sort it all out. In a world where for almost all illnesses, we have effective diagnosis and treatment, and international experience and research to guide management, this Covid  lark is beyond our comprehension.We people who are accustomed to a pill for every ill must readjust to a new set of paradigms. googletag.cmd.push The prospect of arbitrary illness and possible death, without the presence of loved ones at the bedside, and for those of faith, the comfort of the sacraments, is terrying. For families, being unable to have the beautul and peculiarly Irish ritual of farewell, a wake and funeral to grieve and offer thanks, compounds the dread. We know that the young and healthy are likely to come through this, and that it is our elderly who are likely to succumb. Many of the sacrices we make are to protect the vulnerable and those who care for them. But there are no guarantees that any of us is safe. googletag.cmd.push Prince and pauper are vulnerable-tho it’s fair to assume that the prince isn’t coping from a homeless shelter or wracked with worry about how the bills will be paid. As with all human endeavour, there is goodness in abundance. People are delivering hot meals from their own resources to the isolated and vulnerable. Supermarket staff are stocking shelves, scanning tins and packets and smiling through the fear. Council staff empty bins, clean the streets and work from home to keep the wheels of this city turning. Bus drivers, mechanics, what we used to call lorry drivers but are now logistics operatives, all are at their posts, so that we can eat and stay healthy. Mammies and daddies, facing their own worries are reassuring their children that all will be well, putting them over their lessons and trying their best to keep them occupied and safe.So many people who have left work are offering their skills and experience to help in whatever way they can. Machinists skilled from years in Derry’s factories are working at home making masks to protect their neighbours. An incredible , people have volunteered to help the beleaguered NHS. A friend confided regarding her own health worries that she wasn’t concerned so much about herself, but about what might happen her mother with dementia, for whom she cares at home. This is love in action. Our postman came this morning, our usual chat done at two metres distance. We still managed to cover our usual repertoire of politics, weather, health and families, while keeping two metres part. My washing machine packed in. Well I think it’s a vital service, so I rang the man, fully expecting him to tell me to get lost. He told me he would look at it, but wanted to work alone, as his son is immunosuppressed. He came in the back door, I left the money in an envelope, and my clothesline now flutters with clean sheets. I feel especially for our young people, the unique, primal, mad impulsive joy of teenage springtime pulsing in their veins with the first sunny days. They are staying indoors, chatting online, putting in the days, making mad memes for the craic and to keep sane. My niece, doing her Leaving, and with no prospect of exams, is still doing a bit of study, and helping her daddy plant spuds.Her school days ended without the rituals of parties and goodbyes. Even our wee Fionnuala, my four year old grandchild, who lives with us and is the light of our lives in these dark days, knows that school is now at the kitchen table, because of the bad germs which and might make people sick. She washes her hands hourly - and the floor and walls - with enthusiasm and great care. Everywhere, people are doing what they must, often at great personal cost, while struggling with their own worries about work, bills and what the future will bring. They do these things cheerfully and in the best way they can. Superheroes don’t always wear fancy costumes, they are all around us. In these surreal times, we see our old certainties and values exposed as worthless. They seem to have been replaced by an older and more tried and tested value system, less about rights, and more about what is right. Let’s hope that these lessons stick when Covid  is a distant memory.

Slaughtneil, Ballinderry and Craigbane have emerged since , before going on to take provincial honours. There has been a new breed coming knocking at the door in recent years in the form of Glen, Lavey and reigning champions Magherafelt. Over the coming weeks, the County Derry Post will select a series of Derry club teams from the last decade. Up first is Michael McMullan, who delved through the ious players on the club scene to select his team of the decade, from  to .  – Antoacutein McMullan  googletag.cmd.push Began his knock-out championship career with a man of the match performance in the  quarter-final against Glenullin. McMullan was forced to successfully change his kick-out strategy when Mickey Moran introduced a more fluid central spine. Was immense in  against Kilcoo and Kilcar as Slaughtneil won a third Ulster title.  – Oisin Duffy  Despite failing to break into the Derry minor team in his final year, Duffy went on to play at senior level for the county. He was the driving force at the heart of Foreglens drive to two intermediate championship titles and their stint in senior football. At home as a marker or initiating attacks from his role at centre back. googletag.cmd.push  – Dermot McBride  McBride was one of the best man markers in the red and white of Derry during the early part of the decade. In his club colours, he carried on this level of consistency and has played anywhere in the back six – helping them to the  county final. He has defied a series of injuries to extend his playing career to this season.  – Karl McKaigue  The Emmets defender has been one of the main reasons behind Slaughtneils watertight unit. In , he held his direct opponent scoreless in all eight games on their way to the Ulster title. He is not just a maker, he is comfortable on the ball and has often been a receiver of short kick-outs to help his side build from the back.  – Brendan Rogers  Made his name as a full-back, but has excelled anytime he gets let loose on the wing. Ballinascreen tried to pull him out in a county final and he went on the rampage – building attacks. He attacked Ballinderrys Ryan Bell last season and when the Emmets were defeated by Glen, Rogers almost reeled them back in.  – Connor Nevin  Won a championship medal in this first season in  and went on to pick up another three, including an Ulster title as captain five years later. Has played everywhere from full-back to midfield. In recent years, when Ballinderry have been away from the top table, he still puts his shoulder to the wheel. A tough, yet quiet, character.  – Chrissy McKaigue  Made his debut while still in the minor grade, McKaigue spent a brief spell with Sydney Swans at the start of the decade, but ed to be spiritual leader of Slaughtneils golden era. He has played at full-back, but is more at home in the centre where he can dictate the terms of the game. Will regularly get forward to chip in with a score.  – Patsy Bradley  Was his debut as a high-fielding wing-back  years ago, but it was only a matter of time before he became Slaughtneils midfield general. Patsy may lack the height of many other midfielders but certainly made up for it with his salmon-like jump and hang time. It was inspirational and he often popped up when Slaughtneil needed him most.  – Niall Holly  Had he not picked up a nasty shoulder injury at the vital conjuncture against Scotstown, two years ago, Coleraine may well have pushed on an picked up an Ulster title. Can play at full-back but a colossus at midfield and his absence from the county team has been a huge void. Tall, mobile and tough. The perfect midfielder.  – Sean Leo McGoldrick  The number on the jersey is irrelevant for Sean Leo, giving his possession game from wing back to wing forward. He has to be every managers dream. Busy, comfortable on the ball and always takes the right option. When Lavey threatened to stage their late comeback in the  final, it was Sean Leo at the heart of their insurance point.  – Enda Muldoon  Made his senior debut as a goalkeeper in the  McGlinchey Cup. The following season, he spearheaded Ballinderrys attack on their way to his first championship. It was the start of a stellar career of arguably the best club player of his generation. A chief scorer, a target for kick-outs and can pass the ball with effortless accuracy.  – Enda Lynn  Some county players fade away in club football. Enda Lynn is not one of them. Despite being kicked from pillar to post, as Greenloughs talisman, he led the Wee Reds from intermediate football to being seconds away from a senior county final. Handles the ball more than most and is potent as an inside forward.  - Raymond Wilkinson  Crook has played in a number of roles for Ballinderry. His two goals sank Kilrea in the  final and he found the net the following year to break Banaghers resolve in the semi-final. He has played both as busy link man in the half-forward line and inside for Shamrocks. He also made a comeback to play in recent years.  – Mark Lynch  Came to prominence as a  year old, in Derrys last All-Ireland minor win. Was always destined for greatness. Played up front for Banagher and led the line to perfection and his six points almost shot them into the county final. Switched to midfield when they won the intermediate title and last season, they were touching distance from the senior decider.  – Conleith Gilligan  Was Derry minors penalty scoring goalkeeper in . Three years later he led Ballinderry to All-Ireland sevens success as the fly keeper, but came to the fore as the playmaker for their All-Ireland club win. In his later years, he reinvented himself as an inside forward, where he carried their scoring mantle until he eventually retired.

The new system will be operational from Monday next, April , to assist in dealing with increasing requests from the public regarding excess refuse that has been accumulated as a result of the current emergency situation. Karen Phillips, Director for Environment and Regeneration with Derry City and Strabane District Council, told councillors yesterday that the new service would include a dedicated helpline that would be manned, Monday to Friday from am to pm, with a team of staff to process and categorise all calls. googletag.cmd.push The calls would be fed into a central system, that in turn will co-ordinate each request for collection by district ward, with each area being served on specic allocated days of the week. It was outlined to members that only excess residual, green and garden waste would be collected, with no provision being made for bulky waste collections, which unfortunately cannot be collected during this emergency situation. Collections would be carried out by area and on specic days of the week and only directly from domestic premises that have made pre-arranged collections with Council, with no kerbside waste being permitted. It was reiterated to members that this service is an emergency response to assist in resolving the increased pressure on waste services and the public will be strongly advised that they must continue to fully utilise the existing refuse collection services that continue to operate as normal. googletag.cmd.push The council said they will continue to put a strong emphasis on the recycling message, re-enforcing the need for the public to continue to maximise the use of their blue and brown bins. It is hoped that this additional service will assist in providing support to vulnerable members of the community and those with specic issues with medical or additional residual waste, such as larger families and will prevent fly-tipping. She reassured members that refuse collection staff providing this service would be adhering to strict social distancing guidelines and health and safety measures. She said checks to identy members of the public who are self-isolating would be done by staff prior to the collection being arranged. Members were informed that messaging and advice on double bagging also be communicated to those availing of the service, adding that the council would review the service on a daily basis and had the capacity to put additional resources in place according to demand. It was also outlined to members that the new service, while being operational from next week, would take a number of days to roll out and the public would be encouraged to be patient and co-operate with council during this process.

Behind his boyish grin, he is consuming the fading remnants of county final Sunday. Its all about savouring the scene where unforgettable memories were made. Every last second. In his interview with the County Derry Post, the Rossa forward confesses to not having attended many county finals. They were a dficult watch, like running your eyes over the dream you may never have. Now its real and over the hours and days which follow, Magherafelt would deservedly celebrate like never before. The clubs senior famine was over. googletag.cmd.push Three days later, McElhone would be back in the inner sanctum of a dressing room on final day, this time as a part of Enda Quinns U management team. In the midst of Monday nights celebrations, he had one eye on Lavey. They were going to be a tough assignment, he admitted. Any team with Matthew and Callum Downey on board was going to be a serious proposition. But, theyd give it a lash. When game day arrived, conditions were dficult, but it was Magherafelt who prevailed, adding to their senior, reserve, U , U and U championships. Their U, U and minor leagues were also added, on the back of being the current U champions – before withdrawing to concentrate on preparations for an Ulster clash with Kilcoo. googletag.cmd.push “The negative was, theydidnt get their proper nights sleep the few days before a vital championship game,” states Enda Quinn, who doubles up as the clubs current Youth Officer. They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass.

Patients will not be able to report directly to the centre without being referred by their own GP or the Downersquos out-of-hours service.In addition, patients attending the centre will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.The new centre is designed to allow GPs and health and social care staff to work together in a suitable clinical environment and to plan what is best for the inidual in terms of treatment and any additional care they need.Defending the decision to close a number of services at the Downe Hospital, the South Eastern Trust says that each of its hospitals and services has a vital role to play in the fight against COVID-.ldquoWe must now make changes to some services in all of our hospitals to prepare for the additional critical care services needed and to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients, it said in a statement.ldquoWe must deploy our staff and resources to best position us to provide the critical care which will be required for our local populations and to give our staff the essential training they need in order to equip them as much as possible for the challenge ahead.The health trust says that it needs to ensure that its staff can be as prepared as possible to help fight the impact of COVID-.The statement continued: ldquoRetraction of the most acute services from some sites, in a planned manner, is the best way to support our entire patient population and gives our staff the best chance to prepare for and manage the challenges and pressures upon us.ldquoThe Downe Hospital will play a vital role as part of the hospital network in responding to this crisis, particularly through the provision of inpatient services and through working alongside primary care to enable as many patients as possible to be cared for at home.Health chiefs say they believe it is imperative to respond now to provide the local community with the best possible outcomes and also to support staff as best it can.The health trust says it recognises the importance and value of all its sites and services within its communities.The statement adds: ldquoThe Trust would like to assure the community that changes made over the coming weeks and months are solely part of the effort to meet and manage the challenges presented by COVID-, the scale of which we have never faced before.ldquoAll service changes will continue to be reviewed and monitored, with the intention to fully restore services to normal as soon as possible. Every one of us has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus.

Dr McBride is not only CMO, he has directly relevant experience of infections, having become a consultant specialist in one of the worst pandemics, HIV, almost  years ago. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Other experts include Dr Alan Stout, chair of the British Medical Association GP committee in NI, who has for weeks calmly stated that the UK has some of the world’s best scientists, that the advice is good and should be followed.When I tweeted recently about the UK’s outstanding scientic leaders, some people wonderedit was a sleight on the Irish experts. Yet I assume that the Republic has similar numbers pro rata of brilliant medical and scientic people to the UK, but the latter has almost  times more people and  times more experts.Republicans haveaccused unionists of slavishly following British advice, when almost the opposite has happened: all the key figures in Northern Ireland’s response to the crisis support close co-operation with the Republic, as makes sense on an island, while republicans have obsessively promoted all-island responses, and trashed the overall UK approach.The party wants a severe lockdown, closing manufacturers such as Ulster Carpets who say they are practising safe social distancing for employees, yet it delayed on granting powers to the PSNI . NI was the last place in the UK to clary what police could do.Ms O’Neill is implying that the WHO and UK have an utterly erging approach, when in fact they have largely the same approach with some dferences.It is not unreasonable for the deputy first minister, without expertise, to think that one group of scientists is right and another wrong. Lord Sumption, the ex Supreme Court judgewho said the UK Covid- response was hysterical , pointed out that we are not ruled by scientists. We apply our own critical faculties to advice he said.But what a coincidence that in applying such critical thinking, Sinn Fein cannot find a UK gesture that it likes, such as soldiers rapidly helping increase hospital beds for the patients for whom republicans profess such concern or the Treasury using its firepower to offer big support to business and citizens.If Ms O’Neill and her party are so damning of the UK, it is strange that they never issued a critique of the records ofearly deliberations of Britain’sScientic Advisory Group for Emergencies . The war historian Sir Lawrence Freedman analysed them for the long respected, left leaning New Statesman journal. It showed how experts were agreed on some responses, but uncertain or ided on others. The UK is now behind on tests but few nations have found it easy: the Republic set up community tests before retreatingwhen it was swamped. Testing has been a problem for all but the most prepared places like South Korea .The UK is badly behind on Personal Protection Equipment and ventilators, as are most nations.But the WHO is not beyond criticism. Its response to the situation in China in January was at first confused and perhaps complacent and I suspect it is too trusting of the recent Chinese data of miniscule infection rates and death numbers. WHO also seemed unable to answer easily this newspaper’s elementary query on whether global data distinguished between deaths of people who had the virusand deaths caused by it . Such a distinction is crucial to understanding the lethality of coronavirus.The validity of some early UK concerns are becoming apparent, such as damage to mental health of starting lockdown too early .It is not surprising, or even wrong, that republicans saw first Brexit then Covid- as opportunity for a cherished, centuries old goal of a single independent Ireland.What is wrong is that they have bought into an abnormal system of mandatory coalition , which can only work on the basis of collective responsibility . After Brexit, Sinn Fein cited RHI to collapse devolution but then made other demands for its .

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I was the one who had put an order for an item by phone and this was it being delivered by the company, right on time as they had promised.Having to live almost permanently indoor is surely sapping my memory. When I plucked up the courage to do some shopping – an absolute necessity since we’d eaten a lot more than we had realised – another hazard of being marooned indoors – and the experts were warning of a lockdown probably lasting much longer than anticipated, I took one look at the queue of people lined almost right around a supermarket car park each one two trolley s from the next person with the rain threatening to drench them. I decided I’d go hungry first before I would join them.I drove off to the next supermarket and remarkably managed to get parked very close to the front door where a man in unorm indicated where the trollies were and asked me nicely to wait a few seconds to allow a shopper inside to exit. Inside were other shoppers and I found myself, like them, doing a kind of shopping waltz trying to keep a distance. This was a store packed with everything any family could possibly need. So where were all the so-called shortages of essential items like butter and bread not to mention frozen goods  Who has been creating all the fuss, leading to people having to put up with the rain in outside queues I was in and out in no time and headed off to the third supermarket in the area, the only one I know stocks my favourite wine. Here too there were no queues, just a nice little chunky man in a yellow jacket waving us all to a dferent door than the normal one. The floor was marked with ious crosses and arrows, but otherwise freedom of movement was as normal. I found myself the only person in the off-licence section and even better, my favourite wine was on offer. All round, this shopping experience was much better than I’ve experienced prior to coronavirus and its restrictions.When Himself brought me the News Letter to read earlier this week the headline sobered me up somewhat as, after my successful shopping spree I was beginning to think that maybe this whole virus thing wasn’t that inconvenient after all. Surely this pampered generation could all manage without feeling put upon  And, there it was, two lines of type which shocked me to the core: Council digs graves to be ready for surge in deaths.The story attached revealed that since  people here had already died – the number of people with the illness,  - Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed they had ‘taken the drastic step to dig more in case there was widespread sickness among staff at a later date’. Drone footage had shown a large number of burial plots being prepared at the council’s new Sixmile Cemetery site in Antrim.The previous day Stormont Minister Conor Murphy, Sinn Fein, revealed that Stormont next year would get a big boost to its spending – up by .pc to more than £bn – the boost separate from the extra funding of £m allocated to deal with the coronavirus outbreak – yet he refused when questioned to declare his support for the British Army coming here to help build the necessary emergency hospitals to deal with those stricken by the virus.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety.ldquoToday, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones.ldquoBut now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do.ldquoWhile we have faced challenges before, this one is dferent.ldquoThis time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal.ldquoWe will succeed ndash and that success will belong to every one of us.ldquoWe should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will : we will be with our friends again we will be with our families again we will meet again.ldquoBut for now, I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: The Queen us broadcast in full article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Its no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites.Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly.This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs.I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that.However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.Mr Swann stressed: I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead. But I want to be totally frank about the pressures that exist. If there were quick fixes available, I would certainly have used them.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_dafcccaadaabcad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_dceadebeeacefb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
