She is pictured with, left to right, George, Grace and twins Fredrica and FrancescaHowever demanding your week has been, spare a thought for Tracey Britten, the UK’s oldest mother to give birth to quadruplets.Over the past seven days, Tracey, 51, has fed her babies 224 bottles of formula milk, changed 168 nappies, dressed her offspring 56 times and dished out 28 baths, all on less than three hours’ sleep a night.While her husband Stephen, 39, mucks in when he’s home, he works full-time, so she can perhaps be excused for not having washed her hair for six weeks — and only taking the quads outdoors on her own once since they came home from hospital last month.‘You do have moments late at night when you think: “Oh my God, what have I done?” admits Tracey, who is alone with the babies for up to 12 hours a day. ‘It’s hard graft. But then, quick as a flash, I think: “It’s only for a few months — they will be able to feed themselves soon.”‘I don’t regret it. I wouldn’t have had them if I didn’t want them — and it will get easier.‘Some people may think it’s selfish to become a mum again at my age, but I don’t worry about not being around to see my babies grow up. I’m fit and healthy and look after myself, so I fully expect to live long enough to see my grandchildren.‘I may be the oldest mum at the school gates, but who cares? Most women are leaving it later to have kids nowadays, and people always tell me I look much younger than I am.’          Tracey and Stephen had IVF treatment in Cyprus and admits she was dumbfounded, when she saw the scan, pictured, asking the sonographer: ‘How am I going to cope with four babies?’She does indeed look younger than her years, but one can’t help but wonder how she will cope with the challenge once her babies start crawling in four different directions.Her three little girls and a boy were delivered by Caesarean section, 31 weeks into her pregnancy, at London’s University College Hospital on October 26 last year.Tracey and Stephen had travelled overseas for IVF treatment at the Team Miracle Cyprus IVF Centre, in what was a final roll of the dice after ten years of trying for a baby. It was their first attempt at IVF, and cost £7,000.In all, four embryos were implanted into Tracey’s womb three survived, one of which split into two, creating identical twin girls.Tracey was already a mother to three grown-up children — a daughter and two sons — and grandmother to eight, aged between 11 and one, while Stephen, a roofer, has a teenage son.The couple’s desperate desire to become parents again was, admits Tracey, rooted in the guilt and trauma she felt after having a late abortion, aged 39, because the ‘timing wasn’t right for a baby’.          Tracey, pictured while pregnant with the quads, is also a mother to her three grown-up children and grandmother to eightShe deeply regretted the termination, carried out when she was 19 weeks pregnant, and sank into a depression. This was compounded when her beloved mother, Pauline, died unexpectedly six weeks later, due to a blockage in the main artery to her heart.Tracey convinced herself this was karma, a punishment for ending her unborn son’s life. Shortly after her 50th birthday, Tracey decided to use the cash her late mother had left in her will to fund IVF treatment in Cyprus, where the clinic implanted four embryos at once, which doctors said would maximise her chances of conceiving — a strategy that is not permitted in the UK to prevent risky multiple births.Although Tracey knew it was a possibility, she admits she burst into tears after discovering she was carrying quads at her nine-week scan.Dumbfounded, she asked the sonographer: ‘How am I going to cope with four babies?’Two weeks later, Tracey, who has a history of premature labour, developed severe stomach pains. She went to her local hospital, where doctors advised her to ‘reduce’ the pregnancy by having two of the foetuses injected in the womb to stop their hearts.This, she was told, would increase the remaining two babies’ chances of survival. But Tracey had bonded with her quads, after seeing them in numerous scans, and could not contemplate saying goodbye to any of them. Her decision to ‘let nature take its course’ paid off, and the quads — George, Grace and twins Fredrica and Francesca — are now 12 weeks old.At birth, George was the heaviest at 3lb 10oz, Francesca was 2lb 12oz, Grace 2lb 7oz and Fredrica a tiny 1lb 15oz.When I arrive at the family’s three-bedroom bungalow in North London, I fully expect to be greeted by a dishevelled Tracey surrounded by bottles, nappies, baby wipes, vomit-streaked muslin cloths and a cacophony of screaming.Oh fox it! Two-year-old leaves her family in hysterics...Identical twin sisters who were separated as babies discover...Share this articleHowever, the place is clean and tidy and the girls are either sleeping or sitting calmly in their bouncy chairs while George — still the biggest by far at around a stone in weight — is fresh out of the bath.‘People expect to walk into a madhouse, then comment on how calm it is,’ says Tracey. ‘I think it’s because I was calm during pregnancy. I tried not to let anything stress me. and if I did feel stressed I put on some meditation music.‘Of course, I knew it wouldn’t be easy, but I decided to just take each day as it comes.’As Tracey puts the kettle on to make us tea (I offer, but she insists!) I notice a long, handwritten list on the kitchen counter detailing all the times each baby has been fed using miniature bottles of prescription-only formula, designed for premature infants. A peek inside the fridge reveals 24 more bottles lined up ready for the day ahead.‘We had to start writing everything down, because in the early days we’d forget which ones had been fed,’ says Tracey. ‘We kept the hospital name tags on their ankles, too, so we could tell them apart. We couldn’t always be sure, especially in the dead of night.‘Now we can tell who’s who at a glance, partly because Fredrica is smaller than Francesca and the other two look different.’          Tracey has fed her babies 224 bottles of formula milk over the past seven days. Pictured is the mother on This Morning with Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield The quads spent six weeks in incubators and there were setbacks, including George catching flu at two weeks and Fredrica struggling to digest her tube-fed formula milk.George also has reflux for which he has been prescribed Gaviscon, which makes him constipated.Still, three of them were allowed home on December 8, two days before Tracey’s 51st birthday, while Fredrica was finally feeding well enough to join her siblings a week before Christmas, at nearly eight weeks old. They now sleep two to a cot beside their parents’ double bed. By the time they move into the nursery, at around six months old, Tracey is hoping to buy two twin cots so that they can all fit comfortably into one room.While prematurity and low birth weight are risk factors for numerous conditions, including cerebral palsy, vision problems and hearing loss, the quads appear to be healthy and reaching their milestones. Doctors at the Whittington Hospital in North London will keep an eye on their development, as difficulties are not always obvious so early on.Luckily for their parents, the babies rarely cry all at once — except for the evening they had their eight-week injections: ‘They were obviously in pain and cried all night,’ Tracey recalls.‘Thankfully, they were fine the following day.’Last week, however, Tracey went 24 hours without closing her eyes, because at least one baby was crying for attention throughout that time.‘I had to keep moving, rocking them and doing jobs, because I knew if I sat still I would nod off,’ she says. ‘Usually they sleep for about four or five hours in the daytime, and I should really take that opportunity to rest, too, but I’ve got so much to do: making up bottles, laundry, cleaning, making the beds and cots. By the time I’ve done all that, it’s feeding and winding time again.‘It’s hard to describe what it’s like, to be honest. It sometimes feels as though I’m having an out-of-body experience and watching someone else do it.’Keeping on top of all this would be a huge challenge for any mother, but for a woman in her sixth decade — with a touch of arthritis and a bad back — it sounds crippling.But while admitting she is utterly exhausted, Tracey claims that, in some ways, she is coping better than she did as a young mum.‘Obviously, it’s a lot harder than when I had just one baby at a time,’ she says. ‘But I’m older now and have more patience. I was only 18 when I had my eldest daughter and you think you’re missing out on things at that age.‘Everyone is going out and telling you what a great time they’re having, but I’ve done all that now.’Still, these days most of her contemporaries are enjoying precious leisure time as their children become self-sufficient, while Tracey will be 68 before her quads come of age.But she appears to have a remarkable ability not to project her thoughts beyond the here and now — a quality she believes is at the root of her babies’ easy-going temperaments.Having raised ‘three good kids’, she’s not worried about coping with teenagers in her 60s, either.At 39, Stephen is more than a decade younger than his wife and a very capable, hands-on dad who, despite having to be up for work at 5am, is in charge of grocery shopping and cooking dinner.But there was one day recently when Stephen left for work and Tracey realised he’d forgotten to buy milk for her tea.The prospect of 12 hours in sole charge of four babies without caffeine was too much to bear, so Tracey decided to wheel them to the local shop.It took her 20 minutes to assemble the pram, then another 20 minutes to get the babies into their warm snow suits and strapped in.The ten-minute walk stretched into half an hour as one passerby after another stopped to look into the pram and ask questions. That was the first and last time Tracey — who says the weight of the pram put a strain on her bad back — has ventured out with them alone.So when any of the quads has a medical appointment, Stephen, who has a very understanding boss, must take a day off work to drive them there. Tracey can’t take all the babies as their special pram will not fit into the family’s Ford Galaxy — they are looking for a second-hand Mercedes Viano.When anyone refers to him as ‘the proud father’, Stephen jovially replies: ‘Exhausted father, more like. My mates at work tease me about how long it’ll be before I can have a night out with them again.‘But I don’t want to go out,’ he adds. ‘The idea of getting home after a few drinks and having to do the night shift, or coping with four babies when you’ve got a hangover is too awful.‘The tiredness is the hardest thing — when you know you’ve got to be up for work and you’ve had no sleep.‘At the moment, all they need is to be fed and cleaned but when they start running around it might be trickier.’Although Stephen must keep bringing home the bacon — the nappy bill alone comes to nearly £100 a month, that doesn’t mean he gets to put his feet up at the end of a working day. ‘He’ll say: “I’m going to have a soak in the bath”, and I’ll say: “Never mind that, be quick and come and see to these bloody kids — I’ve no time for a soak,” ’ says Tracey, laughing throatily.‘I even shout to hurry up when he’s in the loo, and he complains he can’t sit on the couch because there are babies on every cushion.’Being constantly on the move means Tracey regained her figure in record time, and was able to fit back into her size 12 jeans two weeks after giving birth.She certainly doesn’t look like a woman who gave birth to quads less than three months ago.She is also relieved that, despite criticism levelled at her while pregnant — she was called ‘selfish’ for having IVF at 50, resulting in quads whose care is ‘likely to cost the NHS hundreds of thousands of pounds’ — public opinion since the birth has been much more supportive.Her one regret is that her babies aren’t getting the one-to-one attention she was able to give her older children.‘With one, you can cuddle them all the time,’ she says. ‘But at the hospital they told me to put them down after each feed so they don’t get too used to being held and cry when they’re laid down — I’ve only got one pair of arms.‘Instead, if they’re all awake I put cartoons on the TV and face their bouncy chairs towards it.’Using television to distract infants may go against normal parenting advice, but it’s clear that Tracey — who’s hoping for recognition as Britain’s oldest mum of quads in the Guinness Book of Records — will have little time in the foreseeable future to worry about social conventions."},{"url":null,"title":"Vegetarians blast McDonalds served wraps accidentally packed chicken nuggets","story":"    Meat feast: Photos posted by a customer of a wrap containing chicken, which was replaced with pesto after she complainedBut now it has emerged that staff at a number of branches across the country have accidentally served it with chicken nuggets instead of the red pesto vegetarian goujon it is supposed to contain.Emma Longley, a customer who was served chicken at a branch in Newcastle, wrote online: ‘Just ordered the veggie wrap, turns out you gave me chicken.

Pictured: a seal who got a plastic frisbee stuck around her neck, causing a deep incisionFor while The Beatles were recording Sergeant Pepper in 1967, Nathaniel Wyatt was wondering whether fizzy drinks could be carried around in lightweight containers. It took him a few years in a DuPont lab to get the design and chemical formula right, but by 1973 he had invented and patented the plastic bottle.Nathaniel Wyatt retired soon after, having given the world a sort of freedom. And how we loved it!One of the characteristics of modern life is how much of it is lived on the move.‘Shall I grab us a couple of coffees?’ a colleague shouts, before returning with a disposable container which magically doesn’t leak. If you have time for them, lunches are eaten in cars, supper is a sandwich on a train.How you can clean up Britain: Last year 20,000 wonderful...From bamboo toothbrushes to underwear made from old fishing...Share this articlePlastic bottles, plastic tops and linings to coffee cups and plastic wrappings on food make life liveable. Last year alone, we used more than 13 billion plastic bottles in Britain.There is nothing inherently wrong with synthetic plastic. When the Victorian scientist Alexander Parkes invented the first man-made plastic he wasn’t setting out to make a killing machine, like his fellow resident of South Norwood cemetery, Hiram Maxim, creator of the machine gun.But we have somehow turned this useful substance into a blight on the planet which is doing far more damage than machine guns ever did.Once upon a time, plastic was full of promise. It was cheap and light and could be made into just about any shape. It was waterproof and protected food from contamination. In the early days, it was even seen as an instrument of female liberation because women no longer needed some simian male to lift things for them.How did it all go wrong?It didn’t happen by chance. We made it go wrong, because we’re stupid and idle and thoughtless. It’s too easy to blame manufacturers of sweet, fizzy drinks for the problem.For sure, we should all do something to persuade the dimwits at drink companies to think of containers that won’t trouble our great-grandchildren. If Coca-Cola is part of the problem, it’s unlikely to be part of the solution.But litter isn’t their problem. It’s ours. It is not the manufacturers who chuck the empty bottles onto the roadside. It is us. Someone you know is almost certainly an anti-social yob. It’s reckoned that over half of Britain’s plastic bottles end up being recycled. Which means that nearly half of them are not. Billions of plastic bottles are, therefore, being tipped into the ground, burned, or left to contaminate the countryside.Think back to the places you loved as a child — fields, hills, rivers or parks. If you experienced them before Dr Wyeth made his discovery in the Sixties, you probably recall them looking much the same as they had for generations. Perhaps for centuries.Today, unless you are lucky enough to have a conscientious local authority or team of litter volunteers, the place you fondly remember is likely to be strewn with rubbish. Beauty spots have an odd effect on some people, causing them to create ugliness. Weirdly, homo sapiens seems to have developed an urge to foul his own nest.          How did it all go wrong? It didn’t happen by chance. We made it go wrong, because we’re stupid and idle and thoughtless. Pictured: a mallard duck entangled in plastic in Richmond Park, south west LondonWe have all seen the photos of dogs, cats, turtles suffering pain or starvation after being snared or poisoned by waste plastics, whether bottles, jars, fishing nets or even, sometimes, fibres of plastic so small that they are virtually invisible to the human eye. We may not kill them intentionally, yet as a species we do it anyway.Plastic on the ground gets washed into watercourses and then rivers, and from there into the sea. Those plastic bottles along the tide-line at your favourite beach could have come from more-or-less anywhere.In fact, last year, a Mail investigation, headlined ‘Dustbin of the World’, revealed that plastic items washed up on a Cornish beach had come from as far afield as North Korea and Florida.Not only that, one toy plastic ship discovered in the Arctic recently started life in a British cereal packet in 1958 — proof, if proof were needed, that plastic is designed to be well-nigh indestructible. That’s why areas like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an enormous expanse of ocean roughly twice the size of France, survives from year to year, with rubbish washing from one side of the ocean to the other. And that is just what we can see.Plastic pollution is now so widespread that, as Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King’s College, London, revealed in the Mail only a few months ago, we are now all breathing in microscopic particles of plastic, with no idea of what they may be doing to us.Environmentalists often sound like their own worst enemies, because they have spent so long crying ‘wolf’ that one might as well grind their sandals to dust and mould them into earplugs.So what if they predict — as they do — that within 30 years there will be a greater volume of plastic in the sea than there will be fish? Perhaps they’re right, but we cannot comprehend it, simply because we have never before had to live with detritus that goes on more-or-less for ever. As a mere citizen, it reduces you to a feeling of utter powerlessness.If you bought a packet of peanuts in the Sixties, they came in a paper bag. Now, the bag is coated with plastic. The manufacturers have chosen to do it for understandable reasons — it keeps the peanuts inside dry and clean. But the plastic remains virtually indestructible, and we seem to have no choice in that.If we have a sudden craving for peanuts, our grandchildren will be living with the container long after we are providing food for worms. The snack we enjoyed was gone in minutes. We didn’t buy the packet as some sort of legacy gift, but the wrapping it came in will be there for decades.And it is not just self-righteous environmentalists in shapeless jumpers who predict Armageddon. Common sense tells us that if every year increasing quantities of this toxic material end up lying about the place, then sooner or later it will engulf us. There is trouble ahead.I cannot do anything about the plastic bags which litter the deserts of the Middle East or the bottles, drainpipes and jars that float down the Yangtze River in China.But I can do something about the garbage that is piling up at the sides of British highways. I can begin by not adding to it.The other day, walking half a mile on a country lane six miles from the nearest town, I picked up four plastic bottles, two McDonald’s wrappers, two fish-and-chip shop styrofoam trays, six chocolate wrappers, three cigarette packets, two plastic hubcaps, the back of a mobile phone, assorted bits of unidentifiable junk and a plastic doll’s leg.Doubtless, there was some story attached to each of the items. Collectively, they tell no story beyond the contamination of the countryside.We have all seen morons throwing trash from their cars. Why do they do it? Presumably they do it because they don’t want it in their cars. But they are too stupid to understand that jettisoning it from their vehicle merely means that it becomes a problem for everyone, and that everyone includes them.          Fifty years ago, this problem did not exist. It’s outrageous. Are we really content to live like this? Pictured: a seahorse clinging on to a cotton bud with its tailWe live in a beautiful country and we have all probably done something to disfigure it. We are lucky that nature is forgiving. But the strange contradiction of plastic is that while most of it is intended for temporary use, it can live on for centuries.Research has established that if you allow litter to accumulate, not only does it cost us all a fortune to remove, but it affects our behaviour. A litter-strewn environment makes depression more likely. And when a place is mucky, crime and anti-social behaviour get worse, as if those with bad intent are uneasy in places which are cared for.If you think about all this long enough, you could get awfully depressed. But we have not yet reached the point of no return. We don’t have to live like this. We can still make a start on clearing it up.It is abundantly clear that the only thing that will achieve a lasting improvement is ‘behavioural change’.Once upon a time, people thought nothing of having ‘one for the road’ and driving home legless. We need a similar change of attitudes in this case, so that the idea of dropping litter — and especially plastic litter — would never enter people’s heads.Before we can do that, we need to recognise the seriousness of the problem, which is rooted in the fact that some people just don’t see litter.Above all, though, we need to tackle the problem of plastic. We can all make a difference: we could start the next time we have a coffee by refusing any single-use plastic container.And we have to start making a noise.Someone (are you listening, Michael Gove?) needs to take responsibility for the unglamorous job of cleaning up this place.There is virtually no evidence that the Government takes litter seriously. Highways England has a statutory duty to ‘keep highways clear of litter’. It isn’t doing so, but there is no sign that any minister is prepared to lift a finger.How many times have you seen a waste lorry driving along, as bits of rubbish fly out of the back? It happens every week.Fifty years ago, this problem did not exist. It’s outrageous. Are we really content to live like this?Jeremy Paxman is Patron of Clean Up Britain. "},{"url":null,"title":"Woman gave birth four babies using IVF feeds 224 bottles milk WEEK","story":"    Tracey Britten, 51, is the UK’s oldest mother to give birth to quadruplets. She is pictured with, left to right, George, Grace and twins Fredrica and FrancescaHowever demanding your week has been, spare a thought for Tracey Britten, the UK’s oldest mother to give birth to quadruplets.Over the past seven days, Tracey, 51, has fed her babies 224 bottles of formula milk, changed 168 nappies, dressed her offspring 56 times and dished out 28 baths, all on less than three hours’ sleep a night.While her husband Stephen, 39, mucks in when he’s home, he works full-time, so she can perhaps be excused for not having washed her hair for six weeks — and only taking the quads outdoors on her own once since they came home from hospital last month.‘You do have moments late at night when you think: “Oh my God, what have I done?” admits Tracey, who is alone with the babies for up to 12 hours a day. ‘It’s hard graft. But then, quick as a flash, I think: “It’s only for a few months — they will be able to feed themselves soon.”‘I don’t regret it. I wouldn’t have had them if I didn’t want them — and it will get easier.‘Some people may think it’s selfish to become a mum again at my age, but I don’t worry about not being around to see my babies grow up. I’m fit and healthy and look after myself, so I fully expect to live long enough to see my grandchildren.‘I may be the oldest mum at the school gates, but who cares? Most women are leaving it later to have kids nowadays, and people always tell me I look much younger than I am.’          Tracey and Stephen had IVF treatment in Cyprus and admits she was dumbfounded, when she saw the scan, pictured, asking the sonographer: ‘How am I going to cope with four babies?’She does indeed look younger than her years, but one can’t help but wonder how she will cope with the challenge once her babies start crawling in four different directions.Her three little girls and a boy were delivered by Caesarean section, 31 weeks into her pregnancy, at London’s University College Hospital on October 26 last year.Tracey and Stephen had travelled overseas for IVF treatment at the Team Miracle Cyprus IVF Centre, in what was a final roll of the dice after ten years of trying for a baby. It was their first attempt at IVF, and cost £7,000.In all, four embryos were implanted into Tracey’s womb three survived, one of which split into two, creating identical twin girls.Tracey was already a mother to three grown-up children — a daughter and two sons — and grandmother to eight, aged between 11 and one, while Stephen, a roofer, has a teenage son.The couple’s desperate desire to become parents again was, admits Tracey, rooted in the guilt and trauma she felt after having a late abortion, aged 39, because the ‘timing wasn’t right for a baby’.          Tracey, pictured while pregnant with the quads, is also a mother to her three grown-up children and grandmother to eightShe deeply regretted the termination, carried out when she was 19 weeks pregnant, and sank into a depression. This was compounded when her beloved mother, Pauline, died unexpectedly six weeks later, due to a blockage in the main artery to her heart.Tracey convinced herself this was karma, a punishment for ending her unborn son’s life. Shortly after her 50th birthday, Tracey decided to use the cash her late mother had left in her will to fund IVF treatment in Cyprus, where the clinic implanted four embryos at once, which doctors said would maximise her chances of conceiving — a strategy that is not permitted in the UK to prevent risky multiple births.Although Tracey knew it was a possibility, she admits she burst into tears after discovering she was carrying quads at her nine-week scan.Dumbfounded, she asked the sonographer: ‘How am I going to cope with four babies?’Two weeks later, Tracey, who has a history of premature labour, developed severe stomach pains. She went to her local hospital, where doctors advised her to ‘reduce’ the pregnancy by having two of the foetuses injected in the womb to stop their hearts.This, she was told, would increase the remaining two babies’ chances of survival. But Tracey had bonded with her quads, after seeing them in numerous scans, and could not contemplate saying goodbye to any of them. Her decision to ‘let nature take its course’ paid off, and the quads — George, Grace and twins Fredrica and Francesca — are now 12 weeks old.At birth, George was the heaviest at 3lb 10oz, Francesca was 2lb 12oz, Grace 2lb 7oz and Fredrica a tiny 1lb 15oz.When I arrive at the family’s three-bedroom bungalow in North London, I fully expect to be greeted by a dishevelled Tracey surrounded by bottles, nappies, baby wipes, vomit-streaked muslin cloths and a cacophony of screaming.Oh fox it!

I tried not to let anything stress me. and if I did feel stressed I put on some meditation music.‘Of course, I knew it wouldn’t be easy, but I decided to just take each day as it comes.’As Tracey puts the kettle on to make us tea (I offer, but she insists!) I notice a long, handwritten list on the kitchen counter detailing all the times each baby has been fed using miniature bottles of prescription-only formula, designed for premature infants. A peek inside the fridge reveals 24 more bottles lined up ready for the day ahead.‘We had to start writing everything down, because in the early days we’d forget which ones had been fed,’ says Tracey. ‘We kept the hospital name tags on their ankles, too, so we could tell them apart. We couldn’t always be sure, especially in the dead of night.‘Now we can tell who’s who at a glance, partly because Fredrica is smaller than Francesca and the other two look different.’          Tracey has fed her babies 224 bottles of formula milk over the past seven days. Pictured is the mother on This Morning with Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield The quads spent six weeks in incubators and there were setbacks, including George catching flu at two weeks and Fredrica struggling to digest her tube-fed formula milk.George also has reflux for which he has been prescribed Gaviscon, which makes him constipated.Still, three of them were allowed home on December 8, two days before Tracey’s 51st birthday, while Fredrica was finally feeding well enough to join her siblings a week before Christmas, at nearly eight weeks old. They now sleep two to a cot beside their parents’ double bed. By the time they move into the nursery, at around six months old, Tracey is hoping to buy two twin cots so that they can all fit comfortably into one room.While prematurity and low birth weight are risk factors for numerous conditions, including cerebral palsy, vision problems and hearing loss, the quads appear to be healthy and reaching their milestones. Doctors at the Whittington Hospital in North London will keep an eye on their development, as difficulties are not always obvious so early on.Luckily for their parents, the babies rarely cry all at once — except for the evening they had their eight-week injections: ‘They were obviously in pain and cried all night,’ Tracey recalls.‘Thankfully, they were fine the following day.’Last week, however, Tracey went 24 hours without closing her eyes, because at least one baby was crying for attention throughout that time.‘I had to keep moving, rocking them and doing jobs, because I knew if I sat still I would nod off,’ she says. ‘Usually they sleep for about four or five hours in the daytime, and I should really take that opportunity to rest, too, but I’ve got so much to do: making up bottles, laundry, cleaning, making the beds and cots. By the time I’ve done all that, it’s feeding and winding time again.‘It’s hard to describe what it’s like, to be honest. It sometimes feels as though I’m having an out-of-body experience and watching someone else do it.’Keeping on top of all this would be a huge challenge for any mother, but for a woman in her sixth decade — with a touch of arthritis and a bad back — it sounds crippling.But while admitting she is utterly exhausted, Tracey claims that, in some ways, she is coping better than she did as a young mum.‘Obviously, it’s a lot harder than when I had just one baby at a time,’ she says. ‘But I’m older now and have more patience. I was only 18 when I had my eldest daughter and you think you’re missing out on things at that age.‘Everyone is going out and telling you what a great time they’re having, but I’ve done all that now.’Still, these days most of her contemporaries are enjoying precious leisure time as their children become self-sufficient, while Tracey will be 68 before her quads come of age.But she appears to have a remarkable ability not to project her thoughts beyond the here and now — a quality she believes is at the root of her babies’ easy-going temperaments.Having raised ‘three good kids’, she’s not worried about coping with teenagers in her 60s, either.At 39, Stephen is more than a decade younger than his wife and a very capable, hands-on dad who, despite having to be up for work at 5am, is in charge of grocery shopping and cooking dinner.But there was one day recently when Stephen left for work and Tracey realised he’d forgotten to buy milk for her tea.The prospect of 12 hours in sole charge of four babies without caffeine was too much to bear, so Tracey decided to wheel them to the local shop.It took her 20 minutes to assemble the pram, then another 20 minutes to get the babies into their warm snow suits and strapped in.The ten-minute walk stretched into half an hour as one passerby after another stopped to look into the pram and ask questions. That was the first and last time Tracey — who says the weight of the pram put a strain on her bad back — has ventured out with them alone.So when any of the quads has a medical appointment, Stephen, who has a very understanding boss, must take a day off work to drive them there. Tracey can’t take all the babies as their special pram will not fit into the family’s Ford Galaxy — they are looking for a second-hand Mercedes Viano.When anyone refers to him as ‘the proud father’, Stephen jovially replies: ‘Exhausted father, more like. My mates at work tease me about how long it’ll be before I can have a night out with them again.‘But I don’t want to go out,’ he adds. ‘The idea of getting home after a few drinks and having to do the night shift, or coping with four babies when you’ve got a hangover is too awful.‘The tiredness is the hardest thing — when you know you’ve got to be up for work and you’ve had no sleep.‘At the moment, all they need is to be fed and cleaned but when they start running around it might be trickier.’Although Stephen must keep bringing home the bacon — the nappy bill alone comes to nearly £100 a month, that doesn’t mean he gets to put his feet up at the end of a working day. ‘He’ll say: “I’m going to have a soak in the bath”, and I’ll say: “Never mind that, be quick and come and see to these bloody kids — I’ve no time for a soak,” ’ says Tracey, laughing throatily.‘I even shout to hurry up when he’s in the loo, and he complains he can’t sit on the couch because there are babies on every cushion.’Being constantly on the move means Tracey regained her figure in record time, and was able to fit back into her size 12 jeans two weeks after giving birth.She certainly doesn’t look like a woman who gave birth to quads less than three months ago.She is also relieved that, despite criticism levelled at her while pregnant — she was called ‘selfish’ for having IVF at 50, resulting in quads whose care is ‘likely to cost the NHS hundreds of thousands of pounds’ — public opinion since the birth has been much more supportive.Her one regret is that her babies aren’t getting the one-to-one attention she was able to give her older children.‘With one, you can cuddle them all the time,’ she says. ‘But at the hospital they told me to put them down after each feed so they don’t get too used to being held and cry when they’re laid down — I’ve only got one pair of arms.‘Instead, if they’re all awake I put cartoons on the TV and face their bouncy chairs towards it.’Using television to distract infants may go against normal parenting advice, but it’s clear that Tracey — who’s hoping for recognition as Britain’s oldest mum of quads in the Guinness Book of Records — will have little time in the foreseeable future to worry about social conventions."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/25/15/05D7C693000007D0-0-image-m-22_1548429200626.jpg","title":"Amazon planning build physical shops South England","story":"    The online giant has invited bids from potential partners to find retail space for its Amazon Go stores in the South of England (file picture)Customers use the Amazon Go app, and any items they take from the shelves are added to a ‘virtual trolley’ which is automatically charged to their Amazon account when they leave the store. Machine learning and ‘computer vision’ detect when items are removed from the shelf.Treasury Minister warns the EU could block moves to impose...Revealed: Jeff Bezos and mistress Lauren Sanchez took the...Share this articleIn the first move to bring Amazon-branded shops to the UK, the company issued a request for retail estate brokers in October and selected a representative later the same month, the documents suggest.

This year we want TEN TIMES as many, and it couldn\u0027t be easier to sign up By LOUISE ATKINSON for the Daily Mail Today the Mail is proud to announce our national campaign to get Britain picking up plastic litter is back — and bigger and better than ever.The plastic pick-up — in partnership with charity Keep Britain Tidy, and endorsed by a host of naturalists including David Attenborough, the Prime Minister and even the UN — was a phenomenal success last year and a credit to our wonderful army of dedicated readers who made a real difference.More than 20,000 people filled 17,000 wheelie bins with rubbish and picked up two million plastic bottles for recycling over one weekend.          WEST YORKSHIRE. No sign of life: A very optimistic fisherman on the banks of the plastic-clogged River Calder at Stanley FerryBut there’s more to be done. The scourge of plastic is still infesting our streets. Taxpayers spend £800 million every year to clear up after thoughtless litter louts and fly-tippers, and the system is struggling to cope.That’s why this year we are supporting The Great British Spring Clean — which will take place between March 22 and April 23 — and are asking you to join with friends, family, colleagues, schools and faith groups to tackle the blight and turn the tide on plastic.Last year, 370,000 people took part in the Spring Clean. We hope to have half a million people picking up plastic this year. You can make such a difference by sparing just a few hours to pick up plastic in your area.Schools can also do their part and there’s even fantastic prizes to be won (see box below) — turn to pages 8 and 9 to see how two of last year’s winners used theirs.To sign up, just log on to gbspringclean.org.

FROM THIS: By the end of the day, they had recorded a massive 27 bags of rubbish and nine of recyclable plastic          TO THIS: We did it! Kate Copeland (with wheelbarrow) and friends at the new eco-centre. The group built an eco-centre in the town, which opened in November 2018Kate says: ‘While we wait for the machinery to arrive, we are getting the workshop ready and building up quite a substantial collection of plastic ready to be shredded.’The team plan to sell the products they make and put the money towards funding a course for the community on recycling, litter-picking and plastic disposal.‘Our aim is to raise awareness so that we can keep the whole of Staffordshire clear of litter and waste plastic,’ says Kate. ‘The Mail’s campaign really galvanised the community.’  Our school trip to meet penguins- and Chris PackhamLast year, the Mail offered a fabulous prize to the best school involved with the Great Plastic Pick Up. It was tough to pick just one from the 150 entrants.But, ultimately, one stood out for its incredible efforts. As well as collecting 20 bags of rubbish for the Great Plastic Pick Up last year, the children from Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, regularly go on litter-picks.So, on September 12, 88 children jumped on buses provided by the Daily Mail for a trip to the National Sea Life Centre in Birmingham, escorted by TV naturalist and wildlife campaigner Chris Packham.           Chris Packham sat with the children as they ate their packed lunches and took the chance to point out items of single-use plastic they had with them. ‘I hid my plastic drinks bottle so Chris didn’t see it,’ confessed one pupil‘We were so thrilled when we found out we’d won,’ says teacher Kerry Wheatley. ‘There was a real buzz in the school.’The children met Chris and heard him give a talk on plastic pollution and its impact on marine life. He then joined them in touring the site, chatting as they walked through the glass ‘ocean tunnel’ and watched penguins being fed.For 11-year-old Keiran, it was a dream come true. ‘My mum calls me Dr Dolittle because I’m so obsessed with animals,’ he says. I was very excited to visit Sea Life. We saw turtles, angelfish and even sharks!’ He and Chris appear to have got on famously. ‘We talked a lot about sharks and he told me that octopuses don’t have teeth, but use their really sharp beaks to eat,’ says Keiran. ‘My best bit was when he told me that parrotfish make a bubble of snot to deter their predators.’Chris sat with the children as they ate their packed lunches and took the chance to point out items of single-use plastic they had with them. ‘I hid my plastic drinks bottle so Chris didn’t see it,’ confessed one pupil.          As well as collecting 20 bags of rubbish for the Great Plastic Pick Up last year, the children from Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, regularly go on litter-picksFollowing the trip, the teachers encouraged pupils to practise their writing by sending letters to Costa Coffee, highlighting the evils of single-use coffee cups to the local cinema (which doesn’t recycle its plastic) and to the council, to request more bins in the town. They also wrote to Sea Life, thanking it for the visit and pointing out how the amount of plastic used in food packaging at the attraction could be reduced.‘The event really changed things here,’ says teacher Gary Smith. ‘We’ve had plastic recycling bins put in the classrooms and staffroom and invited the council in to talk to the children about the cost of clearing up litter.’‘You can be sure that we will be preparing to get our litter-pickers out once more for the Great British Spring Clean to help make Ilkeston look great!’  New safest steps for a slippery pathThe sands at Tregantle in south east Cornwall are a favourite dog-walking spot for 35-year-old Craig Brook-Hewitt — but the beach’s proximity to Plymouth means plastic rubbish from the town and out at sea is continually being washed ashore.Craig says: ‘In the Great Plastic Pick Up last May, we cleared 45 bags of rubbish, some two tons of plastic rope and masses of fishing equipment.’This impressed the Keep Britain Tidy judges, who awarded the crew a £10,000 prize. Craig and his team plan to use the cash to make beach access safer, with steps and handrails along a stretch of the slippery access path, and to install seagull-proof bins made from recycled plastic.

You may, perhaps, have heard of his brother, the painter Andrew Wyeth, who is far more likely to pop up in a University Challenge question than his geeky sibling.If you are a real enthusiast for American art, you may even have heard of his artist father or his artist sisters. But it is the quiet scientist, Nathaniel, who has had the biggest impact on the planet.Nathaniel Wyeth used to call himself ‘the unknown one’, to mark out his obscurity in comparison with his famous artist family. He spent most of his adult life as a research scientist drone in a multinational chemical company.And in doing that he changed all our lives.You can spend your whole life in contented ignorance of his family’s paintings. But you will assuredly see uncountable numbers of Nathaniel’s contribution to modern life.For while The Beatles were recording Sergeant Pepper in 1967, Nathaniel Wyatt was wondering whether fizzy drinks could be carried around in lightweight containers. It took him a few years in a DuPont lab to get the design and chemical formula right, but by 1973 he had invented and patented the plastic bottle.Nathaniel Wyatt retired soon after, having given the world a sort of freedom. And how we loved it!One of the characteristics of modern life is how much of it is lived on the move.‘Shall I grab us a couple of coffees?’ a colleague shouts, before returning with a disposable container which magically doesn’t leak. If you have time for them, lunches are eaten in cars, supper is a sandwich on a train.Plastic bottles, plastic tops and linings to coffee cups and plastic wrappings on food make life liveable. Last year alone, we used more than 13 billion plastic bottles in Britain.          We have somehow turned this useful substance into a blight on the planet which is doing far more damage than machine guns ever did. Pictured: A seal who got a plastic frisbee stuck around her neck, causing a deep incisionThere is nothing inherently wrong with synthetic plastic. When the Victorian scientist Alexander Parkes invented the first man-made plastic he wasn’t setting out to make a killing machine, like his fellow resident of South Norwood cemetery, Hiram Maxim, creator of the machine gun.But we have somehow turned this useful substance into a blight on the planet which is doing far more damage than machine guns ever did.Once upon a time, plastic was full of promise. It was cheap and light and could be made into just about any shape. It was waterproof and protected food from contamination. In the early days, it was even seen as an instrument of female liberation because women no longer needed some simian male to lift things for them.How did it all go wrong?It didn’t happen by chance. We made it go wrong, because we’re stupid and idle and thoughtless. It’s too easy to blame manufacturers of sweet, fizzy drinks for the problem.For sure, we should all do something to persuade the dimwits at drink companies to think of containers that won’t trouble our great-grandchildren. If Coca-Cola is part of the problem, it’s unlikely to be part of the solution.But litter isn’t their problem. It’s ours. It is not the manufacturers who chuck the empty bottles onto the roadside. It is us. Someone you know is almost certainly an anti-social yob. It’s reckoned that over half of Britain’s plastic bottles end up being recycled. Which means that nearly half of them are not. Billions of plastic bottles are, therefore, being tipped into the ground, burned, or left to contaminate the countryside.          How did it all go wrong? It didn’t happen by chance. We made it go wrong, because we’re stupid and idle and thoughtless. Pictured: A mallard duck entangled in plastic in Richmond Park, south west LondonThink back to the places you loved as a child — fields, hills, rivers or parks. If you experienced them before Dr Wyeth made his discovery in the Sixties, you probably recall them looking much the same as they had for generations. Perhaps for centuries.Today, unless you are lucky enough to have a conscientious local authority or team of litter volunteers, the place you fondly remember is likely to be strewn with rubbish. Beauty spots have an odd effect on some people, causing them to create ugliness. Weirdly, homo sapiens seems to have developed an urge to foul his own nest.We have all seen the photos of dogs, cats, turtles suffering pain or starvation after being snared or poisoned by waste plastics, whether bottles, jars, fishing nets or even, sometimes, fibres of plastic so small that they are virtually invisible to the human eye. We may not kill them intentionally, yet as a species we do it anyway.Plastic on the ground gets washed into watercourses and then rivers, and from there into the sea. Those plastic bottles along the tide-line at your favourite beach could have come from more-or-less anywhere.In fact, last year, a Mail investigation, headlined ‘Dustbin of the World’, revealed that plastic items washed up on a Cornish beach had come from as far afield as North Korea and Florida.Not only that, one toy plastic ship discovered in the Arctic recently started life in a British cereal packet in 1958 — proof, if proof were needed, that plastic is designed to be well-nigh indestructible. That’s why areas like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an enormous expanse of ocean roughly twice the size of France, survives from year to year, with rubbish washing from one side of the ocean to the other. And that is just what we can see.Plastic pollution is now so widespread that, as Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King’s College, London, revealed in the Mail only a few months ago, we are now all breathing in microscopic particles of plastic, with no idea of what they may be doing to us.Environmentalists often sound like their own worst enemies, because they have spent so long crying ‘wolf’ that one might as well grind their sandals to dust and mould them into earplugs.So what if they predict — as they do — that within 30 years there will be a greater volume of plastic in the sea than there will be fish? Perhaps they’re right, but we cannot comprehend it, simply because we have never before had to live with detritus that goes on more-or-less for ever. As a mere citizen, it reduces you to a feeling of utter powerlessness.If you bought a packet of peanuts in the Sixties, they came in a paper bag. Now, the bag is coated with plastic. The manufacturers have chosen to do it for understandable reasons — it keeps the peanuts inside dry and clean. But the plastic remains virtually indestructible, and we seem to have no choice in that.If we have a sudden craving for peanuts, our grandchildren will be living with the container long after we are providing food for worms. The snack we enjoyed was gone in minutes. We didn’t buy the packet as some sort of legacy gift, but the wrapping it came in will be there for decades.And it is not just self-righteous environmentalists in shapeless jumpers who predict Armageddon. Common sense tells us that if every year increasing quantities of this toxic material end up lying about the place, then sooner or later it will engulf us. There is trouble ahead.I cannot do anything about the plastic bags which litter the deserts of the Middle East or the bottles, drainpipes and jars that float down the Yangtze River in China.But I can do something about the garbage that is piling up at the sides of British highways. I can begin by not adding to it.The other day, walking half a mile on a country lane six miles from the nearest town, I picked up four plastic bottles, two McDonald’s wrappers, two fish-and-chip shop styrofoam trays, six chocolate wrappers, three cigarette packets, two plastic hubcaps, the back of a mobile phone, assorted bits of unidentifiable junk and a plastic doll’s leg.Doubtless, there was some story attached to each of the items. Collectively, they tell no story beyond the contamination of the countryside.We have all seen morons throwing trash from their cars. Why do they do it? Presumably they do it because they don’t want it in their cars. But they are too stupid to understand that jettisoning it from their vehicle merely means that it becomes a problem for everyone, and that everyone includes them.          Fifty years ago, this problem did not exist. It’s outrageous. Are we really content to live like this? Pictured: a seahorse clinging on to a cotton bud with its tailWe live in a beautiful country and we have all probably done something to disfigure it. We are lucky that nature is forgiving. But the strange contradiction of plastic is that while most of it is intended for temporary use, it can live on for centuries.Research has established that if you allow litter to accumulate, not only does it cost us all a fortune to remove, but it affects our behaviour. A litter-strewn environment makes depression more likely. And when a place is mucky, crime and anti-social behaviour get worse, as if those with bad intent are uneasy in places which are cared for.If you think about all this long enough, you could get awfully depressed. But we have not yet reached the point of no return. We don’t have to live like this. We can still make a start on clearing it up.It is abundantly clear that the only thing that will achieve a lasting improvement is ‘behavioural change’.Once upon a time, people thought nothing of having ‘one for the road’ and driving home legless. We need a similar change of attitudes in this case, so that the idea of dropping litter — and especially plastic litter — would never enter people’s heads.Before we can do that, we need to recognise the seriousness of the problem, which is rooted in the fact that some people just don’t see litter.Above all, though, we need to tackle the problem of plastic. We can all make a difference: we could start the next time we have a coffee by refusing any single-use plastic container.And we have to start making a noise.Someone (are you listening, Michael Gove?) needs to take responsibility for the unglamorous job of cleaning up this place.There is virtually no evidence that the Government takes litter seriously. Highways England has a statutory duty to ‘keep highways clear of litter’. It isn’t doing so, but there is no sign that any minister is prepared to lift a finger.How many times have you seen a waste lorry driving along, as bits of rubbish fly out of the back? It happens every week.Fifty years ago, this problem did not exist. It’s outrageous. Are we really content to live like this?Jeremy Paxman is Patron of Clean Up Britain. "},{"url":null,"title":"Ellen Barkin calls Hollywood supporting Bryan Singer smearing accusers","story":"Breaking the silence: Ellen Barkin (left) returned to Twitter to call out Hollywood following the news that Bryan Singer (right) would still collect his $10M paycheck for Red Sonja          Calling it out: \u0027And so Hollywood continues to protect its own, pedophiles and predators...cuz *birds of a feather*,\u0027 wrote Barkin          Singing Singer\u0027s praises: On Thursday, studio head Avi Lerner (above) released a statement supporting Singer and calling these latest allegations of underage rape \u0027agenda driven fake news\u0027The Hollywood stars who have worked with Singer along with those who launched the Time\u0027s Up movement chose to stay silent however, with Time\u0027s Up not even commenting on the allegations of sexual abuse until 36 hours after The Atlantic released its expose.     Not Barkin however, who for the past 18 months has been steadfast in her support of those accusing Hollywood heavyweights of sexual abuse and harassment, especially at times when her peers are afraid to speak out.This was certainly the case in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein allegations, when Barkin was one of just a handful of stars to call out the accused predator in the days after The New York Times released its first of many exposes about the disgraced mogul.  Olivia Munn, another outspoken advocate for sexual misconduct victims,  also retweeted  the expose on Wednesday, a risky mov for the actress given her role in the Singer-produced X-Men franchise.Meanwhile, Rami Malek did his best to avoid comment in an interview celebration his Oscar nomination for Singer\u0027s mos recent film, Bohemian Rhapsody. He did admit to the Los Angeles Times that he secured the role of Freddy Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody a year before Singer came on board, and said the allegations \u0027were, believe it or not, honestly something I was not aware of, and that is what it is.\u0027 Polygamous leaders of incestuous, white power cult bought...Share this articleThe Atlantic published the expose one day after Oscar voters awarded the director\u0027s latest film, Bohemian Rhapsody, with five Oscar nominations.Singer is also still set to be paid $10 million to direct the upcoming film Red Sonja, whose title character is survivor of sexual abuse. Meanwhile, the writers revealed that they took the story to The Atlantic after it was killed by Hearst executives, despite having been approved for publication by the company\u0027s lawyers. Hearst did not respond to a request for comment. Writers Maximillian Potter and Alex French released a statement about the expose on Wednesday. \u0027We have been asked why a story reported and written by two Esquire writers is being published in The Atlantic,\u0027 it read.\u0027This story began with our editors at Esquire. After months of reporting, this story went through Esquire\u0027s editorial process, which included fact-checking and vetting by a Hearst attorney, and the story was approved for publication.\u0027The men then added: \u0027The story was then killed by Hearst executives. We do not know why.\u0027          Anyway the wind blows: Bohemian Rhapsody star Rami Malek claimed that the allegations \u0027were, believe it or not, honestly something I was not aware of, and that is what it is\u0027 (Singer and Malek above on the set of Rhapsody with Ben Hardy and Queen drummer Roger Taylor)          Silent film stars: \u0027With Bohemian Rhapsody being an award-winning hit, this homophobic smear piece has been conveniently timed to take advantage of its success,\u0027 said Singer(above with Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender in 2015)Singer has been aware for months that a story was in the works, and commented on the planned expose around the time it was killed.\u0027The last time I posted about this subject, Esquire magazine was preparing to publish an article written by a homophobic journalist who has a bizarre obsession with me dating back to 1997,\u0027 aid Singer.\u0027After careful fact-checking and, in consideration of the lack of credible sources, Esquire chose not to publish this piece of vendetta journalism.\u0027He then wet on to call the story of homophobic. \u0027That didn\u0027t stop this writer from selling it to The Atlantic. It\u0027s sad that The Atlantic would stoop to this low standard of journalistic integrity,\u0027 said Singer.\u0027Again, I am forced to reiterate that this story rehashes claims from bogus lawsuits filed by a disreputable cast of iniduals willing to lie for money or attention. And it is no surprise that, with Bohemian Rhapsody being an award-winning hit, this homophobic smear piece has been conveniently timed to take advantage of its success.\u0027Four new men have come forward to share their stories, which are remarkably similar to those shared by a number of men in the past.The youngest accuser claims that he was just 13 when Singer molested him on a film set, while others recount being plied with drugs and alcohol before being led to a bedroom by the director.That youngest victim said that as he watched the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfold, he started to thing: \u0027Me too—only I was a kid.\u0027Among the men speaking out is Victor Valdovinos, who claims that he was 13 when Singer, then in his 30s, molested him on the set of Apt Pupil.He claims that Singer first approached him in a bathroom at his school, and then asked him to be in the film. Valdovinos arrived on the set the next day only to be told to strip, put on a towel and then hidden away in a room.   \u0027I’m hanging out. All of a sudden, Bryan comes in. He goes, ‘Hey! How are you? Real cheerful. And I’m like, Hi,\u0027 said Valdovinos.           Him too: A British John Doe (above) who claims Singer raped him in London \u0027I can’t remember his exact words, but he was kind of just saying Come back here. He kind of directs me he kind of grabs me and he takes us to the back area, which was kind of closed off. \u0027He went on to say: \u0027I was back here, in the towel, with no shirt and no clothes on, sitting on one of the locker-room benches. Bryan’s like, Just hang out here. It’s going to be all day. Don’t worry.\u0027Singer allegedly paid multiple visits to the seventh-grade student throughout the day.\u0027Every time he had a chance - three times - he would go back there\u0027 claimed Valdoinos. \u0027He was always touching my chest.\u0027Then, at one point, Singer allegedly \u0027grabbed my genitals and started masturbating it\u0027 and then \u0027rubbed his front part on me,.\u0027Valdoinos said: \u0027He did it all with this smile.\u0027He also allegedly told the boy: \u0027You’re so good-looking … I really want to work with you … I have a nice Ferrari … I’m going to take care of you.\u0027Valdoinos said he was \u0027frozen speechless,\u0027 and alleged that Singer returned three times throughout the day. Within a few years he was a father after getting his teenage girlfriend pregnant, and went from being an Honor\u0027s student to failing his classes. He dropped out, was arrested on battery and drug possession charges, and eventually served time in prison.\u0027What if he never did this to me—would I be a different person?

Would I be married?\u0027 wondered Valdoinos.   Alleged victim: One of the accusers alleged that Singer had a relationship with the late actor Brad Renfro (left in Singer\u0027s 1998 film Apt Pupil), right being arrested for trying to purchase heroin in 2005)          Firing back: Singer has denied all allegations of rape, molestation, or engaging in inappropriate contact with a minor (Singer above with former lover Bret Tyler)          The allegations against Singer were first reported back in 2014 when Michael Egan (above) accused the director of rape.Another accuser, who did not want to use his real name, said he was kicked out of his home at 16 because he was gay, and that was how he came to meet Singer. They made out once when he was 16 said the accuser, who also alleged that the pair  had oral sex when he was 17 or 18 at one of Singer\u0027s parties. \u0027He would stick his hands down your pants without your consent,\u0027 he claimed. \u0027He was predatory in that he would ply people with alcohol and drugs and then have sex with them.\u0027Another accuser, referred to as Andy, said he came to meet Singer after he was allegedly raped by Marc Collins-Rector multiple times. That all started when Andy was just 14, and he claims that was soon being flown on private planes to see Rector from his home in Las Vegas. He met Singer at a party while the director was with Brad Renfro, who passed away in 2008 at the age of 25 from a heroin overdose.The three men went to a room, where Andy alleges he was raped by Singer.\u0027Bryan knew I was 15,\u0027 said Andy.\u0027I remember wanting Brad to join in. I don’t think Brad was gay, or even bi. I think he was going with the flow. We talked about it. Like me, he looked around at all of the things these guys had, all of the money. Maybe he thought the guys were going to do things for him.\u0027He also claimed that Singer did not try and hide what as happening in the room. \u0027I just remember how loud the moaning was. I remember thinking, God, there’s a big group of people downstairs hanging out in the living room, and they can probably hear him,\u0027 aid Andy. \u0027That bothered me, so I stuck my hand over his mouth or in his mouth just to stop it. When we went downstairs, it was really awkward. I just acted like it was no big thing.\u0027This happened a few more times he claimed, and a few years later Singer allegedly lost interest in Andy. He began to abuse drugs, and would come to call on Singer for money at times.Andy eventually checked into court-ordered rehab however and has now been clean for two years. \u0027I sort of wonder, if I’d never met Marc and then Bryan, if I would have ever got into the drugs,\u0027 said Andy.          No idea: The producers and actors who worked on Bohemian Rhapsody claim that they were unaware of the allegations against Singer (cast and crew above accepting the Golden Globe for Best Picture)          Accuser: Victor Valdovinos (above) claims that he was 13 when Singer, then in his 30s, molested him on the set of Apt PupilEric, who also asked that his name be withheld, alleged that he was just 17 when he had sex with a 31-year-old Singer.He claimed that Singer was surrounded by two types of young men.\u0027If you weren’t young and cute enough to be their boy, you could still ingratiate yourself by bringing boys to them,\u0027 he said of Singer and his cohorts. They had a sexual relationship for five years according to Eric, until Singer lost interest in him.\u0027I never want people to think of me as a victim, so I always put up the front of I’m good. I was in charge,\u0027 said Eric.\u0027But I spent a decade in therapy trying to figure out if what happened was bad or not bad. And if it was bad, was it my fault? What I’ve decided is that adults are supposed to look out for kids.\u0027He also said that he is now in Alcoholic\u0027s Anonymous, where he allegedly runs into a number of Singer\u0027s former boys. \u0027There’s a bunch of us\u0027 he said.\u0027It’s like, You were one of Singer’s boys? Me too.\u0027 Gabe Hoffman of An Open Secret also responded to the allegations, telling DailyMail.com: \u0027In October 2018, after Bryan Singer\u0027s false attack on Alex and Max\u0027s work - I personally offered to buy, insure, and bankroll the story if Esquire ever did not want it.

On the US version, its B-side was a makeweight piece titled “The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man”, which directed sneering contempt on some poor unfortunate who worked for the group’s record label: “I promo groups when they come into town  Well they laugh at my toupee, they’re sure to put me down.”Thus began a lineage of rock songs founded on the eternal contradiction between the artistic impulse and the hucksterish, often seedy ways of the music business. This reached a peak of fury and cynicism in the era of punk with the Sex Pistols’ gloriously incoherent classic “EMI”, in which John Lydon vents his rage at the company that put out the group’s first single in 1976, only to dump them. “It’s an unlimited supply,” he spits. “And there is no reason why  I tell you it was all a frame  They only did it ’cos of fame  Who?  EMI!”Electric and Musical Industries was founded in 1931. Its activities included innovative work on TV and radar technology, but it became part of millions of lives via its role as a music company, split between such labels as Parlophone, Columbia and His Master’s Voice. As rock’n’roll unfolded, its culture often seemed comically stuffy (at the company’s renowned Abbey Road studios, recording engineers had to wear white lab coats). But EMI’s place at the core of global pop culture was assured when, in 1962, George Martin signed the Beatles to Parlophone, and the group subsequently posed for the cover of their debut album in among the modernist geometry of EMI’s HQ at Manchester Square, in central London, grinning from ear to ear.Forty years later, things at EMI were not nearly as cheerful. The company had enjoyed a good 1990s, putting out big-sellers by Blur and Radiohead and eventually signing Coldplay. But it was in debt, and the commercial climate was growing chilly. Thrown by illicit music-sharing on the internet and the resulting decline in sales of CDs, record companies were amalgamating at speed. EMI was lonely and vulnerable, and in August 2007, it was bought for £4.2bn – £2.6bn of which was borrowed from the US bank Citigroup – by a private equity firm called Terra Firma. Its new owners were headed by Guy Hands, described by the Evening Standard as “a dishevelled six-footer with an unkempt bouffant and tombstone teeth”.Eamonn Forde has been writing about the music industry for nearly 20 years. Though slightly sullied by an opening section that spurns laying out the reasons why EMI was a household name in favour of business arcana, his account of what happened next is an addictive blend of tragedy, comedy and insight. One of Hands’s first pronouncements about EMI points to the farce that was about to happen: “We look for the worst businesses we can find in the most challenged sector – and we get happy if it’s really, really bad … We’re just hoping EMI is as bad as we think it is.”Terra Firma had a few good ideas but, on the whole, it embodied the kind of mind-boggling business culture that had gained steam through the 90s. Hands insisted EMI was initially examined by the obligatory management consultants, including KPMG and McKinsey. Its first months in charge of the company were marked by a very New Labour-ish internal PR war: “all these different comms teams briefing and … counter-briefing against each other”. There is a horrible inevitability to the arrival in the story of the former BBC director general and former Tony Blair adviser John Birt, who appears to have strode around EMI dispensing advice on the basis of nothing much at all.Hands seems to have had no idea about the sensitive, often neurotic psychologies of musicians, nor how to at least give the appearance of art remaining on a par with commerce. He and his accomplices thought they might be able to turn Abbey Road into a “multi-dimensional visitor centre”, where tourists could gawp at musicians at work through one-way mirrors. They floated the idea of Coldplay electric toothbrushes that would play the band’s hit song “Yellow”, and supplying cut-price Beatles albums to garden centres. One insider baldly told Kylie Minogue’s manager that the key to her success was simple: “Just put her in the gold hot pants again.”It couldn’t last – and it didn’t. In the wake of the fall of Lehman Brothers, Citigroup’s plan to follow the financial fashions of the time and slice up EMI’s debt and sell it in parcels to other investors came to grief, and as Hands’s plans for the company’s revival foundered, the bank bought EMI outright. There followed an epic legal battle between the bank and Terra Firma over whether Citigroup had tricked Hands into buying a doomed firm its insiders supposedly maligned as “the pig” (hence Forde’s title), which Hands lost. Soon enough, a once-great British business was carved up and sold to its competitors, without many of the acts who had once underwritten its reputation.Those who had exited included Radiohead, Queen and the Rolling Stones, who were signed to the EMI subsidiary Virgin. According to industry rumours, plans for the latter group’s next move were explained to Mick Jagger at a meeting with Hands. They included “Stones Idol, a TV talent-search format … where Jagger and Keith Richards would be the judges, going all the way to a mooted Stones-themed hotel that included a pre-trashed room for the authentic rock’n’roll experience”. People beyond even the awfulness of the Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man, it seemed, were now in charge subsequent reports suggested that Jagger simply walked out, taking his band with him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a7b8105438fa4d251c7b6b67fdf52f8e0b0b29/0_569_4570_2741/master/4570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81a0268788f1a80b08603a9f1b83bfbb","title":"which way next how to cope with the psychological uncertainity of brexit","story":"As Brexit debates become ever more fractious, we are trapped in a cycle of anger, disbelief and impotence.

It is easy for both parties in this traumatic break to exclude or ridicule the legitimacy of the other’s position. The result of the referendum was a transfer of angry feelings from many leavers, those who had been economically and socially squeezed, to remainers. There was no escaping the leavers’ fury. We have all had to see the country as broken to give up the delusion that everyone was OK. Manifestly people weren’t. The question is how to absorb and reflect on the dispossession and rage. The Brexit vote said to remainers: “You will no longer have it your way. You are going to feel threatened as we have felt threatened. You can lose your hope as we lost ours.”Last week I gave a talk to people who had moved from countries across mainland Europe to live in the UK. They were German, Danish, Irish, Norwegian, Swedish and Ukrainian – all of them, by chance or choice, had settled here. There was an atmosphere of anger and confusion in the room. With their children in school, and having established their lives, they hadn’t expected to worry about their place in Britain: they belonged here. Now their idea of identity was under threat. The increase in episodes of racism since the referendum had caused many of them to think they had misunderstood their adopted country, one their children – supporters of Spurs, Liverpool, Crystal Palace and Manchester City – called home.These children also supported teams from their parents’ countries. Like me, and many from around Britain, they have multiple identities, and this is for the most part untroublesome. Yet what they said and felt was not so different from what many feel. Belonging was suddenly contingent. The limbo these Europeans feel themselves to be in is in some ways merely an exaggeration of the limbo that is affecting the entire population of Britain. For those who fear Brexit, the future looks uncertain and there is a sense of powerlessness. Others, who worry that the Brexit they voted for won’t be delivered, feel equally impotent.In June 2016, I wrote about the distress expressed to me and other therapists following the Brexit vote. This has only intensified over time. Alicia, who is 45 and works in the medical profession, tells me she feels collapsed Brexit talk is taking over her life. Her work had felt precariously balanced but now she fears she is unable to provide what she would want to for her patients or in her research. She is glued to the news, desperate to find a hint that what has happened will be undone. She wonders if she is insane to be in such a rage. Isaac, in his late 30s, has gone from being optimistic about Brexit to extreme pessimism. His job is under threat. He feels weakened and powerless. He wants to vote again. Sophie, a chemistry graduate student, who has lived in the UK since she was 13, has been asked to produce evidence that she has had private health insurance since she was a child in order to make a claim to become naturalised. She is poleaxed by the request and berates herself, despite the fact that organising this insurance would never have been her job.Therapists talk of traumatic reaction, when we feel shock and continually retell a story. This is what I am seeing and hearing, inside and outside the consulting room. People infused with fury are desperate to unload what they have just learned about the machinations or projected impact of Brexit. We want it to go away and yet we are obsessed by it. Details have to be repeated. Did you know? Did you hear? There is a common psychological process of rejecting what feels indigestible. With each reiteration of the facts there is the hope that one can come to terms with them at the same time as an inability to do so.Freud tells us in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920) that trauma occurs when overwhelming events destabilise our emotional balance. For most of us, trauma describes an experience that takes place in our private lives: unexpectedly losing a loved one, or being in a situation in which our sense of survival is on the line, such as fleeing a country, or sexual intrusion, or being booted out of a relationship without warning. Unless we have lived in war zones or under dictatorships, we don’t tend to think of daily political life as so damaging. Yet reactions to Brexit suggest that it is being experienced by many as a trauma, with intrusive and repetitive thoughts emerging from a severely disruptive or damaging situation. Disbelief, fear and the wish for it all to be a bad dream are common features of trauma.We separate off what we can’t bear to know, whether it is our personal part in the process, or the fact of having to recognise that those we thought were with us were not. We get lulled into thinking it will all be OK, only to be reawakened when we realise the bad thing has happened. We experience the shock all over again. We can’t escape it. Talking with friends and colleagues in Donald Trump’s America, there is a similar repetitive theme of outrage, disbelief and indigestibility.For us in the UK it feels as if no one was minding the shop. The political parents have abdicated. Attachment theory, which originated in the work of John Bowlby, has shown the importance of secure parental foundations and presence in forming stable ongoing identities. Insecure, anxious and avoidant attachments can lead to isolation or cleaving to relationships that mimic the insecurities experienced in early life. With the country’s identity ruptured, people of all political persuasions find solace in forms of solidarity that amplify a sense of being beleaguered while simultaneously proffering hope. The Brexit fracture and the belligerence associated with it has marked our society in disturbing ways. Public space is as inflamed as private space is in a orce. There are lies. Many lies. Lying is not just a moral category, it has psychological import. It ides us from aspects of ourselves. To maintain a lie, we have to scaffold it, to separate it off from doubt and questions. Then we become defensive and more insistent, as though by being more forceful, the deceit will hold us within it. What is on the other side of the lie becomes unreachable. Complexity and understanding are suppressed.We are all capable of this fundamentalist form of thought when we are cornered. We are all capable of finding outrage in the position of the other as a way of strengthening our position. We can seek solace in a fixed position as a bulwark against the difficulty of not knowing. The polarisation that Brexit has shown is inescapable. The democratic deficit many cushioned themselves against knowing is in our face. It is very real.As the withdrawal negotiations continue with no sign yet of resolution, the sense of uncertainty continues. The anxiety it provokes can lead us to want to give up on what we believe, to throw in the towel and agree to things not in our best interest. This can be true wherever we sit on the Brexit ide. The pressure for closure is intense. The desire to remake our country, to paper over the isions, to reset, is understandable but it does not get us anywhere. Without conversations that address the mutual disturbance, the hope for national reconciliation is slender.The brutality of the current political discourse is disturbing. The new Brexit slogan, “Tell them again”, points to menace, not reconciliation or a coming together of differences in productive ways. We are going to take a long time to process the hurt, the shock, the disappointment of societal fracture. We will need to develop ways of talking and listening to get us out of our silos, to protect us from fixed patterns of thought as we try to remake our country anew. This is a big task. We know how difficult it is even for orced families to reconstitute themselves so that their members all thrive. A nation rife with inequalities is a formidable proposition. Does psychotherapy have anything to offer here?From Freud to Wilfred Bion to modern practice, psychotherapy has learned much about staying with uncertainty and difficulty, and the ways that this can be productive. It’s the bread and butter of psychoanalysis. We often want to act impulsively. To do so is a relief. It expels the difficulty by changing the circumstances that are causing distress. Psychoanalysis disrupts this process by showing how difficult thoughts and feelings can be considered from different perspectives that then enrich the real possibilities for transformation. The process of talking over time allows one to think and feel in such a way that uncertainty itself can be tolerated. It isn’t comfortable but is itself a counterblast against closing oneself off.Therapy of all persuasions isn’t about what you do know but about what you can’t quite let yourself know. If we were transparent to ourselves, we wouldn’t need it. Therapy can also be a group process, in which people with different and sometimes dramatically opposed points of view learn to talk together and listen. They make common cause to support each other despite enormous differences which may start off as contempt or dismissal or just plain dislike. What never fails to impress is the emotional distance people can travel – from rigidity and fear to interest and acceptance of one another.There is now a move to promote regional and national conversations that might start to mend the emotional fallout of the UK’s Brexit trauma. These wouldn’t bridge the serious economic and social ides. That’s an altogether more fundamental project. But we have examples of processes such as the women’s initiatives in Belfast across the Falls Road during the Troubles and the team of analysts from Argentina who trained people on the ground during the civil war in Nicaragua. There have also been countless faith-instituted projects bringing people together from Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh groups to strengthen their communities.A commitment to this kind of process should be part of whatever change we make as a nation. Crashing out of the EU undermines our chances of addressing the trauma that Brexit has caused for many a deal would provide a boundary of safety, enabling the complex conversations that need to occur. History tells us what happens when economies in decline, with mounting social and economic anxiety, are captured by oversimple populist slogans which cast out those who don’t agree or are deemed not to look or sound right. We need to ensure this doesn’t happen, and instead reknit the social fabric in ways that are equitable and just.

However, customers who bought the meal said they found chicken nuggets in their wrap instead.The wrap was launched in January along with McDonald’s new vegetarian Happy Meal.People from across the country expressed their unhappiness on Twitter.Seb from Lincoln said: “Not going to lie but finding chicken in my veggie wrap was quite surprising … But definitely not loving it.”Sharing photos of the wrap filled with chicken, Emma Longley from Yorkshire tweeted: “I just ordered the veggie wrap from your store in Byker, turns out you gave me chicken … This is disgraceful I’m fuming was so looking forward to this … I’m a strict vegetarian and just took a mouthful of chicken, thanks a lot.”Another woman, from Glasgow in Scotland, said: “Been vegan for over two years and treated myself to a veggie wrap from McDonalds for lunch. Bit into it and it’s chicken … Inside a veggie packaging … I seriously hope you do something about this, I am extremely upset.”A spokesperson for McDonalds said: “We absolutely recognise that it is not acceptable to serve meat when our vegetarian product has been ordered, and we would like to apologise to any customer who has experienced this.“We would also like to reassure that we have a number of procedures in place to avoid inaccurate orders, and that, after we saw that mistakes were being made, we introduced a number of additional measures in our kitchens and communicated with all stores to reduce inaccuracies quickly and effectively.

But though independent shops, cafes and arts venues are here in abundance, there is one vital lifeline missing – a bank.Last week, the market town’s last surviving bank, a branch of Lloyds, closed its doors for the final time. Now there are no banks within a 15-mile stretch between Todmorden and Brighouse in West Yorkshire’s Calder Valley.For residents like Gareth Parry, who works as a counsellor in the area, the departure is nonsensical. “It’s a fabulously wealthy area. People come here to spend money, but there’s no bank,” he says.The 46-year-old, who also runs a cleaning business and does shifts at a cafe, is often paid in cash. Now he faces bussing the six miles to the nearest bank in Halifax to deposit his earnings.“I left my old bank because they closed down, and went to Lloyds because they promised they weren’t going to shut,” says Parry. “I find it quite hurtful and dismissive of them to close. I’m pretty miffed.”Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that nearly 6,000 local bank branches across the UK have shut since 2010 – a third of the total. In Hebden Bridge, two other banks – Natwest and Barclays – closed in 2016 and 2018 respectively.According to Lloyds, whose mobile bank will now visit the town twice a week, customers switching to online services or alternative branches have driven the latest closure.A spokesperson said: “Our new mobile branch service is already on the road, following our difficult decision to close the Hebden Bridge branch due to the changing ways customers choose to bank with us, which resulted in the branch being used less often.”Hannah Menzies is one of the young people in the town who can’t remember the last time they stepped into a bank. The 22-year-old sales assistant at health food shop Pennine Provisions says: “You can do almost everything online. It used to take a working day for cash to go into your account, but now it’s instant.”For small business owners, however, physical banks were a lifeline. Daily takings now have to be transported out of town, paid in at the post office, or picked up by a cash handling company. John Povey, 55, who runs DIY shop Bonsalls, says: “I asked the staff in Lloyds before they closed if we could pre-order change for the till from the mobile branch, but they said we can’t do that.”Povey adds that while more shoppers in Hebden are going cash-free, particularly since surcharges for using credit or debit cards were banned, he refuses to accept card payments for under £5 because of the transaction fee imposed by banks.There’s also the issue of the town’s dwindling number of cash machines – one of which was outside the Lloyds branch and was closed along with the bank. According to Beryl Chapman, 74, who thinks it is “disgusting” that there are no longer any banks open within walking distance, ATMs here often run out of cash or are broken into.For those without the time to travel out of town, Hebden’s small post office offers services for current account holders, such as cash withdrawals and paying in cheques. But while the extra footfall is good for business, postmaster Satnam Singh says the rates they are paid by banks to offer these services are pitiful.“Predominantly, my workers are doing work for the banks, but in a day they wouldn’t make enough from that for an hourly wage,” says Singh, who is self-employed as a franchisee. “I’m doing it as a community service, but I want banks to pay more for the future of our business.”But not everyone is as ready to succumb to adapting to life without a bank. David Fletcher, owner of Hebden Mill, which houses a gift shop and Cafe Innovation, has hopes of opening a community bank in the town.In September, the 85-year-old wrote to Norman Blackwell, a life peer and chairman of Lloyds Banking Group, asking whether they would transfer the bank property to locals.“I like to be cheeky. If you don’t ask you don’t get,” he says. While a response from the bank’s asset manager said little of the possibility of this happening, he did ask to set up a meeting with Fletcher.“They can choose to leave under a cloud as the last bank in town, or they could leave us as benefactors,” says Fletcher.He is vague about how the idea would work, or whether the bank could be used for withdrawals and deposits like a commercial bank. Right now, it’s “just a gleam in the eye”, he says, but among those offering support for his plan are other “prominent businessmen” in the town and Barry Collins, Calderdale council’s cabinet member for regeneration and economic strategy.Collins said: “For people who haven’t got the digital skills or businesses and workers who are dealing with a lot of cash, it’s important for the community that we try to find an alternative. The council want to try and assist with any alternative ideas suggesting cooperative, mutual models.”Some, such as Parry, are dubious about the idea: “Can it really guarantee security in the way a bank is legally obliged to?”But it wouldn’t be the first time there has been a successful community-led response to what businesses and governments fail to do in Hebden Bridge. Already, the town is home to a community-run town hall, a cinema and a cooperative that is building homes for affordable rent.As Fletcher point outs: “Hebden Bridge is not your ordinary town.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bd636ec883493c05677cffee4dc0bb583984c10/177_0_3278_1967/master/3278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4117f3057b8af46b10fb101e4b0a48c4","title":"rees mogg brexit emergency","story":"The plastic aristocrat’s bid to shut down parliament is outshone only by thermonuclear idiocy from Mark FrancoisAlthough he failed to emerge from an Airbus waving it, MP Mark Francois had in his hand a piece of paper. “My father, Reginald Francois, was a D-day veteran,” he thundered to the news cameras on Friday, shortly before ripping up the aforementioned document. “He never submitted to bullying by any German. Neither will his son.”Leaving aside the somewhat bathetic description of Rommel’s Atlantic Wall defences as “bullying”, can you guess what Mark’s piece of paper actually was? Certification of a history doctorate? (He amusingly already holds an MA in war studies.) A letter from his future self reading simply “Don’t be a thermonuclear dick, Mark – it ends badly”?I’m afraid not. The document was in fact a widely reported missive from the German CEO of Airbus, Tom Enders, who employs 14,000 people in this country and supports a further 110,000 jobs in the supply chain. This week he expressed intense frustration that “more than two years after the result of the 2016 referendum, businesses are still unable to plan for the future … If you are still really sure that Brexit is best for Britain,” Enders concluded, “come together and deliver a pragmatic withdrawal agreement.” Or, as Francois counter-reasoned: “Tom Enders was a German paratrooper in his youth.”Incredibly, given this competition, Quote of the Week must still go to Nadine Dorries, who went on telly to express contempt for Brexit-cautious MPs “who really don’t care about their careers going up in flames”. Did the erstwhile gobbler of kangaroo testicles just say that out loud? To hear Nadine speak at the best of times feels like intruding on private stupidity, but even by her standards, this is eye-catching from the member for Mid-Bedfordshire. It can’t really be that Nadine should have been in parliament for almost 14 years without anyone informing her that politicians are in fact SUPPOSED to act out of a higher sense of duty than personal career advancement.Far more believable is the idea that someone has actually flipped her wiring, so that the things Nadine ought to say remain only secret thoughts, while her inner monologue is now broadcast in all its epoch-illuminating glory. Hilarity ensues. Or possibly catastrophe. Ask me again in 63 days.Indeed, as the Brexit clock ticks down, Nadine may well be regarded by future historians as the archetypal thinker of the era. Even at this incredibly late hour, vast swaths of parliament are doggedly placing self-interest above national interest, apparently bolstered by some vague belief that Britain is too big to fail. Or, as Holly Golightly liked to think of Tiffany’s, that nothing very bad could ever happen to you there. If they hold fast to their current priorities and shun the personal inconvenience of compromise, no deal could very conceivably be stumbled into.Of course, there would be no stumbling about it for some. Consider the lavishly preposterous MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham, Daniel Kawczynski, who this week took it upon himself to announce that he has written to the Polish prime minister and requested “formally” that Poland veto any request by the UK to extend article 50. We can’t be sure what formal channels this MP believes himself to be operating within, but openly demanding that foreign powers subvert the will of the UK legislature did seem to be the second hottest take on parliamentary sovereignty in as many days.The hottest take, as so often, belonged to Daniel’s European Research Group (ERG) colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg, who on Wednesday gave an address during which he suggested that the Queen should, if necessary, suspend parliament to stop things not going his way. Great to see that prorogation has officially entered the game, as yet another reminder that Brexit is rarely about the things it says it is about. Nothing says “I believe passionately in parliamentary sovereignty” quite as convincingly as demanding that the sovereign shut down parliament.Rees-Mogg believes Britain could surf the wave of no deal. He’s really very like Patrick Swayze in Point Break in that respect – except with an opera coat, no charisma and zero personal exposure to the 50-year storm. Yet people continue to misread him as dependably as his father used to misread the future. At Wednesday’s event, the economist Roger Bootle introduced him as “a modest man … too modest, almost, for his own good”. To which the only sane reply is: lololololololol. If you had to distil into one personage the British people’s gibbering historical deference to terrible ideas advanced by low-to-middlebrow post-feudal shitlords who openly detest them, this plastic aristocrat would be it. Rees-Mogg is the logical end of whole centuries of barking up the wrong tree. In the most recent leadership polls of Tory members, obviously, he trailed only Boris Johnson.And so to Brexit’s best-paid influencers. What an inevitability to learn that the former Brexit secretary David Davis has walked straight into a £60,000, 20-hour-a-year gig to advise the digger manufacturing firm JCB. That works out at £3,000 an hour, which feels like the sort of rate that might be expected if your workplace was a glass coffee table in Riyadh. Boris Johnson seems to be on ten grand a pop from the same source, suggesting he provides services too grotesque even for metaphorical allusion. It certainly feels more fitting than ever that he made last week’s speech at JCB in front of a great big hoe.Perhaps the best that can be said for JCB’s Brexiteer chairman, Sir Anthony Bamford, is that his business is, at least for now, still headquartered in the UK. News that the leave advocate James Dyson is to relocate his HQ to Singapore is proving harder to spin, particularly given he’s said: “It’s to make us future-proof for where we see the biggest opportunities.” Still, it will be one upside if we’re no longer required to genuflect and defer to Dyson on matters other than suction. I wonder if it says something about Britain that its Greatest Inventor makes vacuum cleaners and hair dryers and so on. Nothing wrong with that, of course – we all need them. But it’s hardly the premier league of inventions. Oh, you can give it “the airblade” all you like. But faced with an attacking move by the creators of artificial hearts or water-powered engines, Dyson and his hand-dryers would be hopelessly outclassed.Mark Francois may believe Britain could never be outclassed, even as he talks in a way that might reasonably be expected to appal the actual participants in events over which he has only heavy-breathed. But others on both the leave and remain sides may judge the UK’s self-respect to be hanging by a thread.And that’s where we stand as Theresa May heads into the latest of her crunch weeks – although Philip Hammond has reinforced the government’s reputation for can-kicking by suggesting that Tuesday’s vote doesn’t have to be “the sort of high-noon moment … It’s a great British tradition to compromise and find a solution,” he judged on Friday, “rather than standing throwing rocks at each other from different sides of the argument.” Mmm. Is Hammond watching the same Brexit you’re watching? The UK’s mad yen for self-dramatisation is a big part of what got us here perhaps the sense of ourselves as instinctively great at this stuff should be abandoned as the need for a solution moves into its emergency stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22e2800ce0f20a5c06b9d898a53090ca8be7f794/0_173_5008_3006/master/5008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71fffa1809b7b98833036ad12d1183c3","title":"my life without sugar","story":"My plan was to have a sugar-free month – but now I feel so much better that I can’t imagine going backThree years ago, I stopped eating sugar. My plan was to have a sugar-free month, just to see if it made a difference. I had done similar experiments before – a month without caffeine, or alcohol, or reading news online. Aside from chocolate, I wasn’t a big eater of sugar, I thought, so I didn’t expect to notice any change. But I did.Giving up sugar set me free. And so, what began as an experiment has become my new life. I have changed in ways that I had not thought possible.I used to get “hangry” – that grumpy, urgent craving that demands prompt attention. To stave it off, I carried bags of almonds or dried fruit. Back when I ate sugar, I couldn’t go running in the morning – if I tried, I would get dizzy, and anyway, my legs felt as if they were made of stone. I would have slumps in the afternoon – my head would get foggy – so if I was working from home, I would take a nap. I had mood swings, joy alternating with despair. I had assumed that all of these things were simply part of life, of how I was, a frustrating aspect of my makeup. And now all of them are gone.For the first two weeks of my unsweetened life, though, I was in a foul temper. At first, I attributed this to the darkness and gloom of the winter days. But as I started to feel better – calmer, happier, more even-keeled –\u0026nbspa more sinister thought began to nag at me. Had I been in withdrawal?My decision to stop sugar was taken on a whim. Back then, aside from its role in tooth decay, I knew little about its possible effects on health. But when I discovered how much better I felt without it, I became curious – and began to read.To a chemist, sugar refers to a class of molecules made of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen some of these serve particular biological roles. Lactose, for example, is found in milk deoxyribose gives the “D” to DNA. But in daily life, the main sugars one meets are glucose, fructose and sucrose – which is a marriage of the other two. That is, each molecule of sucrose is one glucose linked to one fructose. Interestingly, the two simple sugars have the same chemical formula – 6 atoms of carbon, 12 of hydrogen, 6 of oxygen – but different chemical structures. The human tongue detects this: fructose tastes sweeter.Glucose is synonymous with blood sugar, since it is transported in the blood and delivered to cells to fuel their energetic needs. But you can also find it, along with fructose, in fruits and vegetables. Sucrose is extracted from sugar cane or beets, and is usually encountered as the white crystals of table sugar. When most people speak of “sugar”, they mean sucrose. High-fructose corn syrup, the most common sweetener of non-diet soft-drinks, is a mixture of glucose and fructose. So is honey– though honey is a complex concoction that contains many other compounds.The history of sugar is full of darkness. The European appetite for sweetness drove the slave trade according to one estimate, in the Americas, two-thirds of enslaved Africans worked on sugar cane plantations. Sugar is also implicated in lung cancer. How? Because the tobacco in blended cigarettes has typically been soaked in sugar syrups this makes the smoke easier to take into the lungs.The grim harvest does not stop there. A growing number of doctors blame sugar consumption for a long list of medical woes. These include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, heart disease, gout, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, many cancers, and perhaps even Alzheimer’s. Some researchers have even linked the eating of sugar in childhood to the development of myopia, arguing that the spikes in insulin secretion caused by sugar consumption interfere with the normal development of the eyes. In short: the recent medical literature about sugar makes alarming reading.Such connections are, of course, disputed. But as an evolutionary biologist, as well as someone who has felt the immediate benefits of a sugar-free lifestyle, I find the claims persuasive. For most of human history, after all, milk, honey and fruits have been the main sources of sweetness. When cane sugar first made its way to Europe around 1,000 years ago, it was treated as a spice, a medicine and a preservative.In 1700, the average sugar consumption in the United Kingdom was around two kilograms per person per year. Today, the figure is 10 times that amount. Over the past 300 years, sugars have thus gone from an occasional luxury to a substantial component of the average western diet. The present sugar glut is an anomaly in human experience. We have changed the world to suit our appetites but our bodies cannot accommodate the change.Different foods have different effects on the body. To see this, look no further than sugars. Intake of glucose directly stimulates the production of the hormone insulin that of fructose does not. Fructose, instead, is metabolised in the liver, where it is turned into fat. Indeed, evidence is mounting that fructose is a major player in metabolic illness. When you consume table sugar, you get both fructose and glucose, because the sucrose is chopped into its component parts. Repeatedly consuming vast quantities of these substances – as when you eat lots of sugary food or drink lots of sodas – could thus cause a double whammy of metabolic disturbance.In my new life, I don’t eat foods with added sugar. Some of these are obvious: cakes, cookies, ice creams, doughnuts, muffins, candies. Some are less so. Vinegar, weirdly, often has added sugar. So do pickles. I no longer eat sushi – the rice has usually been sweetened. I steer clear of maple syrup. I also avoid super-sweet fruits – grapes, persimmons, dates. Fruit juice? No thanks.In abandoning sugar, I’ve become aware how ubiquitous it is. Want to eat something on the go? Almost everything for sale contains sugar. Even recipes for vegetables often call for adding it. In fact, until three years ago, I was guilty of such practices myself, often adding a spoonful of sugar to the cooking water of green beans, peas, and sweetcorn (sweetcorn!), a practice I now look back on with astonishment.The social pressure to eat sugar is enormous whole meals are geared around the stuff. In many countries, breakfast is an orgy of sugar cake at tea time was a fixture of my childhood. I still attend meetings where someone is always designated to bring sweet food for everyone. Halloween has become a festival of candy. Then there’s the sugar propaganda. It’s everywhere. Clothes for little girls covered with pictures of lollipops. Giant knitted ice cream cones as cuddly toys. Soaps formed to resemble cup cakes. Candlesticks in the form of ceramic doughnuts, complete with icing. Cut-out books of paper desserts.I’m not so militant in my avoidance that I interrogate restaurant chefs about which vinegar they use, or whether they add sugar to the cooking water. On special occasions – an anniversary, perhaps, or a birthday – I will eat a mouthful of, say, lemon meringue pie. But only as a rare treat, perhaps five or six times a year. Always in the past, after one of my experiments, I would take up the old habits. But not with sugar. It’s not just the long shadow of possible illness. It’s that – like others I know who have stopped – I feel so much better without it. I like knowing that, if I need to, I can hike all day without eating. I enjoy being free of rampaging hunger. Running in the mornings has become a delight. I prefer feeling more serene, less prone to mood swings or afternoon fatigue. My mind feels clearer. I can’t imagine going back. Life is more savory this way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5de4a6c3bb581923bd35014fbffc4e7d274f8128/0_224_8160_4896/master/8160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb2465b75878ff389114bb0e445e1ed","title":"teachers job share workloads recruitment retention strategy damian hinds","story":"Workloads will be cut under recruitment and retention strategy, says Damian HindsTeachers will be given more help to job share and a lighter workload in an attempt to prevent experienced staff from leaving the profession, the education secretary has said.Speaking to the  before the launch of a new teacher recruitment and retention strategy next week, Damian Hinds argued that outdated attitudes among school leaders, especially men, may be holding back the adoption of practices such as flexible working.The national strategy, which Hinds said is the first of its kind for schools in England, aims to reshape the profession by lessening traditional burdens on teachers such as marking and lesson planning, as well as more recent encumbrances including email overload and data entry.Hinds’ proposals include what he calls a “job share Match” to help teachers who want to work part-time find someone to fill the gap.“Part of my job is making sure that everybody else knows how hard teachers work,” Hinds said, adding that he wanted to encourage parents “not to never email a school or a teacher, because that can be important, but to exercise some restraint, knowing that there many other things that teachers have to do”.He said there would be a focus on reducing “the sheer volume of data being collected in schools”, and teachers would be offered help in designing lesson plans. Model programmes for geography, history and science in key stage 2 and 3 will be the first to be rolled out.The secondary school population is increasing rapidly, with further growth expected in the next few years and concern mounting that England’s schools will not have enough teachers. There are particular worries about subjects such as modern foreign languages, maths and science.Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, one of the union leaders consulted by Hinds about the strategy, said: “The government is facing a huge crisis in teacher recruitment and retention. They’ve started listening on some things, and we’re pleased about that, but there is a whole lot more to do.”Hinds said a big part of the strategy is encouraging job shares to retain teachers who might otherwise leave, and to do so, he wants to tackle the cultural and structural issues that have held back schools from using job shares.“What we are keen to do is to find a way for people who don’t have a background together to find a partner to apply for a job with, hence the Match terminology,” he said.In a recent speech, Hinds said he was promoting the use of jobsharing to an audience of school leaders, only to be met with laughter from some, who told him complex lesson timetabling made job sharing unlikely.“At the end of the session, the woman who guided me out of the room said: ‘Have you ever noticed how they were all men on that table who were laughing? It’s always men women leaders in schools find a way to make the timetabling work,’” he said.“Obviously I can’t vouch for that in a Office for National Statistics-quality observation, but there might be something in it.Other parts of the strategy will streamline the teacher recruitment process, but a key plank for retention is to tackle the workload burden that has been a consistent complaint among teachers.Hinds said the strategy has been developed in consultation with teaching unions and praised their involvement, in a departure from the position of some of his predecessors.“The headteachers, and the unions, our agendas are the same. We have a shared interest, clearly, in making sure that teaching is an attractive profession to be in,” he said.“Teachers are my No 1 priority. And within that, I have said repeatedly that I recognise that because teachers say to us the whole time that their No 1 issue is workload.”The burden of marking should be reduced by recent changes to Ofsted inspections, which minimise marking and data collection.Hinds’ collaborative approach to dealing with teaching unions appears to extend to colleagues from other political parties, when it comes to Brexit. As the government confronts the deadlock at Westminster, he said MPs will eventually be prepared to compromise.MPs will vote on Tuesday on a series of backbench amendments aimed at testing the support in parliament for competing Brexit plans.The education secretary has, alongside Amber Rudd, advocated a process of “indicative votes” for some time, though in his case this is because he believes Theresa May’s deal is more popular than any of the alternatives.“My own analysis, when you go through the different permutations and starting points, and how different people might move closer to other positions, I have to say you get pretty close to the prime minister’s negotiated deal,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/423a2e1fe416a5fa3b1328d21b6233c29c025396/0_22_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1b2983f2d73f1d8326357ba15bf3556","title":"real junk food project turns supermarket waste into tasty meals","story":"London cafes bring people together while tackling the UK’s food waste problemMothers with toddlers at their ankles sit beside elderly men and women out for a welcome bit of company on a Monday lunchtime. Plates are piled with steaming pasta, couscous salad and warm bread rolls as the chefs wipe sweat from their foreheads in a galley kitchen next door.This is a bustling local restaurant in an affluent area of south-west London, but there is one big difference from the many fashionable cafes that line the streets of this London “village”. The food has all been saved from the bin.On Thursday Tesco announced it would be working with the charity FareShare to try to reduce food waste, but across the country a growing environmental movement has been taking matters into their own hands for months to collect and use waste food.Collected earlier that morning from a number of supermarkets which have been persuaded to hand over their waste food rather than dump it into the dustbin, the ingredients for the latest Real Junk Food Cafe in Twickenham are used to create wholesome lunchtime meals at a pop-up restaurant.The Real Junk Food Project (RJFP), aims to save as much food from the bins as possible by encouraging supermarkets to hand it to the cafes instead. Where supermarkets might have been slow to act the RJFP has gone door to door to collect waste from stores to force the issue.“This is not a cafe for the homeless, or a cafe for the elderly, it is not a food bank. The cafe starts from an environmental stance, to stop all this food going into landfill, and the social element of people coming together to eat and chat comes out of that,” said Chrissy Weller, who set up the cafe with her friend Clare Box. “We welcome anyone here to pay as much as they feel for the food, or nothing at all. So you get a big mix of people sitting around a table talking and eating together.”The cafe in Twickenham is one of the latest to be set up under the RJFP banner in an attempt to tackle the mountain of food waste in the UK, where 1.9 million tonnes of food are thrown away each year.Set up in 2013 by the former chef Adam Smith, there are now 127 cafes preparing and serving waste food in seven countries and 10 “social supermarkets” that collect, store and distribute waste food on a much larger scale than the cafes are able to. Each new venture has to go through a due diligence check by the RJFP before being given a licence to operate.The movement spreads through a combination of inspiration, shared experience and determined volunteers in each local area where they operate. Weller and Box drew inspiration from the well developed network in Brighton, a city that hosts RJFP cafes four days a week and has opened a social supermarket known as The Hub in premises provided by the council.The Brighton cafes have been recognised for the quality of food they put on the menu. They won two golds and a silver in the Brighton and Hove food and drink awards this year.“We work in a professional manner, we are food people who make sure everything is the best it can be,” said Sarah Griffen, from Brighton RJFP.“Over four cafes we are feeding about 300 people a week, all our food was on its way to the bin. We are coming first and foremost from an environmental project and the social and community benefits come from that.”With the help of the environmental charity, Weller and Banks were given a venue – gold dust in an area of exorbitant rents – a room in a local community centre, the Etna, which includes a small kitchen.“We had a quiet opening because we had no idea where the food would come from or how much would come, but someone from the project told us ‘set it up and the food will come’. We started on 4 June with hot toasties from Harris and Hoole cooked on an old George Forman griddle and a donated vat of coffee,” said Clare. “Since we started we have saved 1.39 tonnes of food. We weigh everything that comes through the door.”The menu now boasts much more sophisticated offerings, including homemade apple tarte tatin, banana bread and soups.For chefs Chrissy and Clare, who have a rota of volunteer cooks, it is a little like being in a MasterChef competition. They get a text on Sunday night alerting them to what food is available at the local supermarkets and bakeries involved, and early on Monday morning they drive to several venues to collect it. “We have no idea what food we will be given on the day. Both of us are good at putting things together out of nothing.”The Twickenham cafe has inspired other similar projects. Mark Griffiths, who works with disadvantaged families and children ineight schools in the surrounding area, leapt on the idea to help the many local families struggling to feed their children. Each week at Victoria junior school in Feltham, Griffiths and his colleague Denise Haines from the School and Family Works group set up a stall in the playground which is covered with food rescued from local supermarkets and the local Cavan Bakery.“The parents who are in my family groups talk about how desperate they are and how they are struggling,” said Griffiths. “One single mother of three children has just £30 a week to buy food for herself and her children. She is really thin. I saw Chrissy and Clare’s cafe and thought we could do something similar in schools.“The ‘save the planet’ focus means there is no stigma. We hand out leaflets which say you would be doing the world a favour if you took this food. It goes within minutes.”For Smith, the cafes are just the beginning. He recently opened the 10th RJFP social supermarket in a warehouse in Wakefield, and cafes and social supermarkets are springing up in Germany, France, Japan and the US. “We can feed thousands of people from a warehouse,” he said. “We support food banks, and charities and schools and provide food boxes for 18,000 children a week from the Wakefield one, all of which has a much bigger impact.”He is driven and focused, and angry about the scale of food waste in the world. “Our food system is out of control. It is too big and too complex, the supermarkets don’t care unless their bottom line is affected. They are some of the biggest waste producers in the country. It needs to be stripped back and started over again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1c0226ddba3c5124c3d3d067d1a357ddd714463/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17cbbdbf9b0c3572cb01d8094ed064b5 700w","title":"the best products for fabulous feet beauty","story":"I enjoy the foot challenge – thorough and robust exfoliation yields satisfying resultsPeople often tell me they are repulsed by feet. They’re gross and repellent, apparently. And while I can see where they’re coming from – especially in winter, when dryness becomes extreme, heels crack and nails become neglected and gnarly under the cover of thick socks and tights – I must admit I enjoy the challenge. I’m not ashamed to say that just as I’ll gleefully squeeze anyone’s blackheads and extract their spots, I take pleasure in making over their (freshly washed) feet. Thorough and robust exfoliation yields satisfying results. Foot scrubs – creams containing scratchy bits – are perfectly fine and pleasant, but they’ll have zero effect on hard, calloused skin. By far the better remedy is the oldest: a foot file (not the inferior, but more expensive, mechanical or sonic kind) and elbow grease, used dry and briskly across the heels, outer toes and balls of the feet, works wonders.

Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

Is its creator a genius or a monster?I first heard about Dau five years ago, and have been figuratively banging on the door ever since, to no avail. Two weeks ago, the door opened – literally. I am invited to a mansion block on London’s Piccadilly where, behind an anonymous black door, lies another world. The lobby is dimly, atmospherically lit – a room out of a David Lynch movie. A man in a 1940s-style suit and hat stands pulling back the curtain and peeking on to the street – except he turns out to be a mannequin. A bald security guard with a Russian accent takes my signature and photograph. Photography and recording are forbidden. A friendly American woman guides me through labyrinthine corridors painted black and red and grey, the walls plastered with Soviet-era posters and photos. There are more mannequins in vintage costumes in startling places: hanging from a chandelier, kneeling and kissing a Soviet flag. There is a large mannequin workshop. There are modern editing suites behind frosted glass walls. There is a restaurant serving Georgian cuisine, and a function room in 1940s-style decor. The sound of a dog barking carries down the corridor. “That’s a real dog, by the way,” my guide says. You can’t be too sure.I am here to watch some films. Dau is a film project, or at least, it began as one. Now, nobody knows how to describe it. It has been called a “Stalinist Truman Show”, a serious anthropological experiment, even a “Soviet Love Island”. In scale, it has been compared to infamous movie shoots that spiralled out of control, such as Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now. But Dau also has echoes of the Stanford prison experiment – in which students lost sight of the fact that they were playing a role, acting as guards and prisoners rather too enthusiastically. Stanford’s experiment had to be shut down after six days Dau’s continued for three years.Dau began in 2005 as a conventional biopic of a real-life Russian scientist named Lev Landau. Landau worked with pioneering quantum physicists such as Niels Bohr, had a hand in the Soviet atomic weapons programme, and won a Nobel prize in 1962. He took an experimental approach to sex and drugs as well as science, living by his belief that marriage should be no impediment to sexual freedom (his wife, Kora, was less enthusiastic). The film’s director was Ilya Khrzhanovsky, a then 29-year-old Russian with just one previous work to his name – a challenging, hallucinatory drama titled 4, which had won considerable acclaim. The Greek-born conductor Teodor Currentzis was cast as the lead, simply named Dau. Non-actors made up the majority of the huge cast – 400 principal actors and 10,000 extras.The central location of Dau was a Soviet research institute, inspired by the secret facility in which Landau lived and worked from the late 30s until his death in 1968. About a year into shooting, in 2009, a gigantic set, the size of two football pitches, was constructed at an abandoned swimming baths in Kharkiv, north-east Ukraine. But when it was completed, Khrzhanovsky abandoned the idea of finishing the film to focus exclusively on his replica institute, now also known as Dau.It became less a film set than a parallel world: a functioning mini-state, stuck in the mid-20th century and sealed off from the modern world. Dau was populated with hundreds of extras, or “participants”, who lived as faithfully as possible as Soviet citizens. The period authenticity was obsessive, covering clothes (even down to the underwear), hairstyles, food packaging, cigarette brands. What is more, time moved forwards inside Dau, from 1938 to 1968, so all the period detail was continually updated. Participants were paid in Russian roubles, which could be spent on set. (Some of the older extras, playing caretakers, smuggled in their own roubles saved from the Soviet era and tried to spend them they were reprimanded for using “fake” money.)Dau’s cast of non-actors was drawn from a nationwide database of auditionees compiled by the producers. The number of videotaped auditions fluctuates between 210,000 and 392,000, depending on who you ask many of Dau’s “official” statistics are all but unverifiable. Roles were played by people who had played those roles for real: cleaners, waitresses, academics, party officials, shamans, artists even, sometimes, criminals and real-life neo-Nazis, the latter of whom brought the project to a close by helping to destroy the set in “1968”. Scientists who visited or took up temporary residency there included Nobel-prize-winning physicist David Gross, neuroscientist James Fallon, and Harvard maths professor Shing-Tung Yau. The artists included Marina Abramović, Carsten Höller and theatre director Peter Sellars.The weirdest thing was, hardly any of this was actually filmed. This was not a giant Big Brother house there were no hidden cameras. A single cinematographer – German veteran Jürgen Jürges – roamed the set with a three-person crew. Between 2009 and 2011, he filmed 700 hours of footage – only a fraction of the duration of the “experiment”. The rest of the time, people apparently went about their Soviet business, unobserved.The Scottish producer Eddie Dick got a taste of Dau in 2011, when he went to Ukraine to discuss a potential collaboration between Khrzhanovsky and director Nicolas Roeg. The induction process was meticulous, he tells me. He and his colleague were given a crib sheet of facts about 1953 – the current year inside Dau. They were dressed in period costume Dick’s hair was cut new spectacles with more period-appropriate frames were quickly ordered from a local optician. They were given “passports” and some (real) roubles. On the threshold of the set, their papers were checked by guards and they were interrogated about the purpose of their visit.“I wasn’t sure if everybody started doing things when we appeared, but certainly everybody was doing what they were supposed to be doing,” Dick says. Armed guards were marching up and down. People were eating in the cafe three or four scientists were conducting experiments in the laboratory with electromagnetic guns. The journalists were preparing the newspaper of the day. The architects were poring over a plan of a Kharkiv of the future – as in, the 1960s. He even visited Dau’s apartment and met his wife, Nora, played by the Russian actor Radmila Shchyogoleva. “A tiny babushka opened the door. Nora floated downstairs in an elegant dress and had tea with us for half an hour. She was in character the whole time. The illusion was kept up by everyone and everything,” Dick says. “We never broke the rules, either. I never turned to anyone and said, ‘Come on. What the fuck’s going on here?’ You found yourself mesmerised by the facade, and we just went along with it.” But throughout Dick’s visit, he saw no filming taking place.Some people allegedly moved to Ukraine and lived at Dau for months, even years, eating, working and sleeping on the set. Others came and went quickly, convinced that this recreation of a totalitarian state had morphed into something genuinely oppressive and dark. Rumours began to circulate that Khrzhanovsky was as interested in sex and power as he was in art. Rather than Coppola’s shoot of Apocalypse Now, Dau began to sound like the heart of darkness itself: an entire world cut off from civilisation, living by its own rules, with Khrzhanovsky as its Colonel Kurtz figure, a film-maker gone rogue.The reason Dau’s door opened to me is that, nearly 15 years after its inception, the project is finally ready to show to the public. Three immersive exhibitions are planned for this year, in Paris, London, then Berlin. Before the opening, I am promised an interview with Khrzhanovsky in Paris. First, though, I am required to watch at least four of the 13 feature films that have been edited from 700 hours of footage from the institute. (More is planned: a TV series, documentaries, and, at some point, a cinema release for the original Dau movie.)The first three films I am shown are a trilogy centring on Nora. The films are in Russian with no subtitles, but through an earpiece a monotone voice narrates the English translation. In the first, Nora’s mother comes to visit her at the institute – which looks less like a genuine Soviet facility than a postmodern fantasia based on one. In the second film, Dau (Currentzis) is visited by his former lover, a beautiful Greek woman named Maria. Nora is away, but then returns unexpectedly.The third film, set more than a decade later, is more startling. Dau has considerably aged and is almost bedridden (the real Lev Landau had a debilitating car accident in 1962 he died in 1968). His son Denis has grown up into an eccentric man-child. Nora is bored and lonely. There is incest, and prolonged scenes of graphic, unsimulated sex. In the fourth film, the institute’s caretakers get drunk on vodka. An old lady vomits copiously. Then, for the bulk of the film, two men, Sasha and Valera, embark on a night of drunken passion that swings between tenderness, clumsy sex and physical and verbal abuse.The films are both exhilarating and boring. There are long, rambling dialogue scenes with very few cuts (Jürges shoots with a single camera). But there is an authentic emotional rawness and intensity to the drama. The experience is closer to watching a documentary, or perhaps a Danish Dogme film, like Lars von Trier’s The Idiots.The true scale of the project becomes apparent when I am shown a 10-minute trailer for the original, still unfinished Dau movie, which looks appetisingly epic: vast crowds, 1930s street scenes, a huge replica Soviet propeller plane. There are countless striking images: a masked ball, a church bell crashing to the ground, piles of rotten cabbages, women smashing up clay rabbits on a production line.I am also shown the digital component of the project. In Paris, visitors will be able to explore hours of footage from within custom-built booths, like confession boxes. My screen is ided into a grid of 16 sub-screens, each playing a random scene, like a bank of surveillance cameras. Click on one and it becomes full-screen. Supplementary information is available on each character in any scene: biographies, photo galleries, documentation such as passports and letters.Scanning this brings up a bewildering panoply of images: Abramović (in 50s costume) undergoing a purification ritual by a shaman Fallon discussing capitalism at a dinner party Dau standing over a naked man and woman having sex (there is always at least one screen playing sexual content). An official abusing a tearful, naked woman in a prison cell shockingly, he forces her to drink cognac, then to put the bottle in her vagina. Nothing looks simulated.I recognise people from the movies I have seen: a bearded scientist who insulted Dau’s son as “clinically retarded” is now discussing a recent ayahuasca experiment. Elsewhere, one of the waitresses from the institute’s cafe is standing on a table with two men in their underpants at a party. They all begin throwing knives at an abstract painting. “That’s what I call contemporary art!” one of them exclaims. “Now we can put this up in a gallery.”Others are more sceptical. “I’m convinced the reason the project has been active for so long has nothing to do with creative reasons, but that it allows Khrzhanovsky to live a luxurious and tyrannical lifestyle, lording it over dozens, if not hundreds, of people on a Russian oligarch’s dime,” says one critic, who asked not to be named.The “oligarch” is no secret: he is a Russian entrepreneur named Sergei Adoniev, who became a Bulgarian citizen in 2008. One estimate puts his wealth at $800m, mostly made in the Russian telecommunications business. He also funds Russia’s opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, and largely devotes his time and wealth to cultural and philanthropic causes. But this week Bulgaria rescinded Adoniev’s citizenship a ministry of justice spokeswoman said this followed notification that he “had been convicted in the United States 20 years ago on fraud charges”.When I visit Paris ahead of the launch, I meet Martine d’Anglejan-Chatillon, who Khrzhanovsky “cast” in the role of Dau’s executive producer” in 2016. Dau is “the antithesis of culture as entertainment,” she explains, “of having this nice, comfortable thing that you already know what it is before you go.” Visitors to Dau in Paris will not be able to fully control their own experience, she says. You do not buy a ticket you are granted a “visa”. You can choose your length of stay – six hours, 24 hours or unlimited – and you must fill out a psychometric questionnaire online, the responses to which generate your own bespoke itinerary. Assuming your application is successful, you are required to trade your mobile phone for a device that directs you to various sites across the two venues. It could be a 400-seat auditorium or a fourth-level basement. I tour back-of-house spaces decorated in Dau’s now-familiar SovietLynchian aesthetic: dimly lit corridors, Soviet paraphernalia, more mannequins. One room is a 1940s Russian parlour another is filled with the contents of a Berlin sex shop.Your device might send you to a film screening, then to a talk or a performance by a visiting artist such as Currentzis, Brian Eno, Massive Attack’s Robert del Naja, or theatre director Romeo Castellucci. You might be prescribed some viewing on the Dau digital platform. And finally, you will be directed to a one-to-one session in a booth with an “active listener”, who could be a real-life priest or a rabbi or a psychologist.Were there aspects of the project that made D’Anglejan-Chatillon uncomfortable, I ask. “Of course. One projects. In the ambiguities that Ilya creates, we project our fears, our anxieties, our egos. I think that’s part of the work: it activates whatever part of you is a little bit damaged or heightened.”She puts the question back to me. I mention the scene with the actor playing a prison guard abusing the naked woman. It is a scene from one of the 13 features, she explains, focusing on the woman, who is by no means disempowered throughout. And it is, after all, acting, she reminds me. “She knows she can stop. Everyone would stop if she said, ‘I can’t handle this.’ But she has chosen to put herself almost through this… almost this fire. Probably to find something else on the other side.” Without speaking to the woman herself, it is hard to verify this.The casting sheds some light on how Dau’s realism was achieved. Dau’s man-child son is played by Nikolay Voronov, who turns out to be a Ukrainian YouTube star. Sasha and Valera, the two gay lovers, were formerly homeless people, someone tells me, and, “They do that every night.” Nora’s mother is played by Radmila Shchyogoleva’s real-life mother, Lidiya.I speak to Dau’s star, Teodor Currentzis, over the phone. “The point is how to be yourself and not to be yourself at the same moment,” he says. He is now back at his day job, as artistic director of Russia’s Perm State Opera and Ballet Theatre. “You are in an environment that you know is a game, but it doesn’t work if you are not yourself,” he explains. Currentzis was invited by Khrzhanovsky to play the role of Dau after meeting him socially in Moscow, in 2005.He spent about a year shooting the film, then two years within the “institute”, on and off. He lived, slept and ate there, 24 hours a day, for days and weeks at a time. There was no nipping out to check emails. And when he and others did leave the institute, “sometimes we would notice after a while that we hadn’t changed our clothes. We were sleeping and waking up and working in the clothes we had worn inside. When we were out, it was like visiting another time. The real world was like a set to us.” According to Currentzis, many people lived at Dau for the duration of the experiment. “I know people who, if they had to decide whether to stay there or to return to ‘the future’, they would stay.”Within the institute, Currentzis had some freedom to do whatever he liked, but situations were also imposed on him. Somebody would knock at the door of his apartment, for example, or Nora’s mother would arrive. Sometimes he discussed events with Khrzhanovsky sometimes Khrzhanovsky would not speak to him at all.The experience was no holiday. “I had absolute freedom inside, but if the ‘KGB’ grabbed me, they could send me to jail. They could behave really badly to you. I felt very uncomfortable many times, but it’s the same discomfort I feel in my own life. If we want to make something that is real, it has to be like real life.”Other people I spoke to were less comfortable with Khrzhanovsky’s project. Many former Dau associates were reluctant to speak to me at all. Eddie Dick found Khrzhanovsky to be worryingly megalomaniacal and surprisingly limited in his film knowledge he had not heard of Nicolas Roeg or seen any of his work. “His overweening arrogance was breathtaking at times. All his staff were treated like servants and everybody treated him like a prince. If he said it was raining outside, it was definitely raining.” Dick helped Khrzhanovsky obtain a work permit for the UK, but when they met again in Edinburgh, Khrzhanovsky became increasingly indifferent to the proposed collaboration. “We had a falling out. Quite a deep falling out.”Questions were raised in 2011 by writer Michael Idov, who visited the Dau set and wrote about it for GQ magazine. He claimed a procession of young women were being offered “assistant” positions by Khrzhanovsky. One auditionee spoke of being questioned by him about her sex life and her willingness to perform sexual acts. When she refused, she was swiftly sent home. Further allegations surfaced this week in French newspaper Le Monde: that some of the neo-Nazi extras, led by Maxim Martsinkevich (currently serving a sentence in a penal colony for assault) repeatedly physically attacked an American artist named Andrew Ondrejcak, who was playing a psychologist on the Dau set. Ondrejcak said he was too traumatised to comment, Le Monde reported. When the Dau project began, the myth of the wild, inspired, genius-level male artist was still intact 15 years later it emerges in a changed landscape. If the allegations about Khrzhanovsky’s project were true, the #MeToo movement and exposés of Hollywood abusers such as Harvey Weinstein would cast them in a very different light. (There is no suggestion that any of the public figures involved in the project had any knowledge of these allegations.)I am finally granted my audience with Khrzhanovsky, late in the evening in Paris – and he is strenuous in his denials. We meet in Dau’s pop-up Georgian restaurant, just across the street from the Théâtre du Châtelet. He is youthful-looking, with glasses, a round face and a mop of curly black hair, shaved at the sides – a style that reminds me of Kim Jong-Un. But Khrzhanovsky is not at all despotic-seeming: he is engaged and engaging, casual and conversational. Over coffee, then whisky, and many cigarettes, in slightly broken English, he talks at length about science, art, acting, politics, and the Soviet Union.Lev Landau had a scientific formula for happiness, he tells me. It had four basic elements: love, work, friendship, freedom. “What is freedom? What is happiness? That was the initial thing I was interested in.” That and the nature of genius: “Genius people are, for me, like kind of ancient heroes. They got a gift from the gods.” That was why he cast a conductor as Dau, he explains Currentzis has the quality of genius, which no actor can portray.Does Khrzhanovsky, now 43, consider himself a genius?An only child, Khrzhanovsky grew up in Moscow surrounded by artists and intellectuals. His father, Andrey, is a renowned film-maker, whose 1968 film The Glass Harmonica became the first animated movie to be banned in the USSR. His godfather was a screenwriter named Sergei Yermolinsky, who corresponded with Tolstoy as a child and was best friends with the writer Mikhail Bulgakov. They were culturally, if not financially, privileged, he acknowledges. The Soviet Union broke up when he was 15, but Khrzhanovsky still considers himself a “Soviet person”, he says. “When I come to the United Kingdom, at border control, where the form asks, ‘Where were you born?’ I write ‘USSR’.”Dau was less about recreating Soviet conditions than examining the present day, he explains. “If something’s a fairytale, if it’s fantasy or historical, then we’re, in a way, relaxed because it’s not about us.” Soviet citizens, and Dau’s participants, submitted to totalitarian rule with eyes open today we seem to be oblivious to it, he suggests. “The system that controls us today is the cellphone. We say, ‘Oh great, I bought the new iPhone,’ or whatever. You bought something that controls you more.” He picks up his own phone from the table. “What does this thing know about us? More than we know about ourselves. We live in a transparent world, but we cannot accept it. In the same way that we cannot accept that we are on a planet moving through space when we’re sitting here.”But the retro setting was also a device to liberate human behaviour, it seems. “Because it’s not real, things happen more quickly, and they’re less risky, in a way. That’s why you can end up in a situation where you are very emotional. In normal life you would be afraid to go that far because the cost is too high.”He says he was never on set “directing” the action, but that he would talk to performers on the outside, or initiate events by bringing new people in. “I control only the rules. If the rules were wrong, I could change the rules. But I could not break the rules,” he says.Doesn’t this suggest he was as much a dictator as a director?He rejects this idea, saying that a lot of behaviour could be described as dictatorial. “You can be a dictator in your family,” he replies. “You can be a dictator in your company. You can be a dictator in your own life and destroy it.” He rejects the idea that he manipulated his actors into extreme behaviour, though. For one thing, there was no secret filming, he points out. “The people I invited were not the type who would go on a reality show. You need to respect them. And if you respect them, then they can go very far with you.”Khrzhanovsky also denies he abused his power for sexual gratification. I ask if he ever questioned interviewees or auditionees about their sex lives, as alleged. “This I never do when I am interviewing for the art department or the administrative positions. But for casting, I discuss childhood, parents, emotional things, love, sex, friendship, death… this is important, because we don’t work with actors but with real people. You talk to them about life, not acting methods.” Does he have any regrets about his treatment of women? “No. For me it makes no difference if it’s a woman or man, if you’re talking about work. Obviously there is an emotional difference between people and this is part of the beauty – but it is not determined by gender.”“There are a lot of rumours around my project,” he continues. “Then the rumours start to look like truth, then they become the truth. But it’s not the truth.” Does being Russian, and having a wealthy patron, not help? He agrees, explaining that a mutual friend introduced him to Adoniev, after the oligarch said he liked Khrzhanovsky’s film 4. But he has been the perfect patron, he says, giving the director plenty of money (he puts the figure at €25m) and left him well alone. “From the moment we met to the moment shooting finished, five years, I saw him maybe five times.” Khrzhanovsky insists that he does not have an unlimited budget. “I remember in one of our conversations he said, ‘You know, Ilya, probably you think I’m more rich than I am.’”Dau’s extravagance might seem outlandish, but its budget is probably lower than that of a typical Hollywood movie. Costs in Ukraine are low, and the crew was relatively small. Added to which, Khrzhanovsky points out, he has made 13 films out of it so far, with more to come. How much more depends on what happens when the public finally gets a chance to engage with Dau. It is time to see if Khrzhanovsky’s self-professed intuition was correct.Where can Khrzhanovsky can go next, having devoted so much of his life to this one project? Actually he has a plan, he tells me. He wants to build an experimental city of 5,000 people from around the world, where everything is recorded and everything is open and transparent. Maybe he’s joking. Coming from anyone else, it would sound utterly ridiculous. With Khrzhanovsky, you can’t be sure.• Commenting on this piece?

These fruit, bursting with sunset colours and sharp-sweet flavours, are, I believe, nature’s way of assuring us of sunnier days to come.Fondant puddings may sound like relics, but I adore them. Without the sauce, these are pretty quick to make and can easily be prepared ahead of time, ready to go in the oven just when you need them. The sauce is very good, though, and can also be made a day ahead. Omit the chilli for a child-friendly version. For the orange caramel sauce4 large oranges100g caster sugar1 tbsp Grand Marnier¼ tsp chipotle chilli flakes1 pinch saltFinely grate the zest of two oranges, to get one tablespoon. Using a small, sharp knife, top and tail all the oranges, then cut along their curves to remove the skin and pith. Place a sieve over a medium bowl. Working over the bowl, cut in between each membrane to release the segments into the sieve. Squeeze whatever is left of the oranges into the bowl – you want about 60ml juice, so save any extra for another use. Put the segments in a separate small bowl.Grease the inside of eight dariole moulds with butter, dust with the cocoa powder, shaking off any excess, then put on a baking tray.Put the butter and both chocolates in a heatproof bowl placed over a pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.In the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place, lightly whisk the eggs, extra yolk, sugar, chilli, salt, vanilla and orange zest on medium-low speed until smooth and combined, about 30 seconds. Add the melted chocolate and butter, and mix until fully combined – about 30 seconds more. Spoon into the prepared moulds, so they’re two-thirds full, then chill for at least an hour, or overnight.For the sauce, put the caster sugar in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat and cook, swirling the pan gently, until it melts and turns an amber caramel. Slowly add the orange juice, Grand Marnier, chipotle and salt, and whisk for a couple of minutes, until smooth and melted – it will sputter, so be careful. Turn off the heat, then pour the mixture over the orange segments, stirring to combine, and chill.Heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Bake the fondants straight from the fridge for 18 minutes, or until cooked on the outside and slightly wobbly in the centre. Leave to rest for a minute, then, using a tea towel, carefully unmould on to inidual plates. Serve with the sauce and, if you like, creme fraiche alongside.This impressive vegetarian main course is a delicate balancing act between sweet and savoury. It’s rich, complex and very comforting. I could eat a slice three times a day.For the tart crust100g plain flour30g wholemeal flour20g polenta1½ tsp caster sugar¾ tsp flaky salt1 tbsp sage leaves, finely chopped (about 6 leaves)80g unsalted butter, fridge-cold and cut into 1½cm cubes20ml olive oil60ml ice-cold waterFor the filling1 butternut squash, halved, deseeded and cut into ½cm-thick, skin-on half-moons (680g net weight)2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1cm rounds 2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to finish2 tbsp finely chopped sage leaves, plus 3 whole, to garnish2 tsp caraway seeds, toasted and rushed Flaky salt and black pepper1 head garlic, top cut off to expose the bulbs1 banana shallot, skin on, top trimmed to expose the flesh2-3 oranges, zest finely grated, to get 1½ tsp, and juiced, to get 160ml50ml maple syrup125g mascarpone1 small egg, beatenHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)465Fgas 9. For the crust, whisk together the first six ingredients with a good grind of pepper. Add the butter and oil, then incorporate the butter by squashing each cube between your fingers – don’t over-work it, though: you want chunks throughout the dough, so only squash it lightly. Add the water, stir to combine, then use your hands to gather the dough together – it will be quite sticky.Transfer to a very well-floured work surface and roll into a 28cm x 18cm rectangle, flouring the rolling pin, surface and pastry as you go. Fold the longer ends in towards each other, so they meet in the middle, then roll out once. Now fold in the shorter ends to meet in the middle, roll out once more, then fold in half, so you end up with a square. Use your hands to stretch the dough into a 14cm circle, then wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes.While the dough is chilling, toss the squash and carrots in the oil, a tablespoon of chopped sage, the caraway, a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Spread out on two large oven trays lined with baking paper don’t worry if there is some overlap. Drizzle the garlic and shallot with a little oil, wrap both separately in foil, and put on one tray.Roast the butternut and carrots for 25 minutes, or until golden brown, then remove from the oven. Leave the garlic and shallot to roast for 15 minutes more, then remove and, once cool enough to handle, squeeze out the flesh and finely chop. Turn down the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7. Transfer the dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 30cm circle, dusting the rolling pin as you go. Gently lift the dough on to a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper and refrigerate for another 30 minutes.Put the orange juice and maple syrup in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat and cook for about 10 minutes, or until it reduces to the consistency of a thick, sticky syrup.In a small bowl, mix the mascarpone with the chopped roast garlic and shallot, the orange zest and remaining chopped sage. Season with a pinch of salt and plenty of pepper, and stir again to combine.Spread the mascarpone mixture over the dough, leaving a 4cm border around the edge. Scatter the butternut and carrot haphazardly over the top, to cover, then drizzle over the orange caramel.Fold the edges of the pastry up and over the filling, brush the exposed pastry with the egg, then bake for 30 minutes, until crisp and golden brown. Leave to cool for 20 minutes, then serve with the remaining sage leaves roughly torn over the top.These are like sweet arancini. They are very impressive served at the end of a dinner party, and aren’t at all heavy. They can be prepared to the chilling stage up to a day in advance, so you’ll just need to fry them and serve. The sauce can also be made a day ahead.90g small pearl tapioca420ml whole milk120ml double cream1 tsp vanilla paste½ tsp ground star anise 3 tbsp caster sugar⅓ tsp flaked sea salt1 egg, separated, plus 1 extra yolk 3 oranges, zest of 1 finely grated, to get 1½ tsp75g runny honey2 whole star anise15g tapioca flour500ml sunflower oil, for frying10g icing sugar, to dustPut the tapioca in a medium-sized, heavy-based, cast-iron saucepan with 120ml of the milk and leave to soak for 20 minutes. Add the remaining milk, the cream, vanilla and ground star anise, place on a medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Add the sugar and salt, lower the heat to medium and cook for 12 minutes, stirring often, until the tapioca turns translucent and chewy, and the pudding has thickened.In a small bowl, whisk the two egg yolks with three tablespoons of the tapioca mixture, then tip back into the saucepan. Switch off the heat, and stir continuously for about a minute, until the yolks have blended into the pudding, but not scrambled. Stir in the orange zest, then pour into a bowl and leave to cool for about 15 minutes.Beat the egg white to medium-firm peaks, stir into the pudding, then cover the surface with clingfilm, to prevent a skin forming. Transfer to the fridge to set – at least 90 minutes, or overnight.Juice two of the oranges, to give you 80ml. Using a small, sharp knife, trim the top and tail off the remaining orange, then cut down its curves to remove the skin and pith. Release the segments by cutting between the membranes, then cut each segment in half. Now make the syrup. Put the orange juice, honey, 30ml water and the whole star anise in a small saucepan and bring to a boil on a medium-high heat. Leave to bubble away for about 10 minutes, until reduced by half, then turn off the heat, stir in the orange segments and leave to cool completely. Meanwhile, stir the tapioca flour into the pudding mixture until combined.Heat the oil in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, take about 35g of the tapioca mixture and shape into a rough ball with your hands it will be very sticky, so you may prefer to wear gloves. Gently drop the ball into the hot oil and, working quickly now, make another four balls, so you cook about five at a time, until deeply golden on the outside and warmed through the centre – about four to five minutes. Transfer the cooked balls to a tray lined with kitchen towel, and repeat with the remaining tapioca mix. You should end up with 15 balls in all.Divide the syrup between four plates, top each serving with three tapioca balls (save the three extra ones for seconds), dust with icing sugar and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722ff4ddbea93b8bb40fa50eb49f113c75bd83bd/0_133_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b6e2bbc76aae6010e5d5d8886011cd5","title":"accrington stanley v derby county fa cup fourth round live","story":"3 min: Accrington midfielder Daniel Barlaser gets booked for a late lunge on Harry Wilson. 2 min: Accrington goalkeeper Jonny Maxted gets an early touch, placing the ball for a goal-kick and booting it long over the halfway line. 2 min: Derby County work the ball down the left and Mason Mount sends a cross in from the left. It’s headed clear.1 min: the home side get the ball rolling on what looks a sunny but crisp and fresh afternoon in Accrington. Accrington wear all reed, while Derby County are in all white kit. The pitch looks a bit threadbare and is quite muddy in spots.Not long now: There’s nothing so glamorous as a tunnel at the Wham Stadium, so the teams congregate outside the poky dressing-rooms and amble out on to the pitch ledf by referee Jon Moss. Kick-off is just a minute or two away. It’s a sell-out: The “House Full” signs are up outside Wham Stadium, where all 5,400 tickets have been sold for today’s game. Derby have taken 2,600 supporters, which should make for a terrific atmosphere.John Coleman speaks: Speaking to BT Sport, Accrington’s manager, who masterminded his team’s ascent from the seventh to the third tier of English football, sounds very bullish about his team’s chances. “I find it funny, to be honest,” he says, when asked about people considering this match a bye for Derby. “A lot of teams have come to this ground expecting a bye and they’ve gone home with their tails between their legs.”Asked about the ethos of the club and its players, he has this to say. “Players have to buy into the team spirit. I want my players to make loads of money, but they’re not going to do with that us. What we can do, however, is give them a platform from which to showcase their talent and work ethic and hopefully we’ll get two or three years out of them before they move elsewhere. If we can make a few quid out of them in the process, all the better.” Frank Lampard speaks: “It’s a tough job, a great test for us and it’s the reverse of what we’ve done in the cups so far,” says Derby’s manager, in an interview with BT Sport. “I’ve named a strong team but we go week by week, there’s not so many midweek games this month but we do not have many options across the back, so the team picks itself to a degree. I’ve put a couple of young lads in there and they’re ready to give it a go.”Accrington are without midfielder Sam Finley, who has been given a five-game ban for violent after appearing to stamp on Charlton’s Lyle Taylor last weekend. Goalkeeper Jonny Maxted is available after having his red card for an incident in the same game overturned. For Derby, Tom Lawrence, Scott Carson and Andre Wisdom are all out injured, while Ashley Cole is unlikely to be fit enough to play despite signing for the Rams earlier this week. Accrington and Derby County meet for the very first time in a competitive football match, with a place in the fifth round of the FA Cup up for grabs. League One side Accrington have already beaten Championship opposition, having beaten Ipswich in the third round, while Derby County also punched above their weight. Frank Lampard’s side went through on penalties after a third round replay against Southampton. Accrington’s 5,400-capacity Wham Stadium is the venue for this afternoon’s encounter and kick-off is at 12.30pm (GMT).

There has been no systematic study or formal data collection exercise.Another community activist, who did not wish to be named, said she was aware of 15-20 recent cases in Croydon alone.“It’s usually done in the UK, not abroad like female genital mutilation (FGM),” she said, describing a practice whereby mothers, aunties or grandmothers use a hot stone to massage across the breast repeatedly in order to “break the tissue” and slow its growth.“Sometimes they do it once a week, or once every two weeks, depending on how it comes back,” she added.The perpetrators, usually mothers, consider it a traditional measure which protects girls from unwanted male attention, sexual harassment and rape. Medical experts and victims regard it as child abuse which could lead to physical and psychological scars, infections, inability to breastfeed, deformities and breast cancer.The United Nations describes it as one of five global under-reported crimes relating to gender-based violence.One woman living in the suburbs of an English city told the  how she went about ironing her daughter’s chest at the first sign of puberty.British-Somali anti-FGM campaigner and psychotherapist Leyla Hussein said she has spoken to five women in her north London clinic who had been victims of breast-ironing.“They were all British women, all British citizens,” Hussein said. One of the women said she became flat-chested as a result of the practice, said Hussein. “She kept saying: ‘I have a boy’s chest.’ But no one has ever questioned her about it. No one had physically checked her. This was in north London, just down the road,” said Hussein.“I was a nurse in the UK for over 10 years and watched the numbers grow,” said Jennifer Miraj, who worked in hospitals in Essex, Glasgow, Birmingham and London until 2015. Miraj said she came across confirmed cases of breast-ironing in approximately 15 adults and eight girls.“I took care of a young 10-year-old girl who had an infection, which had been going on for a few years from ironing,” she said, describing a case from Broomfield hospital in Essex.Mary Claire, a church minister in Wolverhampton, said she had spoken to four victims in Leeds, originally from west Africa. “You could see the marks,” she said.Police say they have fielded no allegations about breast-ironing in the UK, but suspect it is happening.“If I knew it was happening, I would do something about it,” said the Insp Allen Davis from the Met police.“Prosecutions are really important,” he added. “People have to recognise these practices for what they are – child abuse.”“It is surprising to me that the police and other authorities are not allocating even the resources clearly needed to deal with this horrific phenomenon,” said Alex Carlile, one of UK’s leading QCs, who is a former deputy high court judge and a member of the House of Lords.“Surely it’s high time for the police and prosecuting authorities to address and tackle the issue in a robust manner, sensitive to the personal issues that arise for young victims and their communities.”“It’s not only an issue of funding, it is also an issue of political will to tackle something that historically has been accepted as a cultural practice,” said Conservative MP Maria Miller, who also chairs the women’s and equalities select committee in parliament.“I think public service providers have to start being more honest and realistic about some of the things they are encountering, and to have the support to challenge what are abusive and barbaric practices, particularly aimed against children,” she added.The government has said it is “absolutely committed” to stamping out the practice. But activists and social workers say that little has been done thus far.“Nothing came out of this – nothing!” said campaigner Geraldine Yenwo of Cawogido. “We talk about early marriage and violence against women and girls but no one ever mentions breast-ironing,” she added.Nyuydzewira, who was herself subjected to the abuse as a girl, said British authorities were not taking the problem seriously, and have not prosecuted those doing breast-ironing on their children on grounds of it being seen as a “cultural practice”.“The British people are so polite in the sense that when they see something like that, they think of cultural sensitivities,” she said. “But if it’s a cultural practice that is harming children … any harm that is done to a little girl, whether in public or in secrecy, that person should be held accountable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25a04a73978f73e0ad1f07e7725e5bbebe7eb007/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1d4b2c8cc1ed56cc716c50c33cb617e","title":"uk authorities in denial of prevalence of parents breast ironing girls","story":"Practice that aims to slow girls’ physical development is both ineffective and dangerous, say doctorsIn a quiet suburban house on the outskirts of a city in northern England, Maureen* – a mother of two in her late 30s – sits cradling a large dark stone in the palm of her hand.She had just been using it to crush spices for a family meal. But a few years ago, she was using it for a very different purpose.She heated the stone and then pressed against the chest of her eight-year-old daughter. She stopped only when her daughter cried out in pain and the heat from the stone had left a bruise on the child’s body.The practice is aimed at slowing physical maturity in girls to spare them the unwanted attention and predation of young men while they are still minors. But doctors say it does little to delay breast development, and threatens all kinds of physical and psychological harm.The intervention is not confined to this city. A  investigation heard anecdotal evidence of dozens of cases in London, Leeds, Essex and Wolverhampton.Yet British authorities, social workers and some NGOs appear to be unaware or in denial that the practice exists in the UK and are not taking a proactive approach to find or even keep track of the cases.Police say the obvious problem is that children are unlikely to report their parents, and few other people will ever get to know it is going on.“What we wouldn’t expect is a victim to necessarily walk into a police station and report what is happening to them,” says Allen Davis, the politan police’s lead on illegal culture practice. “If people were to tell us where it’s happening, when, to whom and by whom – then we will do something about it.”“Like FGM, cultural practices that harm children or adults are complex issues to solve,” says Jess Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley. “However, we must do all we can to educate communities against the practices and seek to prosecute perpetrators and protect victims.”Maureen says that having had her own breast ironed when she was a child in Cameroon, she became convinced this would help her protect her own daughter from harm, especially when she noticed her beginning to develop.“The area where we were living – it wasn’t a good area,” she says, describing youth gangs walking the streets, fighting and peddling cannabis. “I couldn’t let her play outside.“When you saw her, you couldn’t see the baby in her – you just saw a teenager. So for me it was really a nightmare.”Maureen called her mother in Cameroon, who guided her through the process.“We have chat groups most weeks and women have talked about breast-ironing,” says Karyne Tazi, the executive director of the Women \u0026amp Families Resource Centre in Wolverhampton, who works to educate women on the risks of the practice.“You’re thinking about it like a vaccine: ‘It’s painful but it helps,’” says Tazi, adding that the practice has serious physical, psychological and overall health effects that many people are simply not aware about.Jennifer Miraj, a nurse, recalls seeing dozens of cases of women and girls who had been breast-ironed while she worked in hospitals around the UK.She says she saw “women who couldn’t breastfeed and had long-term issues with cysts and infections from the milk ducts not being able to express the little milk they were producing”.Cathy Aba Fouda, who was subjected to breast-ironing in Cameroon, where the practice is thought to originate, also says that there have been cases of women who had been breast-ironed developing breast cancer.“We lost a young woman only last month who had been breast-ironed as a girl and died from breast cancer, aged just 24,” says Fouda. “I don’t know why no one has done a study on the link between the two.”Psychological problems are also very common following breast-ironing and can last for years, according to Fouda. “When I had a baby, all the trauma came flooding back,” she says, explaining that whenever the child reached for her chest, she felt panic like someone was about to hurt her.Yet some UK-based community activists appear to be unaware of the risks.“I haven’t seen any research which said that breast-ironing is bad,” says Mary, adding that some women say it improves the mother-daughter bond. “Up to now I haven’t heard that it’s related to cancer.”“The only thing is that the nipple sort of goes into inverse, and it makes it very difficult if you have to breastfeed.”“FGM, breast-ironing – it fundamentally comes back to the control over women’s bodies,” says the anti-FGM activist Leyla Hussein, who also provides therapy to breast-ironing survivors.“The whole community needs an education,” says Mary Stella in Wolverhampton. “Because we are coming from a background where we think it’s OK.”Nazir Afzal, a former chief prosecutor for north-west England, says that introducing a specific law against breast-ironing could help, citing a similar experience with the criminalisation of forced marriage. “Sometimes you need to change a law to send out a message,” he says.But others believe this would spell disaster and would push the practice even further underground. “Look at FGM: from 1985 till now they are still looking for somebody to prosecute – is that not ridiculous?” says Mary.“Going around in a sympathetic way saying: ‘Do you know anyone undergoing this?’ so that they can latch on to that child like a tonne of bricks – that’s not support, is it?”Tazi says interventions need to be subtle. “More organisations need to have the resources and opportunities to get these communities to talk. Because if they don’t talk, it will always be an underground crime … But the more people talk about it, the more we’ll find solutions.“When we first started, you hold a chat group on breast-ironing and labia pulling and no one would turn up. But they’ve seen us: we’re there, we’re constant, we try to work with them around it, not criminalise them. And they’re now more open to talking,” says Tazi.In Maureen’s case, her daughter was held by social services for 10 days before being released back to her family. Maureen faced no criminal charges, only a police caution.“A social worker would come around once a week for one or two months, that’s all. After then, they just dropped the case,” she says. Maureen moved her daughter to another school."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/841559dcc68c300b459d547d90c82442ce3bcd80/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=808ce3d006ca848781dc25577967fdd1","title":"blind date faris alexandra","story":"Faris, 25, trainee lawyer, meets Alexandra, 30, garden and landscape designerWhat were you hoping for?A fun and relaxed evening with a potential love interest.First impressions?Pretty, confident and interested in what I had to say.What did you talk about?Garden design, Filipino cuisine, rogue housemates and Alex’s book club.Any awkward moments?Just waiting on opposite train platforms after saying goodbye.Good table manners?Very good.

I don’t think she was best pleasedI met Freddy while I was at university. I introduced him to my sister. They hit it off and ended up in a relationship for six years. But then he got a new job and had to move away, and they broke up. By then, Freddy was a good friend and we kept in touch. I went travelling last year and heard Freddy was travelling, too, and that he would be homeless when he got back. I was planning to return at the same time, so I suggested we moved in together. My sister and I are very close. I don’t think she was best pleased – but only because she wanted me to move in with her. Perhaps she finds the situation a bit strange when she comes to visit, but it’s no big deal because I can go to her house instead.Freddy and I have a very intimate relationship, similar to that of a brother and sister. I feel protective about him. It’s a stronger bond than I have with any of my other friends. My friendship with Alice solidified when I was seeing her sister, Harriet, so I made an effort to keep in contact with her afterwards. Alice is an awesome person to have as a friend, and because the breakup with her sister was not traumatic, it meant Harriet and I stayed friends as well. I’m glad I don’t have to house-share with a stranger. We’re both quite laid-back, but because I work in art galleries installing exhibitions, I’m interested in the fine details of stuff. I’m probably quite annoying in that respect. I like things to be neat and tidy, and will make furniture to sort out a problem. Alice is really good at letting me do that stuff.

And also my body. My skin, hair, nails – it’s all fair game. That’s how women are conditionedIt’s the summer of 2016 and things aren’t going well. Yes, there is Brexit and yes, Donald Trump, but also my heart is aching. It’s an all-consuming ache that gets worse by the hour as my brain keeps raising the stakes from “We’re just not compatible” to “This was the love of my life and I ruined it!” I crave tangible change I can hold on to. Change that will deliver me to a new life where I’m not just living one breakup to another. So I, a Middle Eastern woman with olive skin, dye my hair blond.I dye my hair blond thinking it will come out white and I’ll look like a real life Storm from X Men. I dye my hair blond because the girls I see in fashion editorials and on the lady-centric clickbait sites I use, like an opiate to numb all brain activity, have white-blond hair that alludes to a wild interior life, exactly like the wild interior life I’d like to allude to. I dye my hair blond because all of my worth is placed in the way I look.I fail to observe that the women I’m trying to channel are all model types with no bad angles or body fat. I also fail to observe they are all white. I go in with photos of St Vincent and leave eight hours later with a frizzy halo of what looks and feels like a cheap wig. It’s grey, but not like the electric, explosive grey of St Vincent. It’s grey like I’m out of focus. My statement hair makes the statement “… meh”.When life hurts, I blame my face. And also my body. My skin, hair, nails – it’s all fair game. This is something I’ve been programmed to do and that I recognise in the women I know intimately. We learned young: any kind of praise included a mention of beauty, and when you’re brainwashed to equate beauty with goodness, the reverse becomes true too. At your most powerless, you think if only you could strong-arm your way to beauty it would erase the ugly in your life.When I was 19, I returned home from my freshman year of college a self-pity zombie, living one nap to the next, marinating in the kind of heartbreak only a teenager could manufacture from a one-month relationship. I had fallen in love with a cotton-candy-haired coke-head from Delhi I’d met in a support group for cutters. As you do. She took my virginity, told me she loved me, then left me waiting on her doorstep for hours. I was closeted, heartbroken and finally allowed my parents to talk me into the nose job they’d been lobbying for since puberty.The nose job is a problematic Iranian rite of passage I had spent years successfully dodging, but my defences were down. I probably would have undergone a lobotomy if someone told me it would turn me into a muse. Of course, rhinoplasty didn’t improve my face or my confidence. I returned for the next year of school, still lonely and horny, with a slightly smaller profile.Between March and October last year, I spent all my waking hours in pitch black rooms, in post production on The Bisexual, a series I co-wrote, direct and star in. It was seven months of swimming in my mistakes, trying to cobble together the least shameful product possible with the footage. I couldn’t be more proud of the series now, but at the time I was exhausted, insecure and scared. When you’re sitting in a black 10ft x 10ft editing suite throughout the hottest UK summer on record, watching yourself struggle to remember lines while you simulate sex, you start to look for answers where you can get them – which is how I came to spend hundreds of pounds on a 15-step Korean skincare regime that definitely did not work.This isn’t really about beauty. I know this because the process of staring at myself on screen all day doesn’t faze me. My ego lies in the work. I could look like Sloth from The Goonies, but if the scene works, I’m happy. It was the lack of control I felt as a director, the remorse over rushed scenes and squandered takes that kept me up at night. When I’m making something, my face and body are just a vehicle, acting in service of a larger goal. Unfortunately, the fact that it felt as though I’d failed to reach that goal made me want to turn right back to obsessing over my face and body.This is about power. More specifically, how women perceive it and are conditioned to see their place in it. We’re raised to believe that beauty is power, but that is a lie meant to distract you, keep you obedient, lull you into a calm stupor where the source of your problems is that you’re just not hot enough. Or at least it was for me.The new nose has had no meaningful impact on my life beyond the shock value I get from people who discover I’ve had plastic surgery. The Korean skincare regime is in the bin, and for a little over a year after I bleached my hair, I was left living with a daily reminder of my stupidity every time I ran my hands through my straw-like mane. So the next time I find myself rationalising the purchase of a microneedle roller thingy you’re supposed to drag across your face eight times in 16 different angles until you start to look like Hellraiser, I will ask myself: “What am I chasing and why?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42d85780076468b516c0ed1cbb4c188d1294f8c/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac23a0ce5c1c0f925378a91b8afe8ea6","title":"10 simple signs that youve turned into a responsible adult","story":"Being a child meant no responsibilities. Being adolescent meant ignoring them. But now that you’re a grownup, there’s no running away. Thankfully, there are 10 simple ways to show you’re tackling adulthood like a proRecyclingThere was a time when all your rubbish went into one bin. Not any more. Now it’s a military operation – food, paper, cardboard, bottles and plastic all need to be separated and placed in specific colour-coded containers. But you’re well-drilled, you know the weekly collection rota and you have all the rubbish out the night before. You’ve nailed it.Weekly shopsNo more grazing on sweets in corner shops or picking up a ready meal on the way home from work. You climb in the car on Saturday mornings and drive to a supermarket on the outskirts of town and buy enough groceries to last you all week, resulting in a three-figure bill. Or you order it all online and have it delivered. But it still takes one simple thing that demonstrates you’re an adult: forward planning.Growing plants and vegetablesThis was something that once struck you as OAP behaviour and, frankly, back-breaking work. Then you discovered homegrown vegetables actually taste better and that growing a few plants is good for the soul. Now you visit garden centres and buy tools. Don’t eat at the garden centre cafe, though, that really is for old folk.Work the central heatingIt feels like you have two choices: hand over half your salary to the energy company or freeze. Real adults have mastered the central heating thermostat and the boiler timer and save money and energy as a result. It’s not rocket science, after all. Bonus tip: sign up to EnergyCheck from Compare the Market and it’ll contact you if you could save money on your bill.CleanOnce upon a time, your parents made you clean your room and it felt like punishment. Now you have your own place that is entirely your responsibility to take care of. You embrace it, grab some dusters, spray furniture polish, put on some music and bask in the thrill of sparkling surfaces.Stack the dishwasher correctlyYou used to balk at the washing up. Now you have a dishwasher and know that by arranging the plates at the back, bowls at the front, cutlery upright and cups on the top, it functions properly. Simple chore – such ordered joy.VotingCouncil election, general election, referendum – no matter what it is, you always find the time to vote. When you were younger, you didn’t even know where the polling station was, but then you realised you were making a huge mistake. It was your future they were deciding, after all.Assembling furnitureAs a kid, your parents expected you to make your bed. Now, when you buy one, you actually have to assemble it, too. In fact, all new furniture comes flatpacked, necessitating a crash course in DIY, a properly stocked toolbox and the ability to follow a badly translated set of instructions.Hold a dinner partyGetting a pizza in for the big match is a thing of the past. Now it’s all couples and entertaining. In best MasterChef style, you can prepare and cook at least three dishes, because melting cheese on nachos and buying an M\u0026ampS cheesecake just doesn’t cut it any more.Going to bed at a sensible timeStaying up until dawn gaming or clubbing might be possible at the weekend, but midweek you need a full eight hours or you’re tetchy the next day. Then you get run-down, and you know what happens when you get rundown: it all goes horribly wrong.Prove you’re an adult and download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

From planning meals to advice on decreasing the time you spend managing bills, here are some handy online resources to help tackle time-consuming everyday tasksThere are a few things in life that are seemingly never-ending: taxes, bills and housework, for example. According to research by the Association of Accounting Technicians, adults carry out an average of 109 life-admin tasks a year. The poll, which surveyed 2,000 Britons, found more than half of those taking part struggle to keep up with household paperwork and failed to complete everything by the required date.It also found that four urgent and important tasks are always in the pipeline. Mustering the effort to get them done is another issue altogether, but putting in a bit of effort can save a lot of time – and stress – in the long run. Here are some tips on how to keep on top of things.Offload meal prepEven with an Instagram-worthy pantry, sometimes just deciding what to eat for dinner can be a drain. Luckily, in the past few years, there has been a boom in subscription services. Companies such as HelloFresh allow you to choose up to five meals a week and have all the ingredients and recipes delivered to your door. Allplants is similar but caters to vegans, while Graze will sort out your snacks, and Naked Wines will make sure to deliver some nice wine to enjoy with whatever you cook.Get reminders whenever you can save money on billsCompare the Market has made it simple with EnergyCheck, a service that automatically checks if you could get a better deal than your current energy supplier. Tell them your gas and electricity usage once and you’ll never have to overpay again. Choose your ideal saving amount (£50 or £100, for example) and update your preferences on the go. You’ll get alerts to let you know if you can save, or if you’re still on a great deal – and you can switch energy providers simply.Cut time on managing billsManaging bills and paying them on time is one of the most common life-admin tasks and one that can have expensive consequences if they are not dealt with on time. Apps such as Splitwise help split bills between groups – such as housemates – so everyone pays a fair share and knows exactly what they owe. WonderBill gets all your household bills in one place, so there is no sifting through piles of paperwork or old emails to figure out which one needs to be paid and when.Automate your savingsSaving money can be a strain if you’re struggling to budget. But bank apps and money bots are great for finding ways to stockpile your piggy bank. Some allow users to set up savings “pots”, which automatically round up purchases to the nearest pound and collect the leftover change, which adds up surprisingly quickly. Then there are AI chatbots such as Cleo or Plum, which take the thinking out of money management by learning their users’ spending habits and sending out personalised prompts that remind them to put a little bit away for a rainy day.Make the most of your appsHaving all your devices sync together and talk seamlessly can save you a lot of time. If This Then That (IFTTT) is a platform that helps make this a reality. It allows you to create customised “applets” and use ones others have created to make day-to-day tasks a little bit easier. It works on the premise of “if this happens, then that happens”. So, for example, if you complete a workout on a fitness app then Google logs it in your calendar.Clean up your computerOne way to save time before you even begin a life-admin task is having everything properly organised – including on your computer. But, with all the photos, files, and apps that gradually pile up, organising your laptop can be a major life-admin task in itself. Using apps such as Hazel will help automatically organise files based on name, date and file type – plus you can have it rename files and sort them into subfolders so they can be accessed, deleted or backed up. To start automating your life, download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

But there was more tangibly good news from the House of Lords, which approved the government’s much-delayed plan to limit charges landlords and letting agents can levy on tenants in England. More than two years after the tenant fees bill was proposed by the chancellor, it is finally due to become law this summer.While it will only apply to tenancy agreements signed after the start of June, the savings for tenants will be immediate and substantial.Landlords and their agents will be banned from charging tenants for credit checks, inventories and references. At an average cost of £272 per person, such red tape can be eye-wateringly expensive especially since it often comes at the start of a tenancy, when tenants also have to pay a deposit and their first month’s rent in advance.Most galling of all, these checks serve the interests of two sets of people, neither of them the tenants.While some fees provide reassurance to landlords, others – such as spurious charges for drawing up “cut and paste” tenancy agreements – merely line the pockets of letting agents.The fees are a symptom of a system which is tilted in favour of property owners and their agents, rather than tenants. Take credit checks for example. Landlords, quite understandably, like to know a would-be tenant’s credit history. But letting agents like to charge applicants, rather than landlords, for the privilege. Running an online credit check can cost just a few pounds, yet many agents charge more than £50.So good riddance to such egregious charges – it’s just a shame that it has taken so long for the ban to come into force.Unsurprisingly, the bill has faced fierce opposition from landlords and letting agents, and with so much parliamentary time taken up by Brexit, its passage through Westminster has been glacial. Even though its lobbying has ultimately failed to block it, the industry has had plenty of time to prepare for the ban – and no-one expects it to take the new rules lying down.The new law is detailed and specific, capping deposits and banning many of the most common charges. But there are a couple of loopholes: agents will still be able to penalise tenants if they pay their rent late or lose their keys, so anyone who makes that mistake can expect to be hit hard.The timing of the ban is particularly awkward for lettings professionals. It is an industry built on volume – it needs a steady throughput of new tenancies to keep the money coming in. The current slowdown in the market, and the slowing pace of rent increases, are already squeezing margins.That’s why the fees are so valuable. In an ironic twist, many were introduced by struggling agents a decade ago during the property crash now, once again, they’re a crucial revenue stream.Once the bill becomes law, agents will face a tough choice – take the hit or charge landlords more. Neither is particularly attractive, as the sluggish market means there is intense competition for landlords’ business, and raising fees more than a rival could lose valuable clients.The pressure will be particularly acute on the high street where agents have higher overheads than their online rivals. There are about 16,000 branches around the country, many single-office operations which could be forced to merge with rivals to survive. Even the bigger agents, listed on the stock market, will face pressure from shareholders over what they are doing to protect their profit margins.In the longer term, agents will have little choice but to find ways to recoup their lost income. Charging landlords a higher commission to find tenants and manage properties is an obvious starting point, but they could also do to property owners what they did to renters a decade ago – introduce new admin fees.But as the whole thing comes full circle, tenants should be wary of schadenfreude – as landlords are likely to respond to their additional costs by putting up rents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

Cooper’s amendment has already won the backing of more than 70 cross-party MPs, among them a number of Conservatives.This month an earlier Cooper amendment to restrict the chances of no deal was passed with the support of 20 Conservatives, However, while just three Labour MPs went against the party line in that vote, there is speculation that more could rebel on Tuesday.The new amendment, which seems likely to be among those selected for a vote, would guarantee parliamentary time for a private members’ bill drafted by Cooper that would extend article 50 to the end of 2019 if Theresa May failed to secure a deal by late February.Some Labour MPs representing seats that voted leave in the 2016 referendum have warned that the plan could appear to be endlessly extending the Brexit process for no reason.Labour sources said some MPs – over and above the half a dozen or so who have voted with the government on May’s Brexit plan – had come to the whips’ office to express reservations about the Cooper amendment.Some are concerned that it could be used to pave the way for a second referendum, and they are expected to study the amendment over the weekend before coming to a final position.Nandy said: “Without a clear reason, people will understandably think we’re just kicking this into the long grass and the ongoing chaos is making it impossible for local businesses.”Another obstacle would be what to do with European elections due to take place in late May if Brexit were delayed beyond then, Nandy said.“I haven’t yet heard any convincing explanation that would avoid us then having to campaign to re-elect MEPs to a parliament we were supposed to have left months earlier. That just strikes me as completely unsustainable,” she said. “So I haven’t dismissed the amendment out of hand, as avoiding no deal is clearly important, but there are serious problems with it as it currently stands.”On Friday, Andrea Leadsom became the first leave-backing cabinet minister to acknowledge that the Brexit deadline could be extended beyond 29 March, though only briefly.The leader of the Commons, who is in charge of guiding Brexit legislation through parliament, told BBC’s Newsnight that a short extension was feasible: “I am absolutely certain that if we needed a couple of extra weeks or something, then that would be feasible.”The parallel issue of a possible second Brexit referendum remains the subject intense debate within Labour, with a senior ally of Jeremy Corbyn warning that it could badly affect the relationship between politicians and the public.Ian Lavery, the MP for Wansbeck and Labour’s national campaigns coordinator, said that while the idea was still possible under party policy as a way to end an otherwise intractable Brexit impasse, he was worried about the consequences.“We should be in no doubt that asking the voters to vote again on an issue they have already given an answer, until they come up with the right answer, risks serious damage to the relationship between many citizens and politicians at Westminster,” he wrote in an article for the .Earlier in the week, a planned cross-party amendment for a “people’s vote” was dropped by its organisers, who said the lack of explicit Labour front-bench backing meant it was unlikely to pass.However, the Commons order paper for Tuesday’s crucial series of votes on the next stages for Brexit now features three new amendments tabled by Labour MPs seeking the same.On Saturday, campaigners from the People’s Vote campaign were promising to hold events in about 100 places across the UK to maintain the pressure for a second referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ca14bb30a7cb907f26cafa29ba918bbcd89f080/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c510693356c5025cd6ba01bd44bdba3","title":"european medicines agency closes london office with loss of 900 jobs brexit","story":"European Medicines Agency heads for Amsterdam 63 days before BrexitThe European Medicines Agency, one of the biggest EU regulators and one of the first casualties of Brexit, has closed its doors in the UK for the last time with the loss of 900 jobs.Staff lowered and folded up the 28 national flags that adorned the lobby in London’s Canary Wharf headquarters on Friday night and bid farewell before moving to their new offices in Amsterdam.The EMA evaluates medicines throughout the EU but was forced to relocate to the Dutch capital because pharmaceuticals regulation should be done in a member state. Amsterdam won the bid to host the agency in 2017.Its departure from London was widely lamented as it marks not just the loss of highly skilled jobs but the UK’s central place in pharmaceutical evaluation and monitoring.In a tweet on Friday evening, the agency said its executive director thanked staff for their contribution over the past 24 years.Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, said it was a “very sad day for the UK” and “a great day for the Netherlands”.Simon Fraser, the vice chair of Chatham House and the former permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, said: “Losing the European Medicines Agency HQ is a significant loss for London and for the UK.”The decision made by the EU to move the EMA was a body blow to those who have spent a lifetime charting the progress of medicines through evaluation and testing cycles.In September it emerged that Britain’s leading role in evaluating new medicines for sale to patients across the EU had collapsed with no more work coming from Europe because of Brexit.The head of the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry, Mike Thompson, said at the time it was akin to watching a “British success story” being broken up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebb573281467845123c913d9421c2a30fed36dbb/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c7b6e3c51370d323220fac24c7a5cd","title":"young people how do you feel about your future","story":"With 18-year-olds watching the outcome of Brexit unravel in front of them, we want to hear what you thinkFor years, it has been assumed that young people do not vote, do not take part in politics, and do not care.

Exeter’s England international is 6ft 4in and weighs more than 15st, taller and heavier than most second rows not long before the 25-year-old was born, but not sufficiently bulky to be tasked with battering his way into traffic and over the gainline.Slade is a playmaker – not quite a species on the brink of extinction, but an increasing rarity in a period of the game when collisions predominate. Exeter’s Champions Cup match at Munster last weekend was an example of how an attempt to wear down opponents now goes on for 80 minutes. There was no let-up from either side with the commitment of the players absolute it cried out for the craft of a player such as Slade but the three-quarters were largely peripheral despite the sustained pace of the game.The match in Dublin on Saturday between the two countries who have won the Six Nations since the last World Cup, Ireland last year and England in the two before that, promises to be just as full-blooded and uncompromising. England lacked ball-carriers on their last visit to the Aviva Stadium in March 2017: Billy Vunipola was making his first start of the Six Nations campaign and lacked his usual thrust, his brother Mako was on the bench and the back ision then was made up of quick and elusive players.Eddie Jones took the power route in November, Ben Te’o and Joe Cokanasiga starting with Manu Tuilagi on the bench against Australia. With Owen Farrell starting at outside-half instead of George Ford, Slade became the second playmaker at 13, a position he has settled in after starting his senior career at outside-half before being used at 12 and at full-back.“My game is putting others into space,” he says. “I would not say I am small, but I am not like a typical big ball-carrier. I am an extra playmaker and communicator for the side so that we take opportunities when they come.”Slade was first capped by England before the 2015 World Cup, partnering Sam Burgess in the midfield against France at Twickenham. He was chosen in the squad for the tournament but played only in the match against Uruguay at the end of the group stage when England had no hope of making the knockout stage, again at 13. He missed Jones’s first Six Nations campaign because of injury and has tasted only five minutes of action in the championship, against Italy as a replacement in 2017, but he went to Portugal last week to prepare for the encounter against Ireland having started six of England’s last seven internationals.“Last year was a really good one for me with England and Exeter,” says Slade. “It was disappointing not to win the Premiership again and we are doing everything this season to put ourselves in a position to give it another shot. I was pleased to get the amount of game time that I had with England and I am trying to do enough to make sure I keep the shirt.“I feel that 13 is my position now, although I am happy to play anywhere. It does not really matter what number you have on your back, even in defence at set pieces because you can set up with 13 defending at 12. When it comes to phase play, most teams have players across the pitch who can handle and the attacking shape is pretty fluid so your number does not have too much bearing.”England started last year’s Six Nations with a comfortable victory over Italy in Rome and held on to overcome Wales at Twickenham before the chariot became stuck in reverse. A first defeat to Scotland for 10 years was followed by a loss against France in Paris before Ireland came to Twickenham and clinched the grand slam. It was England’s first home defeat in the championship since 2012 and they lost the first two Tests in South Africa the following June.“Sport is not all smooth sailing,” says Slade. “We had a good run a while ago and last year we suffered a bit of a dip. That is when you learn a lot about yourselves: we took some criticism and that gives you the kick up the arse that you need because it is in adversity that you find your true character and become fired by the desire to do better. We finished the South Africa series with a victory and had some good performances and results in the autumn. I think we are in a really good space going into the Six Nations and as a squad we are confident.”Jones has changed his approach to this year’s Six Nations after their worst campaign since 2006. His squad for the eight days in Portugal was made up entirely of players he believed would be fit for selection against Ireland. That initially meant there was no place for the player who Slade replaced in the side in South Africa, Jonathan Joseph, who made his first appearance of the season for Bath at Toulouse last weekend. After playing for 52 minutes and suffering no ill-effects, Joseph was called up, but having made just one appearance since the middle of last April he would appear to be more in line for a place on the bench than a starting position.“I am in possession of the jersey but there is a lot of competition and players are putting their hands up,” says Slade. “I was pleased with how it went in November, when in our only defeat we pushed New Zealand all the way and had a late try disallowed, and am looking forward, if selected, to helping us build on that. Eddie keeps in touch, texting after games to say how he thinks things have gone and in this environment you can never stand still.“We intend to use the Six Nations to keep building and make sure that we are in the best place possible when the World Cup kicks off. We have the toughest of starts in the Six Nations away to Ireland. They will be the favourites after all they have achieved, but it is an exciting prospect for us to go there and try and do a job on them in their own backyard. We will be ready.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d7a4d0a376dc987d3b98d98add880cefbd32bd2/0_115_4225_2535/master/4225.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7940659c341e7e26ed8bf2438fd61769","title":"australian open final naomi osaka petra kvitova australian open live","story":"Naomi Osaka claims successive grand slams, following her US Open triumph with a 7-6 (2), 5-7, 6-4 victory over Petra Kvitova in MelbourneAnd with that I shall say farewell.

Some match stats for you via the Australian Open as the players are ready for the presentationAnd here is a first-hit match report for your enjoyment!And that is that! No messing from Osaka whose service game was on point. Three Championship points were raised and although she spurned the first, going long with a forehand as Kvitova invited the rally, she wins it on the second with a big serve down the middle which the Czech paddles wide. She drops on her haunches but rises with a smile and a bow and she is a two-time Grand Slam winner and the first Japanese in history to win the Australian Open title! She was brilliant in that first set. Real nerve.Down 0-15 and with Osaka firing back a truly brilliant return, low and flat to her left-hand side, Kvitova was in real trouble but somehow she kept it in play and won the point. Osaka then flicks a couple of backhands long and then a big, bouncing first serve wins the game for the Czech. Can Osaka now get the job done? A perfect service game notable for Osaka winning a very close challenge, which would have been her final one, at 0-30. Kvitova was also wayward with a forehand volley at the net that she really should have finished. Anyway, 5-3 a familiar scoreline for Osaka ...Opportunity knocked for Osaka as she had three break points but let them slip. Kvitova initially couldn’t can’t get anything from her forehand leading to a succession of errors and a 0-40 hole. She saved the first break point with the widest of wide serves, the second as she goes down the middle and then a short rally results in a top-spinning forehand that zips down the court. And then an ace on the third! At deuce, she ripped down two big first serves. What a fightback. Osaka still a break up, mind. The difference between Osaka’s first and second serve is gargantuan. When the first finds its mark, Kvitova is scrambling to stay in the rally and it inevitably leads to a forehand winner by the Japanese. But when it doesn’t, her second is oh so vulnerable and just tees up the Kvitova backhand, earning a break point. But Osaka powers through three points to hold and she has a two-game cushion again. And win it she does! Kvitova has gone back to her wide serve which Osaka had so much joy in the midpoint in the match. That said, she’s made to work for it as a blistering forehand winner from the Japanese keeps her interested at 40-30 but an ace, her third of the match, does the business. This is impossible to call but Osaka has done exceptionally well to get back into this and she now has some daylight between her and her opponent. Her serve is looking dominant again and although there was a bungled drop shot at 40-15 (not her best work), she’s making the Czech work for every point. Kvitova now needs to dig in once again a must-win game, you feel.Osaka breaks! The Japanese takes the lead in the third set, in a game that ended a run of five without a “rally” of more than five shots and you sense that is where Osaka needs to go to win this match. At 30-30 Osaka showed signs of strain, missing a gimme groundstroke, blasting a backhand well wide from the centre of the court. But she gives it a “come on” as the game goes into deuce and then earns a break point on double fault. Following an eight-shot rally she then takes the game with a fine backhand winner. Much better from Osaka, she won a line call after Kvitova disputed her forehand winner and then polished off the game as the errors crept back into the Czech’s game. A rasping first serve to finish it off will do wonders for her confidence. That momentum then. Kvitova wins her fifth straight game, serving to love and looks calm and settled. Big game now for Osaka, she desperately needs to stem the flow.It’s easy to make this observation from the comfort of  Towers, and I am unfortunately no longer 21 years old nor have competed in a major tennis final, but Osaka is getting way too caught up in the moment here. At 0-15, she found the net as the ball struck the top of the cord and threatened to drop over only to fall the wrong side, she then shrieked and dropped to the court holding her head. Thereafter Kvitova breezed through the game, winning the set via a double fault. The momentum is all with her. From a position of dominance and near-victory, Osaka was struggling to find any sense of rhythm. One situation, of course, led to the other and down 0-30 she was unable to focus and looked sulky. But her anger and frustration was taken out on a couple of forehands and she reeled off three points to earn a break but Kvitova held at deuce, her first serve proving unreturnable. Three successive games won by the Czech. Impressive stuff. Kvitova breaks! Pressure, pressure, pressure. The first point sees Kvitova rip a first serve past the Japanese and then on the second she sort of half comes to the net, hesitates and then fires a nothing shot long. But she gets back to 15-30 only to undo it all with a double fault. Two break points for Kvitova, and the 21-year-old is all over the place, sending a groundstroke well wide of the mark and she slams the ball in her pocket into the court. What an opportunity missed. Serious mental strength from Kvitova, down three Championship points and on the ropes. Osaka raced into a 40-0 lead, and boy has she adapted her game well to the Kvitova serve. Kvitova fires down a forehand to save the first Championship point, Osaka is long on the second, again via a forehand from the Czech, and then on the third the Japanese hurries her return and fires it wide of her opponent’s shoulder. Brace stuff from Kvitova who wraps it up with two booming serves. Over to you, Naomi. Osaka breezed through that fairly untroubled. Her serve has notably improved in this set. Although Kvitova can still whip out an impressive return when she wants to and extends the game to 40-30 but the Japanese kneels to fire down a backhand into the corner, which leaves the Czech stretching and Osaka is one game away from glory ...The Kvitova serve was a little better, moving 30-0 up but then just as she addressed that part of her game, the unforced errors creep back. At 30-30, she’s a little lucky to win a point at the net, planting a shot straight at Osaka when she had most of the court to aim at. She then seals the game with a fine winner and celebrates on the baseline with a mixture of relief, elation and anger. Next game should be interesting. Kvitova had a glimmer of a chance there at 0-30 but her forehand fails her and Osaka draws level before two errors allow her to finish things off. That’s four games on the spin for the 21-year-old as Kvitova had out herself in a fine position in the set. Osaka breaks again! It’s fair to say she’s picking those rangy, wide serves of Kvitova now and moves 40-0 ahead with some smart returns, forcing errors. Three breaks down, she gets drawn into a rally and tries another of those loopy, sliced backhands but it’s well wide and drifts into the tramlines. Osaka is on the match. After the to and fro of the last game, that was a little calmer. Although, Osaka continues to send down some big ol’ winners. Osaka breaks back! She is now trying to force the issue on each point, trying for headline winners as opposed to just trying to stay in the points. The tactic gets her to 30-30 and, let’s be honest, if you have that in your locker, why not use it. Kvitova responds with a laser-accurate backhand winner which just kisses the line after Osaka challenges the call. At 40-30, a fine Osaka return – she gave it an almighty whack – forced Kvitova to go long. The Czech then inexplicably frames a regulation baseline forehand way, way wide but is saved the break when Osaka misses a backhand, her feet a little under the ball. Both players are very much finding their range now, an exchange of winners taking it into a fourth deuce. A rare Kvitova double fault gives Osaka a break and amid some very lame chants of, “let’s go Petra, let’s go”, she takes it as her opponent pings a backhand into the net. Kvitova breaks! A tale of two forehands. At 15-15 she flopped one straight into the net, looked annoyed with herself and genuinely a little downcast but then on the following two points she finds that very shot, a pair of impressive winners giving her a break point. Much better. But Osaka’s backhand is just as good to take it into deuce. But here comes that forehand ... what a turnaround! Kvitova wraps her body around it and powers the ball into the corner. Game on!A pretty remarkable statistic was just quoted by Jo Durie on the tele: Osaka is unbeaten in her last 58 matches when she’s won the first set. My word. Unforced errors so far – Osaka 10-18 Kvitova (10 of which are on the forehand). When you factor in Osaka starting to read the flow of Kvitova’s serve, this doesn’t bode well for the Czech. She’s comes through unscathed in that game, her impressive second serve resulting in Osaka finding the net but the warning signs are there.After a near flawless set of serving, Kvitova crumbles in the breaker! Osaka moved into an early 2-0 advantage, picking her spot with her best return of the match so far, watching the Kvitova serve and then flicking a backhand down the line. The Czech’s second serve opens her account but Osaka then moves three ahead with some smart serving of her own and moving in to dispatch a mishit return. At 4-1, she then thunders a brilliant forehand winner wide of the Czech, who didn’t have her feet in position. Kvitova maintains some interest via her serve but leading 5-2 and on serve, Osaka does the business courtesy of two unforced errors. Some gritty returning from Osaka and her movement around court remains superior. If she can just take the points beyond the first couple of shots and into rallies, you feel she can take control. However, the Kvitova first serve remains a potent weapon and a place of security for the Czech. But, you guessed it, a 10-shot rally presents Osaka with break and set point and on second serve, the Japanese stands in ready to crash in a return but Kvitova musters a brilliant serve down the centre and then responds with her own winner. A forehand error into the net gives her a second opportunity but, boom, here comes that Kvitova serve, which Osaka frames beyond the line. Two big shots then take us into a tiebreak. This is evenly, finely, delicately and any more adjectives you can think of, poised. Osaka mixing up her serve now, forcing her opponent wide and winning a couple of points. It looks comfortable for the Japanese but then an odd overhit drop shot tees up a winner for Kvitova. The point of the match is then won by the Czech who clips a drop shot winner after an exciting 18-shot rally, with nearly all the shots being cross-court forehands, and although it skimmed the top of the net was a fine piece of opportunism. At 40-30, though, Osaka sees it out. Given the tenor of the match, a tiebreak beckons. A lovely drop shot, leaning into the shot before finishing with a last minute slice puts Kvitova 30-15 up and then she powers through with big booming forehand after a serve down the middle and then another sliced drop shot from near the baseline. Nice variation from the Czech. Osaka still hasn’t got the rhythm of the Kvitova serve. Difficult to see where a break is coming from, barring a succession of errors. Rapid stuff from Osaka, and making a mockery of my previous comment about her serve starting to crack, to get within sight of the set. That game featured an ace and just five shots. Kvitova never had a sniff. First set: Osaka 4-4 *Kvitova (*denotes first server)There’s only 3cm in height difference between the two players but Kvitova is so much more rangy and her serve seems to come from a higher angle which Osaka is having problems reading. She’s standing well inside the baseline on second serve, which works on one occasion taking the game to an extra point as Kvitova threatened to serve to love. But the Czech’s delivery continues to be impressive and she finishes Osaka off on the following point. Osaka holds but her serve is showing signs of cracking as a double fault is followed by a weak second serve, which just plays right into Kvitova’s backhand return one of her key shots. Three break points follow. Osaka saves the first as Kvitova paddles a backhand long, the second is denied via a much better second serve and her opponent finding the net and at 30-40, Kvitova overcooks her return on second serve. At deuce, we see why Kvitova doesn’t fancy engaging in any rallying, Osaka simply ruthless with her groundstrokes, so much pace, power and accuracy. If there’s one story of the match so far it’s that Osaka wants to rally and Kvitova really doesn’t. She’s really taking the game to the Japanese on her first serve and she’s been proficient so far. But Osaka’s busyness on court keeps her in the game and she forces an unforced error to earn her first break. Kvitova isn’t having any of it, bangs down a winner and delivers a fist pump. That gives her the required jolt and a classy drop shot brings up advantage before a booming first serve sees Osaka sky her return. The first signs of pressure with Osaka down 0-30 as Kvitova ups her returning game. A 192kmh first serve helps alleviate some of that, and then the Czech can only parry the next serve way, way too long. That brings up a, “come on!” from the Japanese but Kvitova picks her angle with a full swinging backhand to bring up break point. However, she’s long after a small rally. Kvitova gets a second bite at advantage with Osaka’s second serve not really finding its range and merely setting her up for a big return. The 21-year-old denies her for a second time .. and it’s another “come on!”. Just as she looks ready to take the game, Kvitova telegraphs her move to the net and whips a winner past her left shoulder. But Osaka digs in, and closes out the game. Lots of positives to take from that, for both players. The opening point witnessed the first rally of the match (10 shots) and Osaka was the one dictating the pace and power before finishing at the net after a Kvitova sliced drop shot. Kvitova levels as the Japanese was a fraction long with a stooping forehand and then the Czech banged down three brilliants serves to take the game. When she finds the corner, Osaka is struggling to get much of a racquet on the ball.Andrew Benton emails in: “I do think Kvitova will edge it, but with two sets taken to tie break. Naomi Osaka will surely be there in many more Grand Slam finals!”Osaka now serves to love, showcasing her own prowess with some monster shots. Kvitova was nowhere near three of the four points. The players take a breather. That game featured a Kvitova ace on the second serve with Osaka standing a good foot inside the baseline. The angle of the left-handed serve was just too much for her, interesting to see how that progresses. Kvitova also ripped a low forehand winner and Osaka was long on return for the Czech to close out to love.A very nervy double fault wasn’t an ideal start for Osaka but she then replied with a 180km serve which Kvitova barely touched. A quick serve and volley at the net put her 30-15 up. However a long backhand at the baseline gave Kvitova a way back but the Czech is under early pressure with those Osaka groundstrokes, a piledriving forehand helping seal the game. Osaka to serve first ...Some interesting graphics via the WTAWhile we’re waiting and we’re all full of warm, fuzzy feels about the game of tennis, why not take a look at this ...The players are on court, warming up and we’re all good to go. Might as well throw in a prediction ... Osaka in three. I *will* be wrong. The players have never met before, and it’s interesting (and completely understandable) that Osaka was hitting with a left-hander yesterday. However, her record against leftys isn’t great. She’s only played four matches (Angelique Kerber twice, Michaela Buzarnescu and Bernarda Pera, all in 2018) and split them, losing her most recent in three sets against Kerber in Singapore. The players are out of the locker room and ready to walk on court ...Kvitova discusses reaching her first grand slam final in five years against the backdrop of what could, and maybe should, have been a career-ending injury ...Some tournament statistics courtesy of the excellent tennisabstract, which doesn’t tell us an awful lot in terms of finding a contrast but both have been serving well and maybe Osaka’s returning has been a little inconsistent.8 hours 51 mins Time on court 7 hours 5 minsReturning to the previous statistic regarding USAustralian Open doubles. Here is the full list in the Open eta (date is their Australian Open win)Each player’s respective route to the final makes for interesting reading as, quite clearly, Osaka has experienced the more arduous path, playing four seeds from the third round onwards. Ashleigh Barty has been Kvitova’s only elite opponent and the Czech is yet to drop a set, which has shown just how efficient she’s been in getting here. It may or may not prove key, and Osaka is seven years younger so probably not, but Kvitova has been on court one hour and 46 minutes less than Osaka that’s an entire match’s worth of tennis, and probably a bit more.For a more interesting, concise and better-written preview, then please take time to read Kevin Mitchell’s scene-setter from Melbourne ...Good morningafternoonevening wherever you are. Margeret Court, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Martina Hingis, Serena Williams, Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters quite the collection of players and a club Naomi Osaka is bidding to become a part of as she looks to win back-to-back grand slams with the US Open and Australian Open double.Only those eight women have done it before her – Graf and Williams a ridiculous three times – and she’ll be in bona fide legendary company if she can pull off the victory in Melbourne today and only intensify the school of thought that says she’s the next superstar of women’s tennis. It’s also been some rise for the Japanese, given this time last year she was No72 in the world.Standing in her path is another player who 12 months ago was on the fringes of elite tennis at No 29, albeit the reasons were drastically different to that of her 21-year-old opponent. This is Petra Kvitova’s first grand slam final since the knife attack at her home in 2016 which could have cost her her life and very nearly did her career, such was the extent of the injuries to her left hand. Her determination, consistency and all-round mental strength is battling back to top-10 level is probably more remarkable than her presence on Rod Laver Arena today. And although this will be her first slam final since 2014, her first outside of Wimbledon, her record in tournament deciders is a Graf-esque 24 out of 31. Slightly surprisingly, neither player has played each other before which, alone, should make for interesting viewing given the quality of tennis they’ve played over the last 13 days. Both are eminently likeable iniduals for a whole host of reasons and there’s no real favourite or underdog here – any sense of a hero v villain narrative is completely obsolete. The winner will not only get to lift the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup they’ll also become the new world No1.The players are due on court at 8.30am (GMT). Come join me. It should be fun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5c0d566c30668b13047008ba2f5506d14d82fd0/0_362_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc6d3288b612f5eb7285c6d6658008c4","title":"ethiopia holiday can change lives new tourism project","story":"A new tourism project in the northern Ethiopia highlands brings spectacular scenery and a warm welcome, where ‘your holiday can become the source of someone else’s dreams’We arrive at sunset. The guesthouse sits on a rising prow of rock with dizzying views of the vast gorge below. The altitude is around 3,000 metres, and after six hours’ walking, I am tired. Inside the thatched hut, two young women are tending a fire where the shiro, a kind of bean stew, is cooking. I glance out of the small window and a lammergeier, a bearded vulture, comes sailing past. Perhaps he, too, is drawn by the smell of food. This is a hungry land. My guide, Suleiman, comes in and we chat to the women, who seem very excited and happy.“Do you like your job?” I ask.They laugh even more, exchanging glances. “We have never earned money before,” says one of them, Daragut.“It’s true,” says Suleiman, “They will get 30 birr a day, about $1, for each visitor that comes. You are the first.” Hence the excitement.Daragut elaborates a little. “We will save up and open our own coffee shop.”I am in a tiny Ethiopian settlement called Khaled Abo in the Janamora district, an area bordering the Simien Mountains in the north of the country. Two days earlier, Suleiman and I had left the town of Gondar and been dropped off at the head of a footpath into the mountains. There we found a drover and donkey ready to take our luggage.The nature of the trek was soon revealed: five days through a landscape of fabulous mountain panoramas populated by people with not an ounce of spare flesh on them. Farms are mostly a quarter of a hectare – just over half an acre – of desperately over-grazed hillside terraces. When the rains allow it, they grow wheat and barley. Some have small flocks of sheep most have lots of children. None has electricity or running water. Bordering their land is the Simien Mountains national park, a major tourist attraction where visitors pay hundreds of dollars to be shown ibex, gelada monkeys and, with a bit of luck, a rare Ethiopian wolf. There is no evidence of that tourist money ever reaching these people.I am the first visitor on a tourism project that aims to address that, bringing money, employment and development to some of the communities around the park. Around 500 families have worked together to make a string of guesthouses, linking a superb route through their homeland. The sense of expectation and hope is palpable. For women like Daragut, the fantasy of owning a coffee shop has become a tangible ambition.I had my doubts about tourism in such a famished land, but from the start the welcome is overwhelming. On day one, a farmer invites us into his house, a simple hut partially plastered with cow dung and mud. The wind puffs dust through the cracks. One half of the main room is ided off for animals. There’s no furniture, just some sacks of grain to sit on. It’s United Nations food aid from Switzerland, says Suleiman: “They get 45kg of wheat every month.”These stick-thin people, I realise, are not only living on an actual cliff edge, they are permanently on the brink of disaster. One failed rainy season would finish them. I wonder if it’s right to be here.The farmer is adamant that it is. “We need visitors,” he tells me. “Not just for money, but to learn about the world.”Throughout the trek I hear this repeatedly. There’s an almost desperate urge among the people to be connected to the world, and to see some change.At Khaled Abo, I sleep well in the cold mountain air, rising at dawn to stand on the edge of this precipice. As the sun comes up, I distinctly hear a leopard cough directly below me. The curious thing about the landscape is that while every square inch of flat land is farmed, the vertiginous cliff is a wild wooded habitat for gelada, rare birds, hyenas, wolves and, as I discover, big cats. Simien is isolated from other mountain ranges and has evolved a unique flora and fauna.By day four I am in the swing of walking and Suleiman is coping well with his first-ever tourist, learning to point out things of interest. By day five, his attempts to teach me Amharic are even paying off. I can greet everyone and get the plurals and gender correct – handy at the wedding ceremonies we are invited to, or in the “honey beer” bars.This trip is certainly not for everyone: the simple food and lack of creature comforts are a challenge. The rewards are to see a region that few outsiders ever visit, to meet people isolated from the outside world, enjoy spectacular landscapes without modern infrastructure, light pollution and litter. The big reward, however, is to see your holiday become the source of someone else’s dreams.On my last day of walking, I fall in step with the donkey man, Adelalaw. We are on the escarpment again, on a path snaking along the edge of a steep precipice. I ask how much he earns in a year. “Last year, I sold one sheep for 600 birr and made 1,500 birr from selling beans.”That is about £70. For transporting my bag for the entire trek he is getting 800 birr: around five months’ money in less than a week. Money that is going directly into his pocket.“What do you think of tourists coming here?” I ask.“It is something good,” he laughs. “Something very, very good.”• The trip was provided by Tesfa Tours , whose six-night trek in Janamora Woreda for four people costs $560pp, including transfers from Gondar, food, accommodation, guide and pack animal, but not bottled drinks. The company recommends linking this trip with a few nights’ camping in the national park, a stay at Limalimo lodge and other extensions such as Lake Tana and Lalibela.The guesthouses and tour were set up with the assistance of Village Ways winner of the 2017 WTM responsible tourism award.

The words all mean “fly shame”, or the guilt that travellers experience when they fly off somewhere knowing they are contributing to climate change.So when scientists say that we must make “rapid, unprecedented change” to our lifestyles to avoid climate catastrophe, and pinpoint flying as the most destructive form of travel, the questions mount: Is there such a thing as a right to fly? Is self-sacrifice necessary? Can you fly with a conscience? Are “love miles” to see family or friends OK? Will inidual action make any difference to a global problem?People like me, cursed with loving travel but knowing that climate change is a death sentence for much of the world, have several choices. We can trust the aircraft manufacturers and governments to improve technology and legislate we can pay extra to offset emissions by investing in windfarms or other renewable energy projects or we can just fly less.The first option is useless. Planes are becoming more efficient, and biofuels and batteries may eventually reduce emissions significantly, but that is decades away and may be too late. A voluntary UN deal cobbled together by governments, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia), will launch in 2021 but has already been dismissed as weak.So that leaves it up to passengers, inidually and collectively, to act.Personal and corporate carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms – became popular 10 years ago but have been criticised as ways for the rich to carry on polluting. Companies offering them, however, say the idea is good and still growing and could go mainstream if it were made easier to include when buying tickets.“We are seeing rapidly growing interest in compensating flight emissions,” says Kai Landwehr of Swiss NGO Myclimate, which works with Lufthansa and Swissair. “It’s still a small proportion of flights but we are finding people are happy to pay more, even up to £40 a flight.”Others say they are applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where people cut back on their meat consumption drastically but not completely – to flying.“We were going away three or four times a year just because we always did,” says Sarah Jones, a marketing executive from Reading. “It was stupid. The climate thing was the last straw. We just thought, ‘this is crazy’, so now we go abroad a maximum of once a year and really look forward to it.”I personally feel intense flygskam, even vliegschaamte. My days of having both long- and short-haul passports, and reporting on climate change and ecological disasters from all corners of the world have ceased. I am now a self-styled “vleig-itarian”, committed to just one pleasure flight a year. Offsetting emissions may not be perfect, but it’s a good habit and it clearly helps people develop in better ways. Meanwhile, there are plenty of long-haul holidays that really do benefit local communities. Tourism projects that benefit communities are now thriving in Costa Rica, Ethiopia, South Africa, Bhutan and all over India and south-east Asia.A new trend is for people to pledge to give up flying for a fixed period of time. Two Swedish women, Maja Rosen and Lotta Hammar, have persuaded nearly 14,500 people to commit to going air-free in 2019, and a further 6,000 have said they are interested. Their initiative, Flygfritt (flight-free) 2019, hopes to get 100,000 pledges as a way of showing politicians what needs to be done.“Many people are concerned, but feel powerless. An air-free year can be a good way to break the habit and focus on alternatives,” says Hammar.Elsewhere, people are easing their consciences by persuading their peers to fly less and by trying to make their institutions more responsible. The US blog site Flyingless, aimed at frequent-flying academics, has a petition calling on universities and professional bodies to reduce their air travel. So far, 550 people have signed it and it is growing, says co-founder Parke Wilde, associate professor at Tufts university, Massachusetts.“Once people start to think about giving up flying, they have a momentary panic,” says Wilde. “They think their life will fall apart. But it doesn’t. I am not saying people should totally stop flying, but they could think about a radical reduction.”The idea of liberal institutions cutting back on air travel is also gaining ground. Danish daily newspaper Politiken has stopped its journalists taking domestic flights and is reducing their international flights to a bare minimum. Its travel section will, it says, now concentrate on destinations reachable by public transport. Media organisations in the UK and Ireland, for whom the European mainland is less accessible, would find this harder to follow.Many British groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the New Economics Foundation, are calling for a “frequent flyer” levy. This would aim to replace air passenger duty with a system that taxes people according to how often they fly. Everybody would be allowed one tax-free flight a year, and after that they would be taxed at increasing rates. So the first flight you took out to your villa in Spain might cost you nothing in tax, but your ninth trip would incur an extra £60.So far, though, the Treasury has shown no interest in the scheme, and aside from the six MPs who sponsored it as an early day motion in the House of Commons, only two more have signed up.Author and Nasa climate scientist Peter Kalmus sums up why he has quit flying: “With the world population approaching 8 billion, my reduction obviously can’t solve global warming. But by changing ourselves in more than merely incremental ways, I believe we contribute to opening social and political space for large-scale change. We tell a new story by changing how we live.”Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall Centre in Manchester, says: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one. I have been able to avoid flying for many years because what I do is not sufficiently important to justify the emissions.“If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise, we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit thinking through the pros and cons of flying engenders a very different attitude towards travel, time, emissions and moral responsibility.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58b8a5fda18edd693902d2cfa46b68b70180962d/0_5_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4df8b79bf8a43f898549f3f419c1ac6","title":"its doing what novels did 100 years ago how tv became a cultural force","story":"Eye-watering budgets, feverish commissioning, increased ambition and demand – now anything goes on TV. But will this golden age last?The world may be crashing down around our ears but, as we wait out the apocalypse, one thing is clear: we will not be short of good telly. Subscription services are booming, budgets have skyrocketed and, with more original shows on offer than ever, viewers need never leave the house again. While on-demand TV and box-set bingeing means we each create our own schedules, TV dramas have nonetheless yielded genuine “watercooler” moments, albeit with the chatter happening on social media rather than at work. Will Bodyguard’s PC Budd ever crack a smile? Is it possible for Luther to open a door instead of kicking it in? We need answers, preferably from strangers on the internet. So how on earth did we get here?“It’s the same story with TV as with everything else: the internet came along and provided access to more content,” says Piers Wenger, controller of BBC drama. “The age of digital platforms and on-demand content has led to a global market for English-language television. But it’s in the last five or six years that it’s really started to pop, which means massive amounts of money coming into the UK drama sector. And the audiences are vast.”The figures are indeed mind-boggling. In the final quarter of 2018, Netflix reached 139 million subscribers worldwide. Meanwhile, the BBC – David to Netflix’s Goliath in budgetary terms – has enjoyed startling success in the past year, with Bodyguard and Killing Eve reaching 43m requests each on iPlayer (Bodyguard also became the most-watched drama since 2006, with 17.1m people tuning into the series finale. In a peculiar turn of events, these marquee dramas have also been largely loved by the critics, which either means that critical standards have dropped or TV is getting better.Lisa McGee, writer of the Channel 4 comedy-drama Derry Girls, reckons it is the latter. “The scale of storytelling has broadened, as has its ambition,” she says. “I like to write for TV because I like spending a lot of time with characters you can do a lot in 20 hours. It’s doing what novels did 100 years ago. When I began writing 10 or 11 years ago, it was very different. Stories had to be episodic and have a theme. It was very formulaic. Now anything goes. No one’s afraid of the audience not understanding.”The writer David Nicholls, who adapted the addiction drama Patrick Melrose for Sky Atlantic, agrees: “There’s a wider range of tones and voices, and riskier shows are making it to the screen. With Patrick Melrose, no one ever said: ‘This is too tough for our audience’, or that he ought to be more likeable, or that we should take out the darker stuff. And that was great.”To understand TV’s current purple patch, McGee says, you have to go back 20 years to the arrival of HBO’s The Sopranos. It was, she says, a “game-changer, a show that assumed in its audience intelligence and sophistication”. More critically acclaimed HBO series followed including Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Wire and, later, Game of Thrones, along with hit shows from other networks – The West Wing, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Lost – all of which slotted comfortably into the 00s DVD box-set era and the growing appetite for binge-watching. If HBO showed what could be achieved through a succession of ambitious and generously funded shows, Netflix opened the floodgates through its consumer-friendly approach, upping the ante by allowing viewers to watch at their own pace and on whatever device they had to hand.Now, consumer demand has led to an era of feverish commissioning and eye-watering budgets across the networks. According to the Economist, Netflix splashed out $13bn on content in 2018, with the majority going on new commissions. While Wenger won’t be drawn on BBC drama’s financial outgoings, he says that budgets have increased sufficiently that “we can play in genres that we couldn’t have done justice to in the past”.All of which is great news for actors. “I’ve never been as busy as I am now,” says Daniel Mays, star of Line of Duty, Born to Kill and the forthcoming Sky One drama Temple. “Now you can really take the audience on a journey. Temple will be eight episodes at an hour long each. It gives us an incredible platform and the range to dig deep. Plus, the crossover among actors from film to TV is massive. When you’re working with actors of that calibre, it really raises your game.”Certainly, television is increasingly the place to be for Hollywood actors. In the era of “safe” cinema franchises, from Marvel and DC to Star Wars and Bourne, there is a sense that greater variety and experimentation can be found on TV. Older women in particular are finding meatier roles on the small screen: think Julia Roberts in Homecoming, Winona Ryder in Stranger Things and Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon in Big Little Lies. Nicholls has observed this blurring of the boundaries between TV and film. “As a writer, I no longer have to put on my TV hat,” he says. “I’m not suggesting there’s money to burn but there are things you can do now. You used to have to consciously limit your locations, or avoid scenes with large numbers of people, as these were tricky to implement. There was a kind of chamber quality to a lot of British TV, much of it wonderful, but now if you watch a prestige show like Peaky Blinders, it’s very cinematic.”While this increased ambition and scale is understandably seductive to writers and actors, what about the viewers? With a near-constant stream of new shows being flagged up, the choice can be overwhelming. And just because a show looks pretty and has set tongues wagging doesn’t mean it’s any good. “Starting something new definitely requires a level of commitment,” reflects Mays. “It can become this mountain to climb. We’re awash with content, so the worry is whether or not the production you’re working on can make an impact. It’s a fierce marketplace and the competition is stiff. Finding the audience seems to me to be the final hurdle.”Clearly there are greater challenges ahead. While Netflix continues to pile on subscribers, the rate of growth has started to slow a price increase was recently announced for US viewers. Meanwhile, Disney is soon to join the party with its own platform, Disney+ Apple’s streaming service is set to launch this year while Amazon Prime Video is proving a worthy adversary with series such as Transparent, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and an upcoming bank-busting Lord of the Rings series. If greater competition means more content, does more content mean quantity over quality? Mays thinks not. “I haven’t seen a dumbing down of anything – at least not yet. Looking at new projects, you have to think about who is writing it and who is going to be involved. But I see the rising competition as a positive thing. It’s good for actors but I think television as a whole has been enriched.”McGee certainly doesn’t see the on-demand bubble bursting just yet. “There’s always going to be a market for choice,” she says. In the face of that, audiences may continue to fragment but – as we found out with Bodyguard – it only takes Richard Madden taking his shirt off to bring them together again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2115dd86595307d99a818b8bcb1152534371abc4/0_173_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eb6448b8211a1e638482b5c0fd1ca2d","title":"lindsay lohan beach club","story":"The Hollywood star makes her comeback as ‘stern club owner’ in a reality show about hot people drinking from huge magnums of roséLindsay Lohan’s Beach Club (Wednesday 30 January, 10pm, MTV) is the weirdest, most addictive new reality show on TV. Just when you think you have seen every single permutation of “hot people in their early 20s have sex and fight on the beach” (Ex on the Beach, Love Island, Jersey Shore, Siesta Key, Laguna Beach) MTV goes and throws a proper celebrity into the mix.Lindsay Lohan – here, her voice one long sigh of realisation that she’s not going to win that Oscar any time soon – is running a beach club in Mykonos (or, as she pronounces it, “Meek-kane-os”) and she has flown a load of American “ambassadors” (bar workers) in to staff it. “I want the best of the best,” she says, before flipping a coin to decide who to hire.A group of modelsclub workers arrive and say things like: “I deal with celebrities all the time I’ve woken up in their beds!” and, “I’m nothing but trash!” and, “I just bring good vibes”. The job is somewhat confusing and has constantly shifting goalposts: when Classic Evil Bad Boy™ Brent mounts a drunk female client and shoves his tongue down her throat instead of acting as her waiter, he is praised as the MVP, but when Shy Girl™ May admits to feeling anxious she is given a stern talking to. “No crying!” says Lohan. “Only I get to cry, at home.” No LiLo, too real!Always talking about “the Lohan brand” (to be fair, she’s even made the theme tune her 2008 “hit” Bossy), Lohan is either the greatest actor alive, and this is her audition tape for her Hollywood comeback as “stern club owner”, or she genuinely believes this is a spotlight on her business ambitions and not just a reality show about hot people partying and drinking from huge magnums of rosé.Still, it’s a step up from her last reality show, the Oprah-produced apology tour that exposed Lohan as, in turns, a delusional a, a deeply sympathetic addict struggling to keep herself together, someone under huge financial pressure to fund her dysfunctional family’s lives, and also a huge hoarder. In scenes Lohan would probably rather forget, she threw tantrums (making her long-suffering assistant rush back to the hotel she was living in and move all her possessions to the room next door was a low point) was forced to sell designer clothes to a second-hand shop for money and at one point, disappeared off on a bender. So, actually, being very serious about running a beach bar in Greece sounds much more dignified.It’s easy to say that Lohan is just one in a line of cursed Disney stars but, er, is she? Ryan Gosling seems to be doing all right, Britney Spears pulled her career back from the edge, and the only thing Justin Timberlake cursed himself with was his Man of the Woods album. In light of Demi Lovato’s recent struggles, is there really any shame in making a weirdly watchable MTV reality show where you’re overly serious about teaching bottle-service waitresses life lessons like “meditate three times a day”, “treasure and value yourself”, and “call Oprah if you feel sad”? Welcome back, Lindsay! Mean Girls 3 would have been rubbish anyway. Probably."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/198b3a6990f3b7d2796eab5ffe0f22b63751caf7/0_71_5688_3413/master/5688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=142a9b79aaa4515a827ba601bbc6043a","title":"roger stone a master of the political dirty trick","story":"Beginning with Richard Nixon in the early 1970s, the former adviser for Donald Trump has made a career of ruthless campaigningThe raid happened before dawn, a Swat team of heavily-armed FBI agents in camouflage uniforms rushing between Florida palm trees to confront their target. The spectacle was laden with melodrama, surprisingly so given who had ordered it: Robert Mueller, the special counsel in the Russia investigation who has turned understatement into an art form.But for the man at the receiving end of the FBI swoop, the fireworks were entirely in keeping. Roger Stone, the political consultant indicted on seven counts on Friday in Mueller’s probe into Russia interference in the 2016 US election, is a connoisseur of political pyrotechnics.The 66-year-old was one of the “ratfuckers” who engaged in dirty tricks on behalf of Richard Nixon in the early 1970s, when he was still a teenager. From there he carved out a career in the dark arts of ruthless campaigning, working for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and latterly Donald Trump.His attachment to Nixon is enduring, literally so in the form of the disgraced former president’s grinning face tattooed on his back. As Stone emerged from a Fort Lauderdale courthouse following his indictment later on Friday, he alluded to his hero by making the same “V for victory” pose that Nixon adopted in 1974 as he boarded Marine One for the last time.“The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about,” Stone said on the steps of the Florida courthouse, as though dictating his own epitaph.There are flashes of that rapscallion Stone in Mueller’s 23-page indictment. The document quotes a text message sent by Stone to a person alleged to be his go-between with WikiLeaks during the 2016 election.In it, Stone circles back yet again to Nixon as he tries to persuade the intermediary to keep his mouth shut when facing investigators. “Stonewall it,” the text says. ‘Plead the fifth. Anything to save the plan … Richard Nixon.”In further attempts allegedly to lean on the inidual – dubbed “Person 2” in the indictment but presumed to be the radio host Randy Credico – Stone drew on a character from The Godfather: Part II. Do a “Frank Pentangeli” he exhorted, referring to the movie mobster who under duress retracts his testimony against mafia boss Michael Corleone in front of a congressional committee.The new charges concentrate on Stone’s alleged lies about his actions concerning WikiLeaks and its release of thousands of Democratic emails reportedly hacked by Russian agents during the 2016 election. Seasoned observers of Stone will be less than astonished by such accusations, given his relativist approach to right and wrong.As he told the  in 2017: “One man’s dirty trick is another man’s civic participation.”But Mueller goes much further. He presents a mass of detail alleging Stone was proactive both in seeking information about WikiLeaks’ hacked material and, crucially, in passing that information to senior figures within the Trump campaign.“Directed”: the word will send shivers down White House spines. Though the inidual who did the directing remains a mystery, speculation will inevitably veer towards the occupant of the Oval Office.Trump and Stone go back decades. Stone first urged the real estate developer to stand for president in the 1980s, was Trump’s main adviser when he toyed with running in 2000, and duly entered the presidential campaign when Trump took the leap in 2015.The pair are natural allies. Stone’s adoration of Nixon as a political strongman is shared by Trump. They both see themselves as outsiders are attracted to conspiracy theories – the “birther” lie that Barack Obama was born in Kenya was propagated by both and have a profoundly relaxed approach to veracity.Stone calls himself a “fervent supporter” of the president and “one of his oldest friends”. Trump, by contrast, sensing danger perhaps, has tried to put distance between them. In 2008 he told the New Yorker: “Roger is a stone-cold loser.” He went on to complain that Stone “always tries taking credit for things he never did”, inadvertently pointing towards another quality they have in common.Stone quit the Trump campaign in August 2015. Was he fired, did he walk? The reality was, true to form, opaque. But even after departing, as Mueller spells out, Stone kept in close touch with senior figures such as Steve Bannon.On the steps of the Fort Lauderdale courthouse following his indictment, Stone proclaimed himself “not guilty”. He declared: “I will not testify against the president”.As a statement of intent, it was entirely unambiguous. Donald Trump should be worried."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a67780ad959d2b8045309255258aa959e1c5a9c/0_175_4997_2998/master/4997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aac83cb2fb2e8d25de291200416e9b64","title":"end of shutdown federal workers debts credit shattered trust","story":"The blase attitude of Trump administration officials is a world away from the experience of federal employees – who fear a repeat in three weeks’ timeEven as he announced an end to the longest government shutdown in US history, Donald Trump warned that a new shutdown could begin in just three weeks “if we don’t get a fair deal from Congress”.That threat meant that clouds of uncertainty still remain in place for hundreds of thousands of government workers and unknown others whose lives were interrupted or derailed by a shutdown precipitated and prolonged by the president’s demand for a border wall, which he redoubled on Friday.From the National Park Service to Nasa, the Coast Guard to border patrol, the Internal Revenue Service to the Transportation Security Administration – federal agencies are now filled with workers with damaged credit ratings, missed mortgage payments, new debts and, especially, new doubts about their basic job security and the future.“I have the luxury that friends have loaned me one paycheck,” said Leisyka Parrott, 47, a furloughed employee with the Bureau of Land Management who is paying off a car loan. “The thing is when you get back pay, all the fees that you incur by missing payments – you don’t get paid back for those. If you are late for a payment and have a $25 fee, the government doesn’t pay for that.”Trump presented his announcement on Friday as a return to business as usual for federal employees. “I will make sure that all employees receive their back pay very quickly – or as soon as possible,” Trump said. “It’ll happen fast.”But even if the president makes good on his word, a quick return to normalcy was not likely for many federal employees, and especially for government contractors not entitled to back pay, union representatives warned.“There’s all kinds of issues with raising families, just buying gasoline,” said Franco DiCroce, a US army corps of engineers employee speaking in his capacity as president of Local 98 of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers. “Most of these people, their salaries are not skyrocketing. They’re suffering even more, because some of them live check-to-check, so if they don’t have money coming in, they’re going to have difficulty meeting their needs, to even buy groceries.”The number of federal employees filing for unemployment more than doubled in the second week of January to reach 25,000, up from 10,500 the week before, according to Labor Department figures. Last year the figure was 1,700.In announcing an end to the shutdown, Trump made only passing reference to the “recent hardship” workers had endured, and Trump claimed that federal employees did not want the shutdown to end.Then the president mentioned that the shutdown might come back as soon as 15 February, after temporary spending legislation runs out.“If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on February 15, again,” Trump said, or he would take unspecified action to ert funding for a wall, which could include declaring a national emergency at the border.﻿As pressure to end the shutdown grew to a crisis point over the last week, Trump administration figures began to dole out free advice to government employees about how to cover their domestic needs without the benefit of an income.Trump suggested that employees could arrange with grocers to shop for food on credit. The president’s daughter-in-law said, “It is a little bit of pain but it’s going to be for the future of our country.” The president’s top economic adviser called the shutdown a “glitch”.The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Washington, detected a trend. “This Marie Antoinette attitude of ‘let them eat cake’ is pervasive in the administration,” Pelosi said. “The president thinks, I guess, they can call their dads for money.”The billionaire commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, who collects Magrittes and in 2017 wore a pair of $600 velvet slippers customized with his department’s emblem to a Trump address to Congress, admitted on Thursday he did “not really quite understand why” federal employees have had to turn to food banks, recommending instead that they take out a bank loan against future income.“It’s obvious that he’s woefully out of touch,” said Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which has about 110,000 members.“He clearly does not understand the reality of being a middle-class worker in this country. First, people do not necessarily have access to the credit the way that he describes. And secondly with the shutdown, there are some very real logistical burdens in being able to access credit even if you would be able to under normal circumstances.”After calling the shutdown a “glitch”, the White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said employees working without pay were “volunteering”. Challenged on the term, given that employees who do not “volunteer” face losing their jobs, Kudlow said, “I’m not even going to go there. You know what I’m saying. It’s very clear …“They do it because of their love for the country, the office of the presidency, and, uh, presumably their allegiance to President Trump, but whatever: they’re doing it.”“I have no idea what this guy is talking about, and you can quote me,” said Erwin, the union president.“First, federal employees declare an oath to protect the constitution. They work for the American people. They absolutely do not work for any one person, regardless of who it is.“And about them being volunteers – these are not volunteers. This is compelled servitude. These people do not have a choice. They are absolutely being forced to work without pay indefinitely.”Parrott, the BLM employee, said the pause in the shutdown was “great news” but added, “at the end of three weeks, what will we do when we are back at the same place? Not allowed to work and no income. The lack of leadership is scary. I hope they find a path forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b6c801d58b86d979654a175ce6c7e8e6d8f667/0_61_4793_2875/master/4793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc03e11a4f33db60c0c5cfd5e0faa4c4","title":"greek mps ratify macedonia name change historic vote","story":"Majority back move amid angry cries of ‘traitors’ from nationalists who oppose dealGreek MPs have ratified a landmark accord allowing the country’s tiny northern neighbour Macedonia to change its name, in a momentous development for the stability of a region all too often riven by wars, nationalist populism and memories of blood-soaked mutual suspicion.After one of the most contentious votes in Greek history, Nikos Voutsis, the president of Athens’ 300-seat parliament, announced the result at 3.35pm local time (1335 GMT). In all, 153 MPs declared support for a deal that not only renames the strategic Balkan state North Macedonia, but ends an abstruse diplomatic dispute that has raged for almost 30 years.The result paves the way for the former Yugoslav republic to join Nato and eventually the EU – alliances hitherto blocked by Athens.Rushing to congratulate his Greek counterpart, Alexis Tsipras, the Macedonian prime minister, Zoran Zaev, tweeted: “Together with our peoples we reached a historical victory. Long Live the Prespa Agreement! For eternal peace and progress of the Balkans and in Europe.”Tsipras called it “a historic day for Greece that ends an issue that was a burden for our foreign policy”.The vote – two weeks after MPs in Skopje ratified the constitutional amendments needed to change their country’s nomenclature – followed five days of acrimonious debate in Greece, where nationalist sentiment had reached fever pitch.In and outside the parliament, opponents had deplored the pact as an act of unprecedented betrayal. Iron- and crowbar-wielding protesters attempted to storm the building during a demonstration that drew tens of thousands last week.Dimitris Orfanoudakis, a farmer who had travelled from Crete with his flag-draped teenage son, Giorgos, to join the protests, summed up the mood: “It is treason and it has to stop. We are the only people in the world who have to defend our borders from our own politicians because what they are doing is a national crime. Macedonia is one, and it is Greek.”No other state – with the exception of Austria after the first world war in 1919 – has been forced to change its name in modern times. For Macedonia, inhabited predominantly by Slavs but also ethnic Albanians, the dispute had become a matter of identity that, at times, bordered on existential crisis. For Greece, where most of the geographical area of Macedonia was incorporated after the Balkan war in 1912-13, sensitivity to issues of cultural heritage also run deep.When landlocked Macedonia declared independence with the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1991, Athens hit back, arguing that monopolisation of the name would unleash the genie of territorial ambition against Greek Macedonia, which includes the port city of Salonika. Fears had been fuelled by Skopje appropriating figures and symbols from ancient Greek history, including the erection of a gargantuan statue with an uncanny likeness to Alexander the Great – the most famous Macedonian of all – in the republic’s central square.“Greeks have vivid memories of Macedonia being fought over four times in the past century alone,” said Angelos Syrigos, a professor of law and foreign policy at Panteion University in Athens. “This agreement would have been a fair compromise if the new name applied to everything and by that I mean language, citizenship and nationality. Right now we have something in between. If our neighbours are known as ‘Macedonians’ who speak the ‘Macedonian’ language, that in the future could be the basis for territorial claims.”For Tsipras and Zaev, adding the geographical qualifier of “north” to the state’s new name was an honourable compromise that, once accepted, could normalise ties in the otherwise volatile western Balkans.Internationally, both leaders have been praised for their courage in defying nationalist sentiment on the ground. But what European officials see as “a unique and historic opportunity” to settle a dispute that has defied solution for decades, has tested the two politically.Responding to the vote, the main opposition leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, described the deal as a “national retreat” that marked “a difficult and distressing” day for the EU member state. Mitsotakis’s New Democracy party has a double-digit lead in polls ahead of general elections later this year. Far too many concessions had been made, he said, adding that once in government he would veto any hopes of Skopje joining the EU.Under the agreement Macedonia must notify the United Nations, where it is known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or Fyrom, before it officially changes its name – a monumental task that requires thousands of documents being changed both at home and abroad.On both sides there is recognition that the accord’s implementation will be far from simple. Committees have been created to help cement the friendship that has eluded the two nations for the past 27 years, including supervision of history teaching in schools.“A new chapter begins of building the confidence lost between the two but it is not going to be easy,” insisted Prof Dimitris Christopoulos, a political scientist at Panteion University. “State-to-state relations have poisoned people-to-people relations.”On the ground many agree. In a country that has become increasingly polarised as general elections loom, opponents are girding for battle.“We will take to the streets as they have done in France,” said Orfanoudakis, the Cretan farmer. “There’s going to be chaos. After eight years of financial crisis, of having foreigners pauperise us, they are not going to take our Macedonia away, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e76a820f8775fbb396a7fa95a9c18f211bdb86d/0_133_4037_2423/master/4037.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fc84e9b3e2aa2e14af0a292c70b0280","title":"thailands military junta cracks down on social media ahead of election","story":"Restrictions on political parties’ campaigning raises questions of how free and fair will much-postponed poll beSocial media campaigning will be heavily restricted in the upcoming Thai election, in a move political parties claim will gag freedom of expression and directly affect younger voters.Following the confirmation that Thailand’s much-postponed election would finally be held on 24 March – the first election since the military seized power in a bloodless coup in 2014 – the election commission released strict guidelines on political campaigning.The commission particularly targeted social media in the new rules, banning posts that contained anything other than candidates’ names, pictures and biographies, and the party name, logo policies and slogans. The rules were seen to target newer progressive parties that rely heavily on social media to spread their message.The new social media campaigning restrictions are an apparent extension of Thailand’s already draconian computer crimes law, where people can be arrested simply for sharing a piece of content deemed critical or damaging by the authorities, and which over the past five years has been used to stifle freedom of expression under the military regime.Parties have also been instructed not to “like” posts that violate any of these rules, spread “false information” or defame other candidates and parties in any way. All parties also have to register any social media channels with the election commission or face heavy fines and jail time. A special committee has also been set up by the election commission solely to monitor online campaigning and political discussion in the build-up to the election, leading many to question how free and fair campaigning will be.Future Forward is one of the new progressive political parties that claim to speak for the younger generation of Thais and use social media as a key part of their strategy for reaching out to voters. It has condemned the social media restrictions as “ambiguous and confusing”.Future Forward party spokeswoman Pannika Wanich said: “When speaking of the youth, this definitely affects their political engagement and awareness. Without a doubt social media has been the main platform for communication and access of information during this period.“These legal terms restrict not only freedom of expression but most importantly voters’ rights to information, which are the main principles of democracy in regard to conducting free and fair elections. The question is who actually benefits from these limitations? Definitely not the people.”Hours after the rules were announced, Sudarat Keyuraphan, head of election strategy for the Pheu Thai party and its possible candidate for prime minister, deactivated her Facebook account in an apparent move to avoid any violations. She was followed by several other political candidates.Chaturon Chaisang, an advisor in the Thai Raksa party, claimed the social media restrictions were a futile and outdated move by the election commission. “This is due to the fact the election commission does not understand the term ‘freedom’,” he said on his Facebook page. “But there’s no way they can block it. The social media world has gone far ahead. The election commission can’t catch up with it.”The announcement of the election rules has, for many, confirmed the fears that the military junta would try to retain strict control over the messaging of the election, and that even with the ban on political campaigning lifted, freedom of expression, particularly freedom to criticise the junta, would be limited.Last year the Computer Crimes Act was used to target Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, the leader of Future Forward. Police charged him with spreading “false” information about the ruling junta in a Facebook Live broadcast – charges he denied.In addition, the military has formed its own political party to run in the election and the new constitution heavily skews the parliamentary system in its favour, leading many to predict the election will do little to unseat the power of the military."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"UK has obligation to ensure peace process in North is protected, says Minister for StateVaradkar \u0026lsquohypocritical\u0026rsquo over reducing carbon footprint yet is flying Ministers across globeParamilitary organisations see opportunity in Brexit \u0026ndash the harder Brexit the betterEU aviation fuel tax mooted by France would penalise most heavily those who fly most\u0026lsquoEccentric\u0026rsquo Master of High Court has been relieved of debt cases\u0026lsquoFear and anxiety injected into women and families of Ireland again,\u0026rsquo support group saysWork stoppage seems set to take place on Wednesday after talks break downCampaigners in Waterford recruit local firms in effort to secure 247 cardiac serviceVaradkar insists it is the British who have the responsibility to compromise over backstopAll-island group says drinks manufacturers under pressure to plan for hard Irish BorderDerry man refused cash from fund as he introduced victims to scheme organiserEnergy body warns that building the farms would be impossible in a third of the countryNoel Rock\u0026rsquos Bill seeks to outlaw event ticket trading at prices above original face value\u0026lsquoThat could have been seven coffins\u0026rsquo: city workers on alert after courthouse car bombThoughts turn to backstop as device not principle and Border function as May lacks dealLeaflet sent to north Dublin residents seeking support for judicial review challengeNew \u0026lsquoClerys Quarter\u0026rsquo on O\u0026rsquoConnell Street to include 176-bedroom four-star hotelDSPCA calls on owners to microchip and vaccinate their dogsZuckerberg asserts control over isions in move which raises privacy questionsThe pair in their 70s died in the crash near the Monaghan and Armagh border"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3771112.1548454341!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour senator seeking support to oppose 164 home howth development","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe proposed 164-apartment development in Howth, north Co Dublin, which is opposed by Labour Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin. Picture: Crekav TradingThe development will comprise three apartment blocks, and is being built by Crekav Trading, part of the Marlet Group.Mr Ó Ríordáin recently sent a leaflet to local residents to organise support for a judicial review to overturn the decision to approve planning permission.The leaflet said it was “important to stress we are not against a housing development” on the site.“What we are determined to fight is an over-development which poses a potential threat to adjoining houses, and will result in the peninsula being choked by thousands of trucks carrying thousands of tonnes of material,” it said.The potential impact of the development could create a “substantial” risk of subsidence to neighbouring homes, the leaflet said.The site is located in Mr Ó Ríordáin’s Dublin Bay North constituency, where he narrowly lost his Dáil seat in the 2016 general election.Mr Ó Ríordáin and a local group of residents are looking to raise funds for the court challenge. The leaflet advertised a public meeting on the legal challenge for January 28th.The development will consist of 40 one-bed apartments, 97 two-bed units, 27 three-beds and six duplexes, according to planning permission documents.Mr Ó Ríordáin defended his decision to oppose the Howth housing development, stating he had “no problem” with the height or scale of the plans. “The problem is the impact of the development on nearby houses,” he said.The judicial review challenge would seek to claim the developer’s environmental impact assessment of the housing project was inadequate, Mr Ó Ríordáin said.“I don’t believe in handing the keys to the city to developers to do what they want on a given site,” he told The .The solution to the housing crisis needed to be “State-led”, he said.A spokesman for Marlet said it was “disappointing to see Labour being one of the biggest opponents of housing in this city at a time when homes are so badly needed”.The spokesman said the firm was “well used to Labour’s and Senator Ó Ríordáin’s objections to housing developments around north Dublin, giving different reasons each time”.Previously Mr Ó Ríordáin and residents in Raheny were successful in blocking the development of 500 homes, planned to be built on playing pitches beside St Anne’s Park. Crekav Trading were also the developer on that site, and the decision to grant planning permission was successfully challenged by judicial review."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017.

Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

It released images of trenches and what it said was ISIL paraphernalia.Mohagher Iqbal, the MILF\u0027s top peace negotiator, said on TV on Thursday that he hoped radical splinters of the separatist group, like those of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), would recognise the will of the people for peace.One of the BIFF leaders has already reached out, he said, without elaborating.Populist coalition under fire after Italy\u0026#39s answer to Benny Hill appointed to Unesco commissionComment: Crime will continue to rise until us bobbies are released from the shackles of the PC policeThousands march for abolition of Australia\u0026#39s \u0026#39Invasion Day\u0026#39Golf prescribed by the NHS, after pilot studies find it boosts happiness, fitness and strength Comment: The Queen is right: we need commonAustralia Day 2019: Why the British sent convicts Down Under - and how they named the countryComment: Chris Packham\u0026#39s plan to \u0026#39re-wild\u0026#39 Britain shows how little he understands the countrysideComment: Why does John Bercow have to be so toe-curlingly annoying?Comment: There’s a new version of Project Fear... and it suits Brexiteers just fineScottish gamekeepers accuse wildlife groups of using bird of prey satellite tags as a \u0026#39political weapon\u0026#39Debbie McGee has surgery to treat breast cancerBrazil dam collapse leaves at least seven dead and 200 missingSpeedboat killer Jack Shepherd to remain in Georgian jail as lawyers consider fighting extraditionDonald Trump reopens US government after longest shutdown in history hits 35th dayRescuers find body of Spanish toddler trapped in wellRoger Stone: Dirty tricks, a Nixon tattoo, and a lurking presence in shadows of Trump\u0026#39s worldFormer Trump adviser Roger Stone charged with witness tampering as part of Mueller probeSir Philip Green’s lawyers ordered to reduce hourly rate of almost £700 in injunction battle Energy bills could rise by £100 a year after price cap is revised We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/11/11/brexit-greater-london-3.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6801121  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= West Croydon  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/11/11/brexit-greater-london-3.jpg","title":"brexit no deal stockpiling companies cash reserves uk finance data","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

A common way to cover up the messy process of (de)construction. The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceThe figures follow research from Lloyds Bank which showed that UK firms ramped up stockpiling in the final quarter of last year. The bank said the increase in stockpiling efforts was caused by the threat of shortages and disruption posed by Brexit. UK Finance also released data on household lending and spending in 2018. Credit card spending rose to £11bn in December, up 8.8 per cent on the same month in 2017.Eric Leenders, the trade group’s managing director for personal finance, said this rise in spending was “largely offset by increased cardholder repayments, with almost half of cards not bearing any interest at all”. “This reflects the growing trend of consumers using credit cards as a preferred payment method rather than as a means of borrowing, in order to take advantage of additional protections and value-added benefits,” he added. UK firms ramp up stockpiling over Brexit disruption fears, survey saysAirline meals being stockpiled as travel industry braces for BrexitManufacturers stepped up stockpiling in December, survey revealsNo more space to stockpile food \u0027as Amazon may have booked it up\u0027I\u0027m not worried we\u0027re stockpiling Brexit food – if anything, I\u0027m gladMeanwhile, while mortgage lending rose 4.7 per cent in December to £21.1bn, the number of mortgages approved that month was down 2.4 per cent compared with one year earlier. “We know from the experience before the 2016 referendum, however, that political uncertainty can have a big impact on lending,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He also warned that “the recovery in mortgage approvals once Brexit uncertainty has faded likely will be lacklustre”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The lender’s international trade index shows that export growth fell to its weakest level in almost three years in the fourth quarter of 2018. Exports of consumer goods held up well, Lloyds said, but the transport sector was hit by changing emissions regulations and new rules about diesel vehicles.

Ford warns no-deal Brexit would cost it $800m this year, report says Jaguar Land Rover to halt production for a week due to BrexitAirbus believes in Britain – we should listen to its CEO on BrexitNo-deal Brexit would be ‘betrayal’ of what was promised, says HammondMeanwhile, the data showed that UK manufacturers had increased stockpiling efforts over recent months due to the threat of shortages and disruption posed by Brexit. The UK Manufacturing PMI Index for purchases of stocks jumped up to 53.7 for the month of December, from 51.1 in the previous month. Gwynne Master, managing director and global head of trade for Lloyds Bank Global Transaction Banking, said: “We should be mindful of the impact of fluctuating trading conditions and global and domestic political uncertainty on the UK’s exporters.“Against this backdrop of challenging conditions, it’s encouraging to see international demand for UK consumer goods sustain the longest period of manufacturing export order growth since the financial crash, even if the pace of growth has weakened.”She said the findings highlighted how important it is for companies to deal with a erse range of markets. “Exporting to a mixture of different countries would help, for example, a business offset the impact of a Chinese downturn if they were also exposed to the Netherlands, Ireland or Spain, which are all showing real strength,” she said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This flow of new money into financial markets had the effect of re-inflating asset prices, which had collapsed during the financial crisis, and increasing liquidity in order to get banks lending again.\u0026nbspThe problem was that rather than using this new money to lend productively, banks predominantly stuck to the easy-profit route of bidding up property prices. In an ultra-low interest rate environment financial firms have also engaged in ever-riskier lending in the pursuit of higher yields. The result is reinflated asset bubbles and collateralised loan obligations to over-indebted companies, which echo the subprime lending behind the last crisis.QE also had dramatic implications for inequality. All of this new money flooding into financial markets pushed up asset prices, meaning a big payoff for their wealthy owners. The Bank of England, which has created £445bn through QE, estimates that its policies made the top 10 per cent\u0026nbspof households wealthier by £350,000 each. Meanwhile, the asset-poor were left with little more than the fairytale of trickle down economics.The billionaires of Davos are a painful symptom of inequalityThe rise of ‘pauper’s funerals’ is a sad reminder of UK inequalityBoE should wind down its balance sheet early, says Ian McCaffertyGeorge Osborne says the Bank of England\u0027s QE makes the rich richerAll this is not to say that central bankers should have kept their hands clean. Central banks were forced to ramp up monetary policy as politicians shied away from their responsibilities to manage the economy with appropriate fiscal policy, instead opting to counter-intuitively cut for growth\u0026nbspthrough austerity. With central bankers limited by time and by mandate, the first round of QE can be seen as a ‘necessary evil’ - doing nothing would have only deepened the recession.But there should be no such excuses when the next downturn arrives. Further attempts to stimulate the economy through QE-fuelled asset price inflation will have diminishing returns, only creating more bubbles and further widening inequality.A sustainable recovery will only come from policies which stimulate demand in the real economy. This is something which QE could be redesigned for.Central banks’ power to create new money, as demonstrated by QE, is a powerful tool that must be put to much better uses.\u0026nbspThis is an idea which has been put on the table in the UK. In the US rising Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and in France Nicolas Hulot, who resigned from Macron’s government, are also displaying the bold thinking required with their calls for a Green New Deal a massive programme of spending on green jobs and infrastructure, which could be financed by central bank money creation.But Green New Deals and other alternatives to QE will be most effective if there is an element of coordination between countries. Firstly, on a technical level, for any country other than the United States, creating vast sums of new money while foreign central banks keep a tight monetary policy could lead to unwanted pressure on their currency.But perhaps more importantly, the problems facing humanity, from climate change to spectacular inequality, are not limited to one country and cannot be solved by one country alone.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Deposits held by UK non-financial companies grew by 3.5 per cent in the year to December 2018, with the wholesale and retail, transport, electricity, and gas and water sectors all recording higher annual growth. Stephen Pegge, managing director, commercial finance at UK Finance, said the figures suggested “firms are preparing for uncertain trading conditions by building up their cash reserves”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe data also showed that lending to manufacturing grew by 8.4 per cent in the year to December, compared with a 0.3 per cent drop among UK businesses overall. “This may in part be driven by manufacturing businesses stockbuilding in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty,” Mr Pegge said.Created with Sketch.

The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceThe figures follow research from Lloyds Bank which showed that UK firms ramped up stockpiling in the final quarter of last year. The bank said the increase in stockpiling efforts was caused by the threat of shortages and disruption posed by Brexit. UK Finance also released data on household lending and spending in 2018. Credit card spending rose to £11bn in December, up 8.8 per cent on the same month in 2017.Eric Leenders, the trade group’s managing director for personal finance, said this rise in spending was “largely offset by increased cardholder repayments, with almost half of cards not bearing any interest at all”. “This reflects the growing trend of consumers using credit cards as a preferred payment method rather than as a means of borrowing, in order to take advantage of additional protections and value-added benefits,” he added.

He also warned that “the recovery in mortgage approvals once Brexit uncertainty has faded likely will be lacklustre”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The lender’s international trade index shows that export growth fell to its weakest level in almost three years in the fourth quarter of 2018. Exports of consumer goods held up well, Lloyds said, but the transport sector was hit by changing emissions regulations and new rules about diesel vehicles.

The UK Manufacturing PMI Index for purchases of stocks jumped up to 53.7 for the month of December, from 51.1 in the previous month. Gwynne Master, managing director and global head of trade for Lloyds Bank Global Transaction Banking, said: “We should be mindful of the impact of fluctuating trading conditions and global and domestic political uncertainty on the UK’s exporters.“Against this backdrop of challenging conditions, it’s encouraging to see international demand for UK consumer goods sustain the longest period of manufacturing export order growth since the financial crash, even if the pace of growth has weakened.”She said the findings highlighted how important it is for companies to deal with a erse range of markets. “Exporting to a mixture of different countries would help, for example, a business offset the impact of a Chinese downturn if they were also exposed to the Netherlands, Ireland or Spain, which are all showing real strength,” she said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Currently WhatsApp users are not required to provide their name or any other identifying information beyond their phone number to use the messaging app.Merging with Facebook Messenger and Instagram could force WhatsApp users to reveal information about themselves that they would prefer to keep private.Data privacy expert Tim Mackey, who works at the software firm Synopsys, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat Facebook should take considerable care in how the integration ws handled given the firm\u0027s spotty history with user privacy.Merging personal information and privacy configurations from three significant applications won’t be trivial, he said. Facebook development teams would do well to look at this precedent and prioritise user privacy.With the integration project currently expected to take a year to complete, and with end-to-end encryption as part of the plan, we should expect the Facebook engineering teams to focus attention on uniform data security both in their platform and in the apps themselves.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In Settings, hit the Privacy tab. From here, you can control who gets to see your future posts and friends list. Choose from Public, Friends, Only Me and Custom in the dropdown menu.Annoyingly, changing this has no effect on who’s able to see your past Facebook posts. Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps. The list might be longer than you expected it to be. It’s worth tidying this up to ensure things you no longer use lose access to your personal information. 89 Change your ad preferencesYou can view a list of everything Facebook thinks you’re into and tinker with your ad preferences by going to Settings and Adverts. A lot more information is displayed on the desktop site than the app, so we’d recommend doing this on a computer.99 Download your dataFacebook lets you download all of the data it has on you, including the posts you’ve shared, your messages and photos, ads you’ve clicked on and even the IP addresses that are logged when you log in or out of the site.

That hasn\u0027t ever been possible before.At the moment, the three are entirely separate. Though they are all developed by the same company, and so share some data between themselves and work together, they are in practise three different apps that can\u0027t talk to each other.But this state of affairs has been gradually changing, even before this news. WhatsApp years ago started sharing data with Facebook, and the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram have left the company in recent months amid suggestions they were concerned about their apps being subsumed into the parent company.Mark Zuckerberg hopes the decision will make each of the apps more useful, according to the original\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreport. That in turn should make people engage with them more – and potentially encourage them to stop using rivals, like Apple\u0027s iMessage.“We want to build the best messaging experiences we can and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private, a Facebook spokesperon said.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work.”In short, Facebook believes the combined infrastructure will make the apps better, and therefore more likely to be used that, in turn, will help generate more of the data and advertising opportunities that Facebook relies on to make its money. But there might be other less obvious reasons to bring the three together, as well.Until now, the apps have been kept separate, and so the data they each collect has been partly compartmentalised too.People have also been able to share different data with the companies themselves. WhatsApp only requires a phone number for people to use it, allowing them to stay relatively anonymous if they wish on Facebook, people have to use their real name and are asked to give over far more personal information.Many people choose to share more on WhatsApp or even entirely forego Facebook, because the latter has always had a more lax approach to people\u0027s personal data. WhatsApp has repeatedly stressed how important it is safeguard people\u0027s privacy – but that was largely led by its founders, who have left the company, and is thought to be getting eroded as it is subsumed by Facebook.\u0026nbspIn short, the move could be a concern for anyone who prefers to keep their data separate – and away from Facebook. The sense of having some contacts, information or messages safe on WhatsApp and away from its owner, or vice versa, will be lost.It\u0027s possible that same data will be used for advertising, and there have already been rumours about WhatsApp using information for marketing or showing ads within the app itself. No final decision on how the integrated services will be monetised has been decided yet, the\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreported.Regulators are likely to share those concerns, and it\u0027s almost certain there will be yet more questions about whether Facebook should be more restrained than it is now.Facebook is still in the early stages of the work, according to the reports. But the plan is set to be finished by the end of this year or the beginning of 2020.As with most Facebook projects, the rollout will probably be small at the beginning and gradually take place across users. It\u0027s likely that such a major update will be made available to a small number of beta testers initially before being added in stages.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anger over poor social conditions grew so intense that it provoked a riot in the late 1990s. A local social activist who objected to youths smashing bottles on the road and handed a bin bag full of broken glass to the mother of one of those responsible\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbsphe had bricks thrown at his house and firecrackers pushed through the letterbox.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisWhat turned Thanington round was substantial aid from the European Union.Paul Todd, a former resident who works on housing and homelessness issues, says:\u0026nbsp“About 20 years ago it was regenerated when it got a large dose of money out of the European regeneration budget.” The funding was used to make extensive renovations such as putting new roofs on the council houses and renewing bathrooms and bedrooms so the homes of council tenants looked better than those privately owned. In addition, the\u0026nbspregeneration money funded a community centre, known locally as the Resource Centre, which provides space for sports and recreation, as well as accommodation for children doing homework which they could not do at home.Paula Spencer, who has managed the centre since it was built, adds that the EU “spent £2.5m in doing up the estate and getting rid of the rat-runs. It used to be that they would nick your video machine and disappear down an alleyway.” Crime and antisocial behaviour dropped by 50 per cent as the regeneration measures took effect. As a newly arrived council tenant, Heggie says that she had been worried by the crossbow bolt incident but “apart from one broken car window on my driveway I have had no trouble since”.Created with Sketch.

Nevertheless, residents and outside observers agree that Thanington retains a strong sense of communal solidarity.“It’s largely retained its village identity,” says Todd, whose relatives still live there and who has great affection for its people. “Everyone knows everyone else’s business.”\u0026nbspOver the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant. Then there was the shootingThe only state institution to help preserve this small and vulnerable community was the EU, so it is worth asking why so many of those living in Thanington voted Leave\u0026nbspin the 2016 referendum. At first glance, their actions, repeated in many deprived areas receiving EU funds in England and Wales, appear to be an inexplicable example of social and economic self-harm. Nevertheless, it was probably the high Leave\u0026nbspvotes in deprived white housing estates which tipped the balance towards Britain voting for Brexit. So it is important to discover why people from such places voted as they did in such overwhelming numbers. Was it a vote very much determined by opposition to immigration, or was it a more general protest by the “left-behinds”\u0026nbspand the “left-outs”? \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMost people in Thanington voted for Britain to leave the EU, and they did so because they are poor and feel neglected, according to Todd, who has known the area for 30 years. He says that there is an “assumption there that immigration has affected their prospects. I don’t think people are aware of how much Thanington did benefit from the EU. The European regeneration money certainly made a huge impact on the quality of the housing stock up there. It probably gave some of the houses another chance, otherwise they might have been knocked down. Some people want immigration cut and others think that talk of another referendum is an indicator that their concerns haven’t been taken seriously.”Bellas did not mention and may not have known about the EU regeneration effort which happened before he started living on the estate after years of homelessness and holding insecure jobs. In any case, the impact of that funding is running out and there are signs of growing decrepitude and insecurity.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite a deprived area,” he says. “There’s a lot of people with drug problems and\u0026nbspalcohol issues, and they seem to be moving families in who have already been evicted from homes because of antisocial behaviour. Everyone’s got a right to live anywhere but it doesn’t do great things for the estate.“Over the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant – ‘you’re going to sell this for us’\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa lot of guys in Mercedes,\u0026nbspreal high-end saloons,\u0026nbspwho don’t fit on the estate. Then there was the shooting in the summer, which was a direct result of these guys coming down from London and that happened just around the corner from us.”Created with Sketch.

Our kids don’t play out on the street. I know all my neighbours and I know all their kids, but it’s really difficult because there are people from off the estate come to sell their drugs that I don’t know. We had a heroin dealer set up in the house next door to us and for about six weeks, we had people knocking on our door coming to pick up their drugs up and it took 50 phone calls to the police to get them to sort it out.”The shooting Bellas refers to took place on 19 July last year when\u0026nbsptwo men in balaclavas shot and seriously wounded Danny Mobey in Thanington’s Godwin Road.Bellas voted Leave in the referendum, denying that this had anything to do with immigration and saying that his decision was more to do with democracy and resistance to power being devolved to a centralised European government and unelected officials making decisions on his behalf. He says: “I just feel that there is something quite sinister and secret about a federal government.”About the economic consequences of departure from the EU, he is optimistic, arguing that the Germans, French and Spanish will want to go on selling goods to Britain. He says that a lot of people he knows had voted Leave influenced by “the Brexiteers’ promise that there would be £350m\u0026nbspextra for the NHS”.\u0026nbspHis two biggest concerns are the lack of policing and the decline of the NHS, where his wife works as a nurse, and which he fears the government wants to privatise.Even in a place as small as Thanington, perceptions of violence vary markedly from street to street and person to person. Di Hutchinson agrees that things are getting worse: “I was ill last Christmas and I saw a drug deal going down and I was shocked because it was the first time I’d ever seen it.” Overall, however, residents and outside observers say that Thanington is no worse than other housing estates and other areas of deprivation anywhere in UK. (There are more affluent parts of the district away from the estate.)People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhereFinancial aid from the EU and other advantages stemming from membership had little effect on poor Leave voters in 2016. Either the EU’s achievements were under-publicised, or – and this is probably the crucial factor – whatever the EU did was not enough to counterbalance a pervasive sense among millions of voters that their lives are getting more pressured and insecure. This was as true in east Kent as it was in Cornwall, an example of ingratitude for EU largesse often cited. That county has a population of 530,000 and received €654m\u0026nbsp(£574m) from the EU between 2007 and 2013. It was due to receive another €600m before 2020, yet 54.5 per cent voted Leave.Fear of immigration was probably the most important factor in the way people voted, but so too was the privatisation and outsourcing of utitlities and services, job insecurity, decline in real wages, high rents, deindustrialisation and a lack of cheap transport. The EU and its supporters can justly complain that Brussels is being unfairly scapegoated for failings that it has\u0026nbspnothing to do with, and which\u0026nbspshould be blamed rather on globalisation, privatisation and the austerity policies pursued by Conservative governments.Yet, even if the EU is not responsible, this does not mean that the deep discontent\u0026nbsprevealed by the referendum result is\u0026nbspnot real. Simply put, Brexit is a symptom as well as a cause of the crisis which has enveloped Britain and envenomed its politics. The ill-considered Remain slogan of 2016 – “Better Together” –\u0026nbspwas never going to resonate with those whose standard of living had stagnated or deteriorated over the past decade despite Britain being in the EU. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAusterity may have driven homelessness rise, minister admitsTransport is already scarce: according to Spencer, it takes two bus trips to get to the nearest doctor, while there is only one bus every two hours in the evening. A planned new exit from the A2, which is being contested by local residents, will make Thanington even more isolated from the rest of Canterbury than it is at present. And as houses become more expensive and cost far more than the present population on their low-paying jobs can afford, the traditional community will break up as parents find that their children have to move off the estate if they want find anywhere cheap enough to live.Even more seriously, the insecure low-paid work done by many in Thanington does not provide enough to pay rent and food. The result is reliance on food banks and free school meals. Caroline Heggie says that people are becoming more and more indebted “because now you’ve got companies giving out credit cards to people with low credit ratings”.A telling sign of the growing deprivation in Thanington – and the sort of event which may explain why people there failed to endorse the status quo in 2016 – is a recent plague of rats.“People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhere,” says Spencer. The origin of the rat infestation is unclear: it may be that rats were disturbed by the new housing construction in nearby fields, or that the council no longer deals with rubbish that has been left to pile up. Cuts in public services of all kinds have hit Thanington hard, and services dropped include pest control.A rat catcher charges £60, which tenants must now pay themselves though there may be 10 or 12 rats to be disposed of, necessitating more than one visit.\u0026nbspHeggie says: “You used to have council ‘rat people’, but because of austerity, you don’t have them anymore.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is why a stodgy literary biopic like The Life of Emile Zola somehow won the main award at the 1937 Oscars. It’s a solid and worthy piece of work, with a grandstanding performance from Paul Muni (under a lot of whiskers) as the campaigning French novelist. The idea, though, that it is one of the “few truly great pictures of all time”, as its own publicity suggested, is clearly idiotic.It may seem churlish to go after an underdog like Rocky but this was an undeserving Best Picture winner. The Academy voters in 1976 acted as if they were punch drunk and had spent too long in the ring with Apollo Creed. The problem with its victory wasn’t so much the film itself but with the other nominees that were spurned in its favour. Taxi Driver, All the President’s Men and Network all surely had a better claim to that year’s statuette.310 8. Around the World in 80 DaysThis was a perfectly amiable big-budget travelogue but you can’t help but suspect its Best Picture Oscar was more to do with the marketing and hustling skills of its producer, Mike Todd, than with any brilliance in the filmmaking. It was directed by the Englishman Michael Anderson, previously best known for The Dam Busters, and featured David Niven as the intrepid traveller, Phileas Fogg, who bets he can travel all the way round the world in a little over two months.Paul Haggis’s Crash is a decent and well-meaning study of the consequences of racism and violence in contemporary LA. It was independently made and had a large ensemble cast, all giving heartfelt performances. However, Robert Altman had covered similar territory better in Short Cuts and the feeling persisted that it had won the Best Picture award because some Academy voters were determined not to give the Oscar to the gay-themed contemporary western Brokeback Mountain.You rarely win an Oscar without a strong marketing campaign. The now disgraced distributorproducer Harvey Weinstein knew the secrets of getting Academy voters on his side better than anyone else in the business. Whether it was the Blitz-like approach to advertising in the trade press, or the timing of the awards screenings, or the way he kept the film’s stars in front of the media or his relentless courtship of the Academy members, he was arguably as important to the Oscar success of the so-so musical Chicago as any of the creative talent behind it.It’s not bad. It’s a love story that touches on mental illness and mathematics (neither usually subjects that Hollywood embraces). Russell Crowe gives a fine performance as John Nash, the Nobel prize-winning boffin with the beautiful but unstable mind. Nonetheless, Ron Howard’s biopic isn’t any kind of classic. It won its Best Picture Oscar in an unusually thin year.Marty, the 1955 winner, isn’t even the best version of its own subject matter. This story, scripted by the great Paddy Chayevsky, about an emotionally repressed Italian American butcher from the Bronx looking for love, had already been made as a live TV drama the year before. In the small-screen version, Rod Steiger gave a superlative performance in the lead role. Ernest Borgnine in the film version can’t help but seem like second best to anyone who saw Steiger in the same part. Whereas the puggish Borgnine makes Marty a figure of pity, Steiger turned him into a full blown tragic hero.810 3. Out of AfricaYou’ll remember the pink flamingos and all those scenes of beautiful Kenyan landscapes that looked as if they were cribbed from a David Attenborough natural history documentary. You won’t ever forget Meryl Streep’s eccentric accent as the Danish baroness and author, Karen Blixen (“I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong hills”). This is mushy stuff, though, and hardly deserving of its Oscar.This rousing, Scottish-set (but partly Irish-filmed) medieval epic is famous for its scenes of William Wallace’s army in blue faces lifting their kilts and baring their bums. Regardless of how accurate this was as history, it played into ongoing debates about devolution and Scottish independence. The film also did its bit for the Scottish tourism business. Mel Gibson knows how to stage a battle scene. Whether that qualifies his film for a Best Picture Oscar is another matter.1010 1. The Greatest Show on EarthFrom a vantage point 67 years on, the decision to give the Best Picture Oscar to Cecil B DeMille’s circus epic in 1952 is truly baffling. British viewers who have seen it will almost certainly have done so on TV (where its 152-minute running time made it useful for filling in gaps in the schedule). It has a decent cast and some reasonable stunts but Academy voters were surely clowning around when they chose it over other nominees in the same year which have aged far, far better like High Noon and The Quiet Man.110 10.

It has a decent cast and some reasonable stunts but Academy voters were surely clowning around when they chose it over other nominees in the same year which have aged far, far better like High Noon and The Quiet Man.It’s currently looking unlikely, although there have been instances where the Academy president has decided to revoke nominations after they were announced. However, these have all been due to rule-breaking technicalities that rendered them ineligible for the award they were nominated for.The first time this ever happened was at the first ever Oscars ceremony in 1928. The voting board didn’t want Charlie Chaplin – who was nominated four times for The Circus – to sweep the board so stripped him of them all and gave him an Honorary Award instead.Another instance of a rescinded nomination arrived In 1954 when John Wayne film\u0026nbspHondo\u0026nbspwas nominated for Best Story. It was\u0026nbspdisqualified after the Academy\u0026nbspdiscovered that the script was based on a short story called The Gift of Cochise.Director of controversial James Bulger film apologises to familyIn 2010, a 25-minute Norwegian short film titled Tuba Atlantic had its nomination for Best Live Action Short Film revoked after it was discovered it had aired on television before its theatrical releasAnother film whose Oscar nomination came under fire was short film Detainment, which depicts the\u0026nbspmurder of two-year-old James Bulger after he was abducted from a shopping centre by Robert Thompson and Jon Venables when they were 10.Bulger’s mother, Denise Fergus, called upon Irish director Vincent Lambe to remove his film from contention – something he has since said he won’t do.Singer was fired from Bohemian Rhapsody after failing to turn up to set.

Perhaps, but it would be unwise to read too much into it.Markets\u0026nbspmight simply be wrong about the likely outcome.\u0026nbspWe often talk about markets as if they are definable, tangible entities but in reality they are huge numbers of companies, investors, traders and brokers buying and selling to each other.\u0026nbspThe price of the pound is an aggregation of millions of transactions between those participants. More sellers and the price will go down, more buyers it will go up simple supply and demand.While many of these participants have a significant financial interest in correctly predicting the movement of currency values, they frequently get things wrong.Banks spend vast sums applying statistical models and researching down to the tiniest detail in order to get an edge in currency markets.But that doesn’t necessarily mean they have any special information that allows them to predict the outcome of a political process that, it is fair to say, has been less than smooth.The report on the DUP that has helped boost the pound wasn’t special insider knowledge obtained only by financial institutions it was printed in The Sun.The Brexit referendum itself is a clear example of currency markets being a poor predictor of a political event. The pound suffered its biggest single-day plunge ever on 24 June precisely because most market participants thought the UK would vote to remain.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former engineers Derek Mack (left) and Mike Kelloway, both from the Isle of Wight, inside the remains of the Black Arrow projectile, the UK\u0027s only rocket to successfully launch a satellite into orbit, are unveiled at a storage facility in Penicuik, near Edinburgh, after almost 50 years languishing in the Australian OutbackFormer Scottish first minister Alex Salmond makes a statement outside Edinburgh Sheriff Court after he was arrested and charged by police.

The work has been attributed to BanksyIf they had predicted it correctly, the decline in sterling would have taken place before the vote\u0026nbspand not have been so painfully sudden.The 2016 vote was a simple binary choice on which there had been reams and reams of polling. The current political situation is anything but. It has many potential outcomes, none of which seem to be truly understood, even by some of the MPs arguing for them.On balance, have we benefited from being in the EU?The second reason not to set too much stall by\u0026nbspthe currency market as a political sage is that there are a host of other factors beyond politics that affect exchange rates.\u0026nbspInterest rates are the most obvious and closely correlated. A higher return on holding the pound pushes up demand and therefore the price.Which leads to a related point: currencies are always priced in pairs. Pound v dollar, euro v ruble etc.So if demand for the other currency in that pair increases, the pound will suffer a relative decline.On Friday, the pound rose 0.7 per cent against the dollar but fell slightly against the euro. Events in Europe had strengthened the single currency, events that had nothing to do with the Brexit saga.\u0026nbspWhile it would be nice to have a handy index illuminating the road ahead, the value of the pound is only of marginal use in this regard.In other words, when it comes to Brexit, it’s still anybody’s guess.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

However, in the end his hip injury just took too much out of him, and Bautista Agut clinched a breath-taking 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (4-7), 2-6 victory to reach the second round where he\u0027ll face Australia\u0027s John MillmanBritish Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

But then nothing happens – she’s just left in limbo.“She relies on medication for her mental health. Where she lives now she’s got quite a lot of support.

backing a new Brexit referendum, who will launch a drive to rewrite his proposals for the next phase of withdrawal.The move from three MPs to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a Final Say referendum, once again thrusts the party’s deep Brexit isions into the spotlight.Hours earlier four other Labour MPs had joined Tory counterparts at a press conference, with one accusing Mr Corbyn of “standing in the way” of a people’s vote.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhile Mr Corbyn’s office declined to comment on Thursday, the leader’s social media outriders launched a counter-attack on the Labour rebels whom they accused of dishonesty.Meanwhile doubt has emerged over the viability of a cross-party push by MPs to delay the UK’s withdrawal in order to avoid leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March.No-deal Brexit would be ‘betrayal’ of what was promised, says HammondAnd in Davos, chancellor Philip Hammond warned that a no-deal Brexit – something Theresa May has refused to rule out – would be a “betrayal” of the 2016 referendum result, underlining the split\u0026nbspat the heart of the Conservative cabinet.On Tuesday Ms May will give a statement and table a motion setting out the next steps of her Brexit plan, but because of previous measures approved in the Commons, all MPs will also be able to table amendments containing proposals for what they think the government should do next.Mr Corbyn has already submitted the Labour Party’s amendment, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign for a fresh referendum because it failed to fully commit the party to backing one.It would require ministers\u0026nbspto find time for MPs\u0026nbsponly to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.But The Independent understands three Labour MPs – Ian Murray, Angela Smith and Mike Gapes – have now taken the unusual step of tabling amendments to their own party leader’s amendment, in a bid to remould Mr Corbyn’s approach so it backs a new vote immediately.Mr Murray’s would commit the government to holding a referendum offering a choice between a Brexit deal that guarantees “full participation in the single market”, as previously promised by Labour, and remaining in the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote:

to try and secure a new referendum, with more than 1.1 million people having signed the petition.While neither Mr Corbyn’s amendment, nor the three amendments to it, stand much chance of being passed in\u0026nbspthe Commons, the joint push from Labour MPs speaks to a growing frustration on the party’s backbenchers over the ambiguity of the leader’s position as the Brexit clock ticks down to 29 March.At an event on the steps of parliament earlier in the day Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Is Brexit causing hundreds of companies to leave the UK?Ford warns no-deal Brexit would cost it $800m this year, report says Jeremy Corbyn, help give the

supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Chuka Umunna, who was also at the event, argued that party politics should take a back seat, saying: “The choice is stark and there is no way of escaping from it or postponing making a decision because we are out of time – do you want to facilitate some form of Brexit or give people the power to stop it?”\u0026nbspMeanwhile,\u0026nbspChris Leslie told The Independent: “There really isn’t any excuse now for Labour not fulfilling the conference promise for a people’s vote. An election hasn’t been triggered, so we should be at that stage now.”Polling indicates Labour voters and members are in favour of a new vote, but the leadership has had to walk a fine line with many constituencies in heartland areas having heavily backed Brexit.A separate group of Labour MPs strongly oppose a new referendum, including frontbencher Melanie Onn, who wrote to her constituents saying she would quit her role in Mr Corbyn’s top team if the leadership did back a new vote.Following the event in the morning Corbyn-backing commentator Paul Mason said the intervention was “daft”, and accused the Labour rebels of “preparing a doomed centrist party”.Columnist Owen Jones argued that a second referendum amendment would not get through because Labour MPs in Leave seats and Tory MPs would oppose it.He added, addressing Mr Umunna on Twitter: “You either don’t know the facts or you’re being dishonest. Which is it?”The amendment that seems most likely to get thorough the Commons on Tuesday is that written by Labour’s Yvette Cooper, with cross-party backing, that seeks to extend Article 50, delaying Brexit to avoid a no-deal scenario.But concerns have emerged that legislation it requires to enact its aim\u0026nbspcould get bogged down and even blocked outright in the House of Lords.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I believe that is where collective responsibility should lie.“So number one, the legal default is we leave the EU on March 29 without a deal unless there is a deal is in place.“That hasn’t changed. That is the prime minister’s view and that’s my view.”Proposals likely to be put to a vote on Tuesday include one that would extend Article 50 and one to give parliament power over the commons schedule instead of the executive, while another aiming for a second referendum was dropped due to a lack of support.There appeared to be hope for Ms May to receive backing from rebels and her DUP partners in government under an amendment tabled by Sir Graham Brady, that would approve the deal she has negotiated with Brussels as long as the Irish backstop was replaced.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If she had said behind in one poll, that would have beendferent matter.”A BBC spokesman said last night: “We have received Labour’s latest communication and will respond to them.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A new political party, which represents what a lot of us want.Because you’ve got to say — the parties in Westminster aren’t doing that, are they Whatever happens at the end of this awful Brexit mess, one thing is clear, our politics have to change.The isions between our current parties no longer reflect the isions in the country. If Brexit has told us anything, it’s told us that.And there is a growing anger out there that the views of millions and millions of people are simply not represented in Parliament.That’s obvious from Brexit — more than a third of Labour voters wanted us to leave. Including a majority in some northern constituencies. Almost two thirds of Tory voters wanted us to leave.Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip, has already said he fancies creating a new party. A Brexit Party.Good luck to the man — I might even join it, because I have the horrible feeling our Parliament is going to betray the people, and we’ll end up staying in. That would be a travesty of democracy.The very reasons which convinced more than million of us to vote for Brexit were the same as those which are causing isions across Europe. And as a result we’ve seen the huge rise of populist parties. In Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Greece, France and even Germany. Oh — and, of course — the USA.These parties are sometimes right wing, sometimes left wing. In Italy there is an alliance between the two.What they are all, though, is dferent to the politics we have now. They are parties which listen to the people. Populist is just another way of saying popular, really.Most agree on a whole bunch of issues. We need to control immigration, number one. Especially immigration from Islamic countries.We need a bit more respect for the nation state: People feel proud of the countries in which they live. Yes, even some Belgians.A lot are socially conservative. By which I mean they do not have much time for gender neutral toilets, LGBTQI protests, political correctness and so on.Instead, they have a respect for traditional values. For the family, for the Christian faith, on which our countries were founded. For our histories. And they are sceptical of the European Union.But they also recognise that there are deep economic isions within our countries which need to be addressed. In our own country a terrible chasm between the affluence and influence of London, versus the rest of the country. Between rich and poor.We have no political party right now which covers those bases.But that is where the real ide in society lies. So, as January drags on — how about a party  One that represents US Labour MP Diane Abbott thinks that the BBC Question Time programme discriminated against her because she is:a blackAbbott got a rough ride and the audience spent most of the time laughing at her or booing.Diane, listen. It’s not your skin colour. It’s not your gender.It’s something  altogether.We are used to politicians speaking down to us.And we are used to politicians being thick.But when both occur at the same time, that’s when the rest of us decide we’ve had enough.Stuff the BBC won’t tell you.Number One – The International Monetary Fund has admitted it got its projections wrong.The UK economy is not stagnating. Economic growth for the next year will be every bit as strong as in France and Germany.And meanwhile all the other indicators – investment, employment, growth in wages – are MUCH better than those in the European Union.Someone tell Huw Edwards.Yet again I’ve accepted a Facebook friend request from a woman without checkingshe’s a proper woman, rather than a porno sock-puppet.Sure enough, within the minute, I was invited to view intimate photographs of the lady.And she ended her invitation with the words: “Slap my frog, cowboy!”Why would I want to slap her frog  I hope her frog has a long and happy le. And why am I a cowboyTheres nothing funnier than slebs making idiots of themselves while politically grandstanding.Gary Lineker, for example, does it every week. His intellect is about as radiant as a candle flame in an aircraft hangar. But he still gives it large, ranting about Brexit. And praising Europe’s worst leader, France’s Emmanuel Macron.The latest slebs to fall foul are the Spice Girls. They posed for photos in “edgy”T-shirts reading: Gender Justice. Now it’s been revealed those shirts were made in a workshop by women who are paid p per hour.There’s gender justice for you.The memorial to Bomber Command in London’s Hyde Park has been defaced by scumbags.They threw paint over the sculpture – and also vandalised statues of Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Our pilots in World War Two won a battle against all the odds to protect this country from fascism. More than , of them died doing so.The filth who vandalised the memorial know nothing of that. Nothing of personal sacrice, of hardship, of discipline.And they know nothing of history, full stop.What kind of people are we raising in this country So, huge congratulations to Ant McPartlin.The perpetually smirking Geordie munchkin won “best presenter” at the National Television Awards, despite not having been on television for a year.People have criticised the decision, but I’m all in favour.Andhe promises to stay off the screens for another  months, I’d give him next year’s award, tooDid you see the shots of the babes turning up for the National Television Awards I call them babes because it was minus ten or something out there.

At least one of them needs to pass.If one does get the support of a majority of MPs, then Theresa May can go back to Brussels and say, look, this is what will get the deal through my parliament.It will strengthen her negotiating hand, make the EU engage and give her a chance of securing some changes.As one secretary of state says: “She needs to demonstrate she can carry something through.”No insiders tell me that May will only go back to Brussels “when we have a very clear set of proposals”. Butnone of these amendments can muster a majority, then the EU will just sit tight.It knows this parliament is fiercely opposed to No Deal and so isn’t concerned that the UK will actually go down that route.Instead, the EU will wait, confident that the UK will request either an extension to the Brexit process or a softening of it.So far, there are a iety of amendments down. One from the shop steward of backbench Tory MPs, Graham Brady, says the Commons will support the withdrawal agreementthe backstop is replaced by “alternative arrangements” to prevent a hard border in Ireland.Another from the Tory chairman of the Northern Ireland Select Committee, Andrew ­Murrison, seeks to time-limit the backstop. Influential cabinet ministers have also been pushing for the Government to put down its own amendment.They are confident that they are winning that argument and one will go down before Tuesday — though some in Number  still prefer to put their faith in the Murrison amendment.The signicance of a Government amendment would be that Speaker John Bercow would have no choice but to call it. One indispensable minister involved in these discussions tells me: “A Government amendment could well be a more objective exit mechanism which would allow us to ­demonstrate that this is not going to be permanent.”The outline of this amendment has, I understand, been discussed with the DUP and ministers believe that the “likelihood” is that they will support it. But one cautions that “what may seem a given one day can suddenly unravel”.No won’t be drawn on whether a Government amendment will be tabled or not. But leading cabinet ministers are confident it will be. One says: “This is the best chance of moving everyone forward together.”One option being discussed is for a series of clear tests which,met, would allow the UK to exit the backstop. The aim is to make it clear that the EU couldn’t keep the UK — or Northern Ireland — in the backstop forever.There is also, I understand, “a parallel conversation” going on about what the EU will accept in terms of changes to the backstop. If a Government-backed amendment passed the Common it would also, in the words of one source, give the Government “half a chance of stopping Cooper-Boles”.The amendment from Labour’s Yvette ­Cooper and former Tory minister Nick Boles would require the Government to ask for an extension to Article  to avoid No Dealthe UK and the EU can’t come to an agreement.As this source points out: “Cooper-Boles does best when people think there isn’t an alternative.” There is no guarantee that a Government amendment will carry the day.“To pull this off, you need the ERGto come in behind it — and that’s quite a big ask,” says one of those intimately involved in these discussions.This source warns that “emotionally a lot of them will find it very dficult”. But these Brexiteer MPs need to realise thatnothing passes on Tuesday, then parliamentary efforts to extend Article  will gather more support.Brexit itself will be in danger and this country will end up with a super soft Andrex Brexit — or no Brexit at all.MPs should not do anything to suggest that they want to take No Deal off the table. This week, the EU and the Irish government have been all over the place about what No Deal would mean for the Irish border.The contradiction at the heart of the backstop is beginning to become apparent. It is, the EU and ­Ireland say, necessary to prevent a hard border. Butthe backstop results in there being No Deal, then it will lead to precisely what it is meant to avoid: A hard border.As this inconsistency becomes more and more obvious, there is more chance of member states pressing the EU to move on this issue.One minister who has been talking to his ­counterparts across the EU in the last few days tells me: “They’re ­definitely budging.”So, this would be precisely the wrong moment for MPs to undermine May’s negotiating position by talking about taking No Deal off the table. As one of those close to the PM puts it: “This has been a dficult week for the EU. Don’t make it easy for them.”This is one of the reasons why MPs MUST REJECT the Yvette Cooper amendment. At the moment, this amendment looks like it will probably pass. But given how many Labour MPs in leave-voting seats have qualms about it, this is far from certain.Tory MPs, let alone ministers, shouldn’t help it through as doing so would pull the rug from under the UK’s negotiating position.VENEZUELA is a sorry tale of where state socialism leads. In an oil-rich country, people are starving. It is embarrassing, and shaming, that Jeremy Corbyn’s ideological blinders mean that he can’t see what is happening there.Labour talk about opposing “outside interference” in Venezuela even as a slew of democracies in the region recognise the head of the national assembly, Juan Guaido, as the legitimate president.Labour’s opposition to outside interference puts them in the same position as Russia, China, Turkey, Bolivia and Cuba. This is the company we’d be keepingCorbyn became Prime Minister.AT Cabinet this week, Theresa May told ministers that to get the deal through she would have to go to the Commons and “present a changed backstop”.This is signicant because it is her recognising that she needs substantive – not just cosmetic – changes to the backstopshe is to get her deal through.TALK of an early election just won’t go away at Westminster. It is not that the Tories want one, but that there is a sense that the Commons is so deadlocked on Brexit that it might end up as the only option.One possible route to an election is that Yvette Cooper’s plan to extend Article  passes the Commons, a deal is then eventually agreed but can only pass with the rider that there is a second referendum. I understand that, in these circumstances, the Government would rather go for an early election.One senior Cabinet Minister says that Theresa May’s “reddest of red lines is we have to leave the EU”. A ­referendum with Remain on the ballot paper would threaten that.“Political parties ought to make sure they are ready to fight an ­election”, a member of the Tory party board tells me as he explains why they are rapidly stepping up candidate selection and the like. But I am told that “no one is planning an election”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Taxes will rise. We’ll even run out of Mars bars.But across the Atlantic, something has been ­happening that should give us all some perspective.Over the past decade, Venezuela has plunged into the abyss — but there’s been no civil war, no earthquakes or hurricanes.Just a brutal, corrupt government that has turned what was once Latin America’s richest country into a hellhole.Starvation rations plunged millions into hunger and ­malnutrition, with some resorting to eating dogs, cats, even zoo animals.People got into kne fights over the right to scavenge from a dumpster.Its economy is more than three times smaller than in . Inflation climbed into the thousands, then millions of per cent.The result has been a refugee crisis on the scale of the Syria conflict.No wonder tens of ­thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Caracas this week, declaring national assembly head Juan Guaido the legitimate president.All this is awful for the poor bloody Venezuelans.But what does it have to do with Britain The answer is that Venezuela wasn’t just a ­disaster. It was an experiment — cheered on by Jeremy Corbyn and his cronies.In , Hugo Chavez took over Venezuela.He ruled until his death in , when he was succeeded by his hand-picked protege Nicolas Maduro.Chavez modelled himself on Latin American ­revolutionaries like Fidel Castro and Simon Boli. He nationalised much of the oil industry — which dominates the ­Venezuelan economy — and imposed punitive taxes on foreign firms.He introduced price controls and later currency controls. He declared “economic war” on the “stateless ­bourgeoisie” and seized the goods of private companies he denounced as saboteurs.For Corbyn, the Chavez regime was an inspiration — a chance to see true socialism brought to le.Venezuela, Corbyn has said, “showed us that there is a dferent, and a better, way of doing things. It’s called socialism”.It wasn’t just Corbyn. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott and Corbyn’s media chief Seumas Milne have all praised the ­Venezuelan revolution.That “better way of doing things” has ruined tens of millions of lives but there has not been a hint of an apology from Corbyn.Normally, the fact that people are taking to the streets to free themselves of a vicious regime would be cheered to the rafters by the Left.Instead, there is the silence of those who find themselves ­hideously embarrassed.The few who are not ­staring at their shoes claim that Venezuela has been the ­victim of an American plot.That Maduro took, in McDonnell’s words, a “wrong turn” from Chavez’s true socialism.That it was all down to a falling oil price.Yes, Maduro took a wrong turn. But that turn was to follow the path laid out by Chavez.From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, there is a long and shabby history of British left-wingers acclaiming a workers’ paradise — only to declare, once its ­failure is clear, that it wasn’t really socialist after all.Never mind the millions of lives ruined — let’s have another go!If he became Prime ­Minister, Corbyn might not succeed in turning Britain into Venezuela.

That’s why I am calling for common sense. If Theresa May hasn’t got a plan by the end of February, Parliament should be able to vote on whether to extend Article  for a few months to try to get a proper, workable deal in place. The cross-party bill I’ve put forward does not block Brexit, revoke article  or overturn the referendum result, nor should it.   It just allows Parliament to decidewe need more time to avoid No Deal. It’s unpopular to say everyone might need more time, especially when it’s because the Prime Minister has made such a mess of things.

While there is no antidote for a child suffering from a toxic overdose, doctors provided supportive care until the substance works its way out of the body naturally.

Staff morale is low because we are frightened to say anything in case we implicate ourselves and lose our jobs.   Staff and pupils at both schools have been warned not to drink from the taps and the replacement of hundreds of metres of pipework is now under way. The teachers asked to remain anonymous in the December letter because they fear reprisals from council bosses for speaking out. The teachers added: We have been warned by senior management within North Lanarkshire Council that we are not allowed to discuss the water issue with anyone or we would be putting the council into disrepute, which is a sackable offence. And, secondly, we would risk being removed from the teaching register.  The teachers claim that a request to be supplied with bottled water was turned down. They also accuse the council of testing the water but refusing to disclose the results. MacGregor said the letter raised serious questions. He added: Clearly, there’s an issue here and the first priority is ensuring that no pupils or staff at the schools are put at risk. What is entirely unacceptable is the apparent lack of transparency from Labour-led North Lanarkshire Council. While nobody wants to induce panic, nobody should be shutting down legitimate questions. Gagging teachers from speaking out or stopping them getting answers is completely unacceptable. They have a right to be heardthey have questions over their health and safety and that of their pupils.  Figures obtained by the Daily Record show the average number of sick days taken per secondary teacher in North Lanarkshire is about eight. The figure in Buchanan High is almost . Consumption of high levels of copper can cause poisoning and stomach upsets. MacGregor added: Given what we know, this does beg further serious investigation by the council. Certainly,there is any suggestion that staff are becoming unwell because of unsafe drinking water, then urgent action is required. A spokesman for North Lanarkshire Council defended the councils handling of the problem. This copper solution is caused due to corrosion in the pipework – this has minimal impact on the quality of the water but can appear alarming, he said. We have replaced filters, are flushing the system twice a day and we are in the process of replacing all the copper pipework with plastic pipes. Several parents of pupils attending the shared campus said they were aware of the issues with the water. The grandfather of one pupil said: It is worrying but, from what I’ve been told, the school are advising the pupils not to drink the tap water and are supplying drinking water. The mum of another pupil added: We have been told about it. I think most children nowadays only drink bottled water. But it’s essential that clean drinkable water should be available.

All these shops used to be stunning, so it’s sad now every other shop is a charity shop, said Dorothy Day, .   “There should be more independent shops - I don’t like to hear people are buying from charity shops, because what’s going to happen to the high street then ” Solihull Borough Council offers charity shops an % discount on business rates.

A bridge worker had spotted the empty pushchair and reported it to police. When officers checked CCTV they saw harrowing images of a woman pushing the buggy and then falling into the water.Humber Rescue teams were dispatched, along with a helicopter, reports the Hull Daily Mail .Miraculously, the mother and daughter were spotted by bridge staff and thrown a lebelt, which they clung to until they were rescued. Both had survived their terrying ordeal and were pulled from the water, an estimated  minutes after they fell from the bridge. In a controversial move, police decided to charge the woman with the attempted murder of her daughter after she recovered. They were taken to Hull Royal Infirmary by helicopter, where the toddler was treated for hypothermia and the effects of swallowing water. Rescuers said it was a chance in a million that they fell on a still evening with no tide movement.   It later transpired the woman had written ‘cause of death’ and then her husband’s name in indelible ink. The mum, who suffered a fractured spine, was discharged from hospital two months later. But that was not the end of the remarkable and tragic story. Police and prosecutors defended the decision to charge her and said they were correct to prosecute and hoped it would serve as a warning to other people. A Humberside Police detective admitted that the June  case was one of the more dficult his career and that the decision to prosecute had weighed heavily on the conscience of investigators. He said: “We had to balance many considerations during this investigation. “The woman was in a desperate state, but she went to the Humber Bridge knowing what she was going to do. “People have to be aware that whatever mental state they are in they are accountable for their actions. “I hope this serves as a warning to other people. Help is available and people should seek it.” More details of the case came out during the court hearing, in which the mum pleaded guilty to the charge of attempted murder. The woman admitted she had set out with the intention of killing herself, but could not recall what led her to take her daughter, who was three days from her third birthday.   Judge Michael Mettyear, the Recorder of Hull, said he could not accept her actions were not premeditated and that only a custodial sentence could be justied. This is one of the most dficult cases I have ever had to deal with, he said. It is dficult because on the one hand you are an intelligent woman, you have no previous convictions and you pleaded guilty at the very first opportunity. On the other hand your conduct was very likely to kill your child. Of the  people who jumped off the bridge I was told that  died. It was a remarkable piece of luck that you and she survived unscathed. The court heard she had reached the depths of despair after the break-up of her marriage. She met her husband when she was seven months pregnant with her daughter. She was deeply religious and believed the deaths would lead to an afterle where she could be with her daughter in a place where they could be happy together.The court heard that after struggling to cope with losing custody of her daughter , the mum became increasingly concerned for the girls welfare.In a letter she had written: I had no hope of receiving help from the court or where. I do believe in the afterle. Solving the problems of this world seemed no longer possible. This is how I came to seek our safety in another world. I did not do this to get rid of my child or to hurt my husband or anybody . When I was in the water and my daughter was screaming, scared and cold it was me who felt the most pain. My child was now suffering more than before. Im forever grateful for those who saved my little princess. In seeing my child so poorly and so scared I knew that I had made everything worse. Dads sick ultimatum to daughter: Help me murder your mum or I’ll kill myself A psychiatrist said the mum was suffering from a depressive disorder as a result of her lack of contact with the child. The woman ended up being jailed for  months in a case Judge Mettyear described as “one of the most dficult of his career”. The woman appealed the sentence and Court of Appeal judge Lord Phillips said he wanted to show the woman “mercy” as he agreed for her to be released from prison after just three months. Lord Phillips said of Judge Mettyear: “This experienced judge found this tragic case presented a most dficult problem. The fact he granted permission to appeal showed he had reservations. “We have to ask ourselves, was this a case that required a custodial sentence and ... was it really necessary to sentence this unhappy woman to prison, to punish her for the momentary aberration that led her to try to take her and her daughter’s le  “We say momentary, because she immediately regretted it. There is one word you will not read in the sentencing guidelines, and that word is mercy. “There are occasions when the courts can put guidelines to one side and apply mercy instead. “We have reached the conclusion that this is one such case and we quash the sentence of imprisonment imposed.” Whatever youre going through, you can call the Samaritans free at any time, from any phone on  .

The boss of Sports Direct , , snapped up stricken House of Fraser and Evans Cycles late last year, staged a boardroom coup at struggling Debenhams, owns stakes in a host of well-known names and is in the running to buy music chain HMV.But the tracksuit tycoon’s journey to the business big league began in a small shop opposite a pub more than  years ago. The Mirror tracked down his first store – now a shop selling security equipment – in Maidenhead, Berks, which he opened at the age of , with the help of a pound, loan from parents Keith and Barbara. Ross Wilson knew Mr Ashley at the time as they were both talented squash players and recalls how, even at , Ashley was driven to succeed.   “Mike was someone who wanted to rule the world,” accountant Mr Wilson, , told the Mirror. “I knew him very well through squash. He was very competitive. He liked winning and he was very clear where he was going in le. “Even at that age, he wanted to be in business and he wanted to succeed.” Sources say it was while Mr Ashley was working in a Maidenhead sports club that he hit upon turning a sideline into the start of a business. One of his early employees says: “He learnt that you could make good money from reshyshyshyshystringing rackets.” She describes Mr Ashley, whom she worked for when he later opened a bigger shop just up the same road in Maidenhead, as a “good boss”.  Yet he is now seemingly liked and loathed in equal measure. Many of Newcastle United s Toon Army, which he bought in  and apparently tried to sell on ious occasions, can’t wait to see the back of him.And he has clashed with unions over working conditions for his staff, with an investigation in  claiming locals near Sports Direct’s vast Shirebrook depot, in Derbyshire, knew it as “the gulag”. It’s a far cry from his beginnings. Michael James Wallace Ashley was born in Walsall, West Midlands, in , where his dad, Keith, was a manager at a food distribution depot. He has a brother, John, who has been heavily involved in the building of Mike’s empire. The family moved when the boys were young to Burnham, Bucks, a village on the edge of Slough. Mr Ashley went to co-educational Burnham Grammar School and old schoolmate Martin Blackmun says of him: “He wasn’t one of the popular kids and never had a girlfriend but he wasn’t a nerd either.”  Swedish glamour arrived at the school in the shape of future weathergirl and TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson and her sister, who moved there.“Everyone wanted to go out with them – I bet Mike did,” says Mr Blackmun. He may not have succeeded then but, years later, Mr Ashley met and later married Linda, a Swedish-born economics graduate. They wed in , were married for  years, went through a poundmillion orce and have since rekindled their relationship. The couple have three children – Oliver, , Anna, , and Matilda, . Mr Ashley gradually opened a large chains of shops and, in , changed the company’s name to Sports Soccer. One of his knacks was buying big-name moribund sporting brands such as Dunlop, Slazenger, Lonsdale and Karrimor and breathing new le into them. The company, renamed Sports Direct, floated on the stock market in , netting Mr Ashley poundmillion.   But his highly unorthodox style has seen him clash with the City. A High Court case in  heard claims he hosted management meetings in a pub when, on one occasion, he drank  pints and vomited into a fireplace. His wealth is now estimated at pound.billion and as well as the private helicopter, which he uses to commute to Shirebrook, he and Linda have also owned a string of luxurious homes in this country and around the world. He is also known to love gambling. On one trip to the casino he is said to have won pound.million on a single spin of the roulette wheel. However, there was also the time it was claimed he lost poundmillion in two hours in a Newcastle casino. What Mr Ashley plans to do with House of Fraser, plus potentially Debenhams and embattled HMV, is also a bit of a gamble, according to seasoned industry watchers. One former adviser told the Mirror: “He is an opportunist, a deal-maker but also a first-class retailer. But I can’t second guess him – I have given up trying to do that.” And he had this assessment of the tycoon: “He is a flawed genius. One of the flaws is that he is not everyone’s cup of tea. He’s also flawed in that he has lots of baggage.” Last November, Sports Direct issued a statement declaring that “Mike Ashley has vowed to save the high street”. Yet a month later, he said he is “not Father Christmas” and that the high street is “dying”. Whatever the case, and whatever his plans, Mike Ashley has certainly come a long way from that first small shop in Maidenhead.

However one couple found themselves being publicly humiliated recently when they were told just that and escorted off an American Airlines flight because of it. According to Yossi Adler and his we Jennie, staff at Miami International Airport booted them, and their -month-old baby daughter, off a plane telling them that they werent allowed back on due to their bad body odour. Mr Adler, a -year-old business consultant, is adamant that they didnt smell and claims his family were kicked off because they are Jewish.   The family were preparing to fly from Miami to their home in Detroit on Wednesday, when the incident occured. But their plans fell through when passengers complained they smelled bad. Speaking to WPLG Local  News, Mr Adler said: All of a sudden, as soon as they took us off, they closed the gate and then they said, Sorry sir, some people complained you had body odour and were not letting you back on. His we claims they were so confused about the whole thing, they stopped people in the airport to find out whether they did in fact smell.   After being kicked off the plane, the family say they were told their luggage would be ed to them, but that didnt happen and they were left with just the clothes on their back. Everything they needed to look after their child, including a car seat and stroller, were left on the plane. In a statement, American Airlines said: Mr Adler and his we were removed from the flight when several passengers complained about their body odour. They have been booked into a hotel for the night and given meal vouchers. They have been rebooked on a flight Thursday.

The Ukrainian blogger only stopped when a female employee ran to intervene and separated her from son Vitalik. “She was shouting – ‘I hate you’ – and all that sort of stuff,” said an eyewitness. Another said: “She was totally insane.”  Natalia, manager of the play area, said: “When the child is being kicked in his back – it is not at all a calm way to behave. “All our staff were stunned.” Police in Zaporizhia, Ukraine, were called but took no action, yet a scandal erupted after the shocking CCTV footage was released on the web. Shvetsova was hit by a wave of revulsion in messages posted to her account, which she then deleted, and on other social media. One said: “This is the true face of Instagram mums.”   Other angry comments said: “There is nothing maternal in her behaviour, there is nothing human about it either.” Shvetsova - who has previously posted from London in her ‘how to have-it-all’ account - admitted kicking her son, and also spanking him in a videoed rant where she confessed that she took her stress and exhaustion out on her son. “I throw tantrums from time to time,” she said, as she drove her car. “Didn’t it happen to you    “If you are a kind of person who never shouted at her child, who never hit her child – I am very proud of you… “I am a dferent person. I can shout, I can spank, I can reprimand.

She said: I get tired very often…” But she made clear: “I am not executing myself for having done this.” She claimed: “It is a stupid topic for discussion. “It is better to discuss shoes or knickers than some conflict… “There was the reason for this situation, and it was not about Vitalik. “But I do not want to share my problems with others.”   The Instagram mum then claimed she was suffering from “fatigue and emotional tiredness”. Her son “did not get any bruises”, she said. “He is not hungry, he is at home and he is being fed well, we do not beat him for breakfast, lunch and dinner, so please… “He has lots of toys, he goes to sports every day, he has holidays, he lacks nothing. “Please do not worry about him, he is doing well. “He is not living with his grandparents, nannies are not bringing him up, I am doing everything myself, using my own forces, nobody is helping me.   “So when I explode sometimes, you should understand that it comes from fatigue and emotional tiredness. “It is hard to raise two children on your own. “My husband is working all the time, he often goes on business trips, sometimes he does not live at home for weeks on end. “I am recording all this not in order to justy myself. “I am recording it for those who punished their kids in the same way, who feel not quite right about something. “Girls, it does happen to all of us. “When you are doing everything on you own and nobody is helping you, no grandparents, no nannies, naturally anything can happen.   “Do not execute yourself for it. “For me it is a task to work on myself, on my time management, to see where I am exhausting myself and where I should get more rest.” But other mothers hit back on social media. “The worst thing is that there is nothing about love for her child in this video. “Fed well, dressed well, I am on my own, no nannies, so I am a hero… wait, honey, and see what happens in some  or  years ” Another critic said: “In a normal county she would have been jailed already and deprived of parental rights. “Thanks to Ukrainian legislation, such socially dangerous creatures feel free in our society.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man chopped up pal 200","story":"NewsMan chopped up pal into  pieces then flushed them down toiletPintu Sharma, , was arrested over the shocking incident in Mumbai, India, when the drains became blockedShareCommentsByToby Meyjes:,  JAN NewsSuspect Pintu Sharma was arrested over the shocking incident \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man has been arrested after allegedly chopping up his mates body and flushing it down the toilet following a row.

Miriam Lancewood, , lives off the grid with her mountain man partner Peter, . The couple have been living in the wilderness for almost nine years and the one thing that Miriam misses the most isnt central heating or a proper bed - but shampoo. She explained that during their first winter in the wild she suffered from a bad bout of dandruff and had to come up with a home made solution to get rid of it. In the first winter away, I was suffering from dandruff, Miriam told Mamamias No Filter podcast.   Peter said hed heard something about the Eskimos up north who treat their dandruff with morning urine. I thought Id give it a go. What does it matter  Miriam, who is originally from Wehl in the Netherlands, said she relieved herself into a little tin before wetting her hair with some water. Then I poured the tin of morning urine over my head. I waited until I could smell the urine, and then I washed it off with soap. It works very well, she said. Washing her hair with pee is just one of many unusual things Miriam does to maintain basic hygiene while living off the grid. She also uses charcoal and ash to brush her teeth and a mooncup when shes on her period.   Speaking to the Mirror previously, Miriam said sickness, along with food, is one of their key concerns. They cannot call for an ambulance or medical assistance as they have no phones. And medical attention is often at least several days or weeks away. She added: Peter once got sick with malaria. There were no doctors and we were in the middle of the jungle. Its a very scary moment when you dont have any emergency resources. We just have to be very careful. We have a very big First Aid kit and had medicines with us for malaria. We also have to be very careful not to get in an accident. If you break a leg it would be so bad. The pair packed up their bags in  bringing just a backpack with them. We got rid of all of our belongings [when we left in ], and I had left only what we needed, she recalled. We realised you really need very little. You need two shorts, three shirts, one woollen jumper, one long [trouser], one pair of leggings, and a couple of pairs of socks. Not much.  Miriam says their first three months living in the wild were very dficult. They always have a back-up of supply of some food - which includes a very precise calculation of tea bags - but with animals scarce and her technique unpractised, they were in danger of getting hungry. My very first hunt was possum and I had to hit it on the head and I couldnt do it properly, and it didnt die, said Miriam. The animal was looking at me with these afraid eyes. I was panicked, shaking with fear. I just wanted to give up. I thought I would go hunting so I practised with my bow and arrow on a target in the garden. I thought that would be good enough for when I went hunting. I envisioned myself as a film version of Robin Hood. But in practice it was so dficult because I couldnt see any animals. I was so disappointed with myself and my hunting. I wanted to give up and had no stamina to keep going. After a few months the situation improved and they moved to an area with more animals, with possum becoming a staple. She has also switched to occasionally using a rle - a quicker and more effective hunting tool. Miriam says she does miss her family and friends, who she sees around once every three years.  They also ask hunters to post letters for them when they meet them on their travels. However, Miriam said she wouldnt trade her le to go back to working in a city. Her reality now is a far cry from when she worked as a special needs teacher in New Zealand, a job in which she found herself constantly stressed. I certainly wouldnt go back to having a job and being in a city and having a so-called normal le. I would hate to have a monotone existence where we know what we are doing next week, living round the clock where the clock is ruling your le. I have been so surprised by how much energy you get from living in nature. I think this is actually our natural state. Our ancestors lived the way we do now. Its amazing how much energy you get from just living in the forest. Compared to the mountains around me, Im very small. Your fears and worries get even smaller.Woman in the Wilderness by Miriam Lancewood is published on  November by Piatkus, and is available from Amazon."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b8691e8cfe1c.jpg ","title":"copenhagen urban designer says dundee waterfront road system like something from the 1950s","story":"One of the masterminds behind Copenhagen’s urban regeneration has lambasted Dundee’s Waterfront project.Mikael Colville-Andersen was in Dundee last week as a keynote speaker at the Sustrans Raising the Standards event.The urban developer, who was one of the key figures in transforming Copenhagen and rejuvenating cycling culture in the Danish capital, was not impressed with Dundee’s Waterfront design.mdash Colville-AndersenJanuary , While Mikael liked the VA building itself, he took umbrage with the surrounding road system, describing it as “something from the s”.He said: “I got out of the train station and saw the VA and thought, ‘oh that’s great’.“But the dominance of cars is so old-fashioned. You can’t just build a pretty building and leave it at that.

Murrayfield Terrace.A number of the one and two-storey homes would be adapted for tenants with disabilities as well as for those with additional needs.The homes would be the first “in-house” developed

Hillcrest in order to build new social homes.A flats complex which stood on the site, close to the former Longhaugh Quarry, was demolished in  to make way for the new development.Former residents had branded the old buildings an “eyesore”.A number of the flats had been vacant for some time at the point they were demolished, and the building had become a frequent target for vandals.The plans were warmly welcomed by locals when first suggested at a community meeting last August.Documents included with the application show the homes would be made with brick cladding, fitting in with other housing developments in the areaAs the local planning authority, Dundee City Council is unable to comment on its own applications.Councillors also cannot comment on upcoming applications until they go

road between North Anderson Drive and Auchmill Road.The project aims to reduce pressure on the Haudagain roundabout – once dubbed the worst in Europe.Diggers and cranes moved in last year and began tearing down a former housing estate on the site which the council said was of “poor quality” – rehoming  tenants who lived there.The proposal of application notice has been formally submitted to build a mixed-use development, but detailed regeneration plans are still to come forward.Residents have previously told the council they want to see shops and green space on the land.It was revealed last year that several retailers, who have not been named by the council, have expressed an interest in opening up on the land.However, SNP members of the opposition previously voiced concern that, under the present plans, there would not be enough green space and it would end up resembling “a pond with a bit of land around it”.Two public drop-in exhibition events are being offered for residents to look at and comment on the plans for the site.These have been scheduled for March  and  at the Henry Rae Community Centre on Manor Avenue.The exhibitions will run between pm and pm, with the first

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

In summary, Mr Anstee explained, not a lot had changed since an earlier report, though a lot of remedial work would be needed.Mr Anstee added that the question is: #What use to people want to make of the hall  Do we need it at all #The next question is whether the hall should be demolished and a new facility built or whether the facade should be retained # for which heritage grant funding may be available. A sense of frustration was evident in the hall as people heard about surveys and consultation # a familiar theme for Inspire Inveraray since its formation three years ago.Hotelier Donald Clark clearly wants to see action and is not keen on retaining the old building.

Numerous attempts to start a dialogue with the owner Archie MacArthur had failed, said Mr Anstee.One approach Inspire Inveraray is looking at is to attempt to purchase the pier using community Right to Buy legislation. There is also the question of whether to bid for the puffer, which Mr MacArthur is trying to sell, as well as the pier itself.To get to the bottom of the community#s views, consultant Charlotte Lee has been employed to pull together opinions and draw up a community action plan.Of only slightly lesser importance is the telephone box in Church Square, in which Inspire Inveraray has expressed an interest.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"caravan caught alight sparks major","story":"NewsCaravan which caught alight sparks major fire operationThe derelict property on Kilmarnock Road in Monkton went up in flames last Thursday night as the caravan attached to it caught fire.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  JAN NewsThe fire spread to the adjacent property \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA caravan which caught alight sparked a large scale fire operation as it set ablaze to a neighbouring house.

Gaenor Hardy,, has assumed control at Heathfield in Ayr, complete with its  pupil roll and  child nursery. And the shining star of the region’s education system confesses she is now “living in a bubble waiting for it to burst”. Gaenor, who joins Heathfield after heading up Dalmilling Primary for five years, said: “I was very happy there and only Heathfield would have pulled me away. “It is always the school I have aspired to. My twins came here and I feel that level of affinity. “All I see is potential. I’ve never been at a school where the surroundings in the community are so rich.” Gaenor cut her teaching teeth in south London before ing north after her sister suffered a severe stroke, aged just . She said: “It made me review my le and decide what was important so we relocated back up to Scotland. “I’ve been back here for  years now and always had one eye on Heathfield as I knew it was such an exciting job. “Part of that excitement is that I live in the catchment and my children went here so it feels like coming home. “But I’m also excited about making this the flagship school. “However, we also need to make this the hub of the local community.” Fitness fanatic Gaenor admits an “open and frank exchange of views” took place during the first meeting with her new parent council last week. It follows concerns over the previous management’s approach to alleged bullying within the school. But she insisted: “I’m all for honest, vibrant and lively dialogue. “None of it was a surprise to me as a parent myself. “I would hate to think I’ll be a comparison to previous management in the school. “What I can bring is my own unique experience to the role. “I want to be open and visible and have parents approach me. “This has to be us together on the journey.” And she added: “I don’t have to grow a passion for the school. It is there within me already. “I feel like I’m in a bubble of looking forward to coming to work and being so motivated – and I’m still waiting for it to be burst.” Now Gaenor, who is often seen walking to school, is planning to get her pupils into shape as part of a new physical and mental drive. She said: “If I want the children to be fit and healthy then I have to model that. “Health and wellbeing has to underpin everything we’re doing. “The local junor parkrun is an example of something I’d like to see encouraged. “We’ve also rolled out more than  after-school and lunch clubs from this month. “I’ll be doing a homework club and the clerical team are doing a running club so we’re all very hands on. “But ultimately the children are my inspiration. “We have a fantastic new building in which to work and I’ve never experienced anything like it during my career. “Now the challenge is to make the most of it and enjoy what we have.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"new super school riddled structural","story":"NewsNew super-school is riddled with structural problemsLeaks, faulty automatic doors and sensory lights are among a string of issues at Invergarven’s marquee campus in Girvan.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsInside the school \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new pound million super-school is “riddled” with structural problems, it can been revealed.

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

Last year, members took the decision to pay staff ndash I would hopeit happened again we would consider making similar commitments.South of Scotland list MSP Michelle Ballantynecondemned the policy, saying: ldquoIt is completely unacceptable for East Lothian Council to tell their employees to save their holiday time in case of bad weather.

My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal. Therersquos no need for an Irish backstop no membership of the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy no direct jurisdiction of the European Court and it costs less than EU membership. Of course, it does not bring the full benefits of EU membership. Britain would become a ldquorule taker on trade. But the EEA does not preclude future membership of the European Union. Norway, or any other member of the EEA, can opt for full membership at any time. And unlike the backstop, countries can leave the EEA after one year.Membership of the single market also means accepting freedom of movement, which is why it may well be rejected by Parliament. But it is the only option that has a snowballrsquos chance of getting a majority,Labour were to seriously support it. ldquoNorway plus, as itrsquos called, has more support than a repeat referendum. Fewer than  Labour MPs have called for a Peoples Vote, and only  Conservatives. The SNP has decided to throw its lot in with a repeat referendum, despite having argued convincingly for the single market for the last two years. But that isnrsquot enough.To repeat. Were it left to me, I would revoke Article  tomorrow. I just want this madness to stop. But given the metrics in Parliament, we have to look at the least worst options, as the Labour-supporting commentator Owen Jones put it last week. Mayrsquos deal is dead. MPs owe it to the country, and to themselves, to find some compromise that works. Perhaps that can only be achieved with a referendum. ButMPs fail this week, they risk destroying respect for parliamentary democracy, and opening the way for a more authoritarian form of political leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"musical-genius-or-a-wasted-talent-in-search-of-the-real-john-martyn","story":"ldquoHe was my paper boy, and devastatingly good looking, even then, says Thompson, the former we and musical partner of Richard Thompson, and folk royalty in her own right. ldquoHe always said, lsquoIrsquom going to be terribly famous, because Irsquom fabulous!rsquo He was preternaturally confident, I never met anyone so sure of himself till Rufus Wainwright, decades later. It unnerved people. From a young age, John ided people. He was dferent from other people in Glasgow, he was very free.Ten years gone this month, John Martyn is Scottish musicrsquos great gallus maverick. Though he was born in Surrey and died in Ireland, Martyn was formed in Glasgow. When his songbook is celebrated at Celtic Connections tomorrowby artists including Paul Weller, Eddi Reader and Eric Bibb, it will have the resonance of a final homecoming.Born Iain David McGeachy on September , , in New Malden, Martyn was raised by his father and grandmother in a sprawling two-storey tenement at  Tantallon Road in Shawlands. He was two when his parents orced. His mother Betty remained in Surrey, remarrying twice and having two more children. He visited her during summer holidays, but her daily absence bestowed a raging insecurity which lasted a letime.When I spoke to Martynrsquos first we, Beverley Martyn, she recounted stories of him ldquowriting to his mother and never getting any reply. Many letters were found that his mother had kept. lsquoDear mummy, I miss you so much, why donrsquot you write back rsquo lsquoI love you, when can I see you.rsquo It was heartbreaking. He was wounded from the beginning. Maybehe wasnrsquot like that we wouldnrsquot have the music, with such depth of feeling.When I interviewed Martyn in , he said, ldquoIrsquom quite sure that any flaw in my character has to do with the orce of my parents. Irsquom very sure of that.Yet he did not lack love. He was surrounded by doting cousins and aunties his gran, Janet, was strict but adoring. In Tantallon Road, music was a constant. His parents had been light opera singers, he said, all ldquohampers and stage make-up. Not really my caper. His father, Tommy, ldquosang opera for the troops, says Martynrsquos cousin, Fiona McGeachy. ldquoHe was on the radio during the war. At my grannyrsquos place, the aunts and uncles ended up in the sitting room, the fire on, granny playing the piano and everyone doing their party piece.Music was one inheritance. There were others. Martyn once told me he was bequeathed a sense of decency from his father and a wandering morality from his mother, not to mention a weakness for alcohol. Billy Connolly befriended Martyn on the Glasgow folk scene. ldquoHe was still Iain McGeachy then, says Connolly. ldquoHe was scared hersquod become alcoholic, because his father was alcoholic.:Ronnie Spector on John Lennon, Phil Spector and loving le at Martyn once said: ldquoIt runs in the family, from my grandmother on down. My old man went at  and he was still drinking, big time. At first, I drank because I was nervous performing, then the lestyle got hold of me.This was all to come. At Shawlands Academy, Master McGeachy was an outgoing, exceptionally bright student. In , he was one of three members of class B chosen to represent the school in the TV quiz show, Round Up. He was selected for a pilot project to study both Latin and French, and in  was the top English student. Though natural university material, he was already lost to music. ldquoWe hung out at a cafe in Calder Street, smoking and playing the jukebox, says Linda Thompson. ldquoLater wersquod go to folk clubs together and have fun. He was instantly quite impressive.He strolled around town in a sheepskin coat with a fur collar and stripey jeans, guitar in hand. By  he was making forays to the Glasgow Folk Centre on Montrose Street, Cliversquos Incredible Folk Club on Sauchiehall Street, the Scotia on Stockwell Street and the Crown in Edinburgh. His patron was the Falstaffian folkie Hamish Imlach, who allowed Martyn to perform before his own sets, and who grumbled good-naturedly about the curly-haired kid who left sweetie wrappers in his car.On stage, he had good patter and a few flashy tricks. ldquoHe did an instrumental on the guitar using the capo, hersquod slide it up and down, going up a half tone each time, says Billy Connolly. Inspired by Bob Dylan, he was already writing. Connolly recalls Golden Girl, which appeared on Martynrsquos first album. ldquoI wandered in the green stream that meanders round my mind, he sings. ldquoAh, he was amazing.A young man in a hurry, by spring  he had moved to London. Rechristened John Martyn at his managerrsquos suggestion, he became a boisterous fixture at folk hubs Les Cousins and the Troubadour, and was quickly signed to Island Records. His debut album, London Conversation, arrived in late . Martyn would walk through Soho with the record tucked under his arm. ldquoIt all happened quite quickly, says Fiona McGeachy. ldquoWe were awful proud of him. I would lie and listen to his music at night on my gramophone. I really worshipped him.London was about transformation. His rather refined Glasgow south side accent quickly came under assault. Depending on the context, he could sound like a Cockney barrow boy or a hard case from Barlinnie. ldquoHe would revert, it was very schizophrenic, says Linda Thompson, who had also moved south. ldquoItrsquos partly a musical thing, picking up on the tone, and partly a deep rooted insecurity to be liked and accepted. Being John, he took it to staggering s. He had dferent personalities for dferent things.His music also evolved. In , aged , he married fellow singer Beverley Kutner, becoming step-father to her baby son Wesley. The couple made two modestly successful albums together, but Martyn was uninterested in sharing the limelight. In , he embarked on a streak of remarkable solo albums, often in tandem with his closest musically ally, former Pentangle double bassist Danny Thompson.Moving out of the folk clubs onto the university circuit, he music became an exploration in sound as much as song. His vocals stretched and coarsened, taking on the cadences of the saxophone. ldquoHe had a very pretty voice, which irked him a bit, says Linda Thompson. ldquoHe wanted to sound rougher. He experimented with Echoplex, a tape delay effect which enabled him to coat his acoustic guitar in layers of spiralling reverb, a technique since popularised by KT Tunstall and Ed Sheeran. Floating between folk, jazz, soul and blues, the music was bewitching, but he often appeared hellbent on subverting its beauty. ldquoHersquod sing a beautul song like Couldnrsquot Love You More, hersquod be way into it, and after he finished hersquod belch, says Danny Thompson. ldquoHe didnrsquot want you to see his soft underbelly.Bless The Weather, Solid Air and One World are masterpieces, but virtually everything Martyn released between  and  is essential. There was plenty of acclaim, but no hits. He followed the music rather than the money.:Ronnie Spector on John Lennon, Phil Spector and loving le at During this period he ed home frequently, to work and play. When he and Danny Thompson visited Glasgow, theyrsquod stay at Tantallon Road rather than a hotel. ldquoWersquod wake up early, breakfast was porridge, prepared by his wonderful, much loved gran, the bassist recalls. ldquoThen off in a black cab for a ride out to a country spot where we jumped over the dry stone wall, then across the fields to a shallow stream. He flicked his bamboo fishing stick until six brown trout lay on the bank. Back across the fields and into the nearest pub, two pints, and acab to number . lsquoHello, Gran, trout for tea!rsquo A bit of banter then off to the local bowling green. Wersquod play and gamble with serious competitiveness. It was the same with snooker. Then wersquod ride into Glasgow and enjoy the Scotia Bar, or the Victoria. Wersquod have a play and get completely pissed and share the oxygen. He laughs. ldquoI donrsquot want to make out that it was very mumsy. We used to have serious fights as well. Irsquove been nutted by him.During this time he and Beverley had two children, Mhairi and Spencer. The family moved from Hampstead, in west London, to Hastings, and finally to Heathfield, in east Sussex. As the music soared, so Martynrsquos behaviour became more extreme and unpredictable, exacerbated by alcoholism and hard drugs. ldquoA personality was beginning to appear that was more abrasive, says Noakes. ldquoThe accent changed, there was a bit of, who are you trying to be  Split personality is too strong. John was maybe a series of inventions of characters.There is a tendency to romanticise Martyn, but some things should not be airbrushed. The loveable rogue persona played out on stage and in bars could curdle into something far nastier, especially behind closed doors. He was not just an unfaithful and largely absent husband he was also an abusive one. When Beverley fled the marriage in , she feared for her le. ldquoI slipped my feet into my sonrsquos boots and ran to the police station, she told me. ldquoI could never go back, but it left me relying on state benefits. It was hard. He mistrusted women and so treated them really badly, physically and mentally.Newly orced, Martyn bunked with Phil Collins while they worked on the rawly emotional Grace and Danger. Afterwards, he briefly moved back to Tantallon Road, where his father cut an increasingly eccentric figure. At one home town show, Tommy exited halfway through, informing his son loudly that he was leaving. In , Martyn settled in a cottage by the church in Roberton, a village in the Borders.By the time I caught up with him in , he was in rough shape. Following the end of one serious relationship, he had walked away from a baby son, severing all contact. A second physically abusive marriage had ended in orce. Locals in Biggar, the nearest town to Roberton, had grown accustomed to him acting out in the Elphinstone Hotel. ldquoPeople are somewhat astonished at the amount I drink, but itrsquos just a matter of practice, he told me. ldquoIrsquom not proud of it at all,yoursquore not careful you can make a right arse of yourself, but Irsquom by no means ashamed of it either.He had gone bankrupt, lost his house, broken his neck, and split his head open while swimming. The determination to experiment musically remained undimmed, but the muse had become a less attentive mistress.

Not that I actually did of course, for those high and wild places were a far cry from the drab unormity of the Lanarkshire housing scheme of my boyhood. The mountains instead were my escape from the mundane and a rite of passage in terms of lersquos experiences.During those long, sun-caressed summer days, grey blizzard-filled winters and endless dreich times in between, I discovered many things. Among them was how to pack a rucksack, coil a rope, tie a bowline, figure of eight or prusik knot, abseil, belay, brake with an ice axe and front point on crampons.I discovered other things too. My limits and fears, physical and mental, for thatrsquos what mountaineering is really all about, exploring the self just as much as the wild places.I was -years-old when this passionate love affair with the mountains and the worshipping of the greatest among those who ventured there began. The best of them were altogether a dferent breed.Free spirits they were, nomads, rebellious, daring and as hard as the mica schist of the Cobbler or granite of Glen Etive. The fact that many of my climbing heroes came from working class backgrounds only added to their allure.There were the Lancashire lads, Joe Brown and Don Whillans for example, apprentice plumbers when not pioneering rock climbing in Snowdonia and the Peak District. Here in Scotland there was the son of a baker from the village of Currie, Dougal Haston, who like myself began his ascent of the high places by climbing local railway bridge walls.And then of course there was the man who would come to be dubbed the Fox of Glencoe, Hamish MacInnes, a climber once described as being ldquoas tough and uncompromising as one of his own mountains.ldquoHe couldnrsquot give a damn about what the establishment thinks about him or even what his fellow climbers think of him, says Chris Bonington of MacInnes.A veteran of more than  expeditions to ious parts of the world, including the first British ascent of the Bonatti Pillar of the Dru in the French Alps, MacInnes has climbed in the Caucasus, New Zealand, South America, but also in the Himalayas, where he has been on four expeditions to Mount Everest. In , he was deputy leader in Boningtonrsquos Everest expedition that climbed the southwest face, even though MacInnes was nearly killed in an avalanche.Revered also in global mountain rescue circles, it was MacInnes who designed the first all-metal ice axe and invented the specialised MacInnes stretcher, which is used for rescues worldwide. For decades his International Mountain Rescue Handbook, published in  was the standard manual.Itrsquos hardly surprising then that to many young climbers MacInnes was a living legend whose reputation was once and for all endorsed one night when as a -year-old I went to hear him speak after he ed from a recent expedition to the fabled Mount Roraima in South America, one of the last unexplored corners of the world.Much of that evening in Glasgow ndash Govan Town HallI recall correctly ndash was a kaleidoscopic journey into everything Irsquod ever wanted to do. I listened transfixed by his tales, my eyes on stalks at the photographic images MacInnes presented that night following that great adventure in .His story of trekking through rainforests and swamps inhabited by venomous pit vipers, scorpions and giant bird-eating spiders was remarkable. The rock climb of the mist shrouded , foot sandstone wall to reach the plateau made famous in Sir Arthur Conan Doylersquos haunting  novel The Lost World, had me spellbound.That MacInnes had undertaken the climb with my other mountaineering idols, Brown and Whillans, meant that long after the talk ended, my regular climbing buddy Rab and I hovered for some time hoping to catch a few words with the great men.Tall, rangy and athletic, MacInnes finally made his appearance towering alongside the gnomic figures of Whillans and Brown. I shook hands with my heroes that night before thrusting a copy of a book in front of them to autograph. It was Chris Boningtonrsquos early autobiography, I Chose to Climb.On the bus home Rab and I basked in our encounter. Never could we have known then that some years later Rab would face a near death experience in a Glencoe gully where MacInnes himself almost once lost his le and from where he and his team of rescuers would later pluck my pal to safety.I was at home when news of Rabrsquos fall arrived. Unable to make the hills that weekend Rab had teamed up with another mutual climbing friend to tackle Ravenrsquos Gully a route high on Buachaille Etive Mor, or The Buachaille as itrsquos more commonly known among the climbing fraternity.It had been raining heavily in Glencoe all weekend when Rab and our other friend Kenny set out for Ravenrsquos. Unroped on the easier lower sections of the gully there was a sudden shower of stones from above hitting Rab on the head and knocking him over the edge of an outcrop from which he fell at least  feet.ldquoI was sure he was dead, he was lying in such a contorted way, Kenny was to tell me later. The impact of the fall had broken Rabrsquos back.After Kenny summoned the Glencoe Mountain Rescue team led by MacInnes, what followed was a dangerous operation to get Rab off the mountain, a task made all the more intricate because of his spinal injury.The rescue involved moving Rab on one of MacInnesrsquos own custom-designed mountain stretchers to an area where a helicopter could be brought in to winch Rab out before delivering him to Belford Hospital in Fort William.I was to accompany Rabrsquos parents on that journey by car from Glasgow to Belford all of us desperate to be by his bedside. Coming into Glencoe, Rabrsquos father turned and asked me on which mountain the accident had taken place. At the car park opposite the Buachaille, I asked them to stop momentarily.ldquoThere, that dark chasm near the top, I remember pointing up to the Buachaille.Tendrils of cloud and mist hung over the top of the mountain making it all the more intimidating. There was an uneasy pause before Rabrsquos mother and father turned to look at me astonished.It was only then that I realised that they, like my own parents, knew nothing of what Rab and I had been so passionately engaged with for the past few years.Throughout the time Rab and I had been coming to Glencoe and other mountain areas to climb both our parents had been oblivious to the levels of expertise we had attained, the routes we were able to tackle and the risks involved in doing so until this very moment.In an effort to draw their attention away from the towering, brooding presence of the Buachaille I recall pointing out other landmarks.A man wary of clubs and any notion of establishment MacInnes was never a member of the Creagh Dhu, but climbed with these specially talented and ultimate hardmen of Scotlandrsquos mountainsIn all his association with them only added to the aura that surrounded the Fox of Glencoe and his reputation of being among the most cunning and resourceful of climbers.It had been some years before Rabrsquos Ravenrsquos Gully epic that MacInnes had his own near death experience near the top of the route in an area Chris Bonington later called ldquothe coffin.ldquoI was trying to make the first ascent of Ravenrsquos Gully, the rope jammed and I had to take it off, it was too dangerous to go back down and had to climb solo, MacInnes recalls of that edgy day, in newly released and poignant documentary film about his le entitled Final Ascent showing at the Glasgow Film Festival this month.ldquoI jammed myself in with crampons against one wall and my back against the other, I was there for eight hours and I couldnrsquot relax for a minute,I did I would have been away, MacInnes recalls nonchalantly along with the fact he was only wearing ldquojeans and a tartan shirt, in the freezing temperatures.In those interminable frozen hours he says he assumed an almost meditative state, visualising breathing heat into his body and harking back to the experiences he read about in a book entitled: With Mystics and Magicians in Tibet by Alexandra David -Neel.ldquoThis is my bible. I first read it was when I was , it probably had the greatest influence on me and was about Buddhism and how they prepared for long trips through the desert, MacInnes explains.ldquoThatrsquos what I did and I survived, Irsquove been on hundreds of big rescues soaking wet and freezing solid but always managed to survive, he acknowledges, explaining the philosophical signicance the book had on events that near calamitous day in Ravenrsquos Gully.Watching the film Final Ascent is to quickly realise how much more this remarkable and poignant documentary is than a straightforward biopic of MacInnesrsquos mountaineering le.As the filmrsquos director Robbie Fraser says, this story is as much about memory, identity and the way in which we treat older people when they slip ndash or seem to slip ndash towards the edge, than simply a film about climbing.For it tells how at the age of  this great man of the mountains was institutionalised against his will, suffering from delirium.As the film progresses it reveals too how after a spell in psychogeriatric detainment in Belford hospital, MacInnes emerged to find his memory gone, obscured and erased as completely as a clf top by some mountain spindrt whiteout.What follows is a remarkable story of self-rescue with MacInnes hauling himself back from the abyss as doggedly as some old time climber cutting steps on an ice slope.Just as this globally recognised mountain rescuer has countless times pulled himself and other climbers out of danger and harms way, so now he sets about doing the same with this own mental health.That his enforced convalescence was in the same hospital where so many injured climbers have been taken in the past, including my friend Rab rescued by MacInnesrsquos Glencoe team, has a terrible irony.For a man who has spent so much of his le in pursuit of the sense of freedom given by climbing, his claustrophobic hospitalisation was a deeply bewildering and traumatising experience.In one of numerous ldquoescape attempts from such confinement he managed to make his way to the roof of the hospital, pursued by staff that presumably thought he was suicidal.Such a thought however insists MacInnes was the last thing on his mind, maintaining he was only in fact looking for that sense of freedom the high places have always given him.In the months that followed, using his vast archive of photography, films and writings from a -year career he began to reboot his mind.ldquoMemory is obviously very complex and one of the ways I clawed my way back to sanity was by watching a lot of my own films, he explains making hid own final ascent back to health and memory which by then ldquo per cent of which had been recovered.ldquoYou feel like a spectator looking inhellip this is how I refreshed my mind, every morning. When I wake up a piece of the puzzle comes out, he says sting through his archive.How fitting it is that climbing and the extraordinary documented adventures he has pursued for so long helped bring him back. Mountaineering and its near obsessive pull for those who engage with it have always had this special quality.My own pal Rab found out too that his desire toto the high places played a crucial role in his recovery and within a year given that the damage to his spine was not permanent, was back climbing evenhe had to wear a supporting ldquocorset for which he became the butt of many jokes.Before making Final Ascent Director Robbie Fraser says he knew next to nothing about mountaineering.ldquoWhen I embarked on this project. I thought belaying was something you did on a pirate ship, he told me over a beer.Having now worked with MacInnes I asked Fraser what he now thought of mountaineers and what made them tick ldquoIrsquove come to view climbing at the elite level as a set of contradictions. Yoursquove got a curious blend of extreme care and meticulous planning, coupled with innate, le-threatening levels of risk. Itrsquos like a massive dare, which is made all the more fascinating by the underlying fact of the non-necessity of the activity, he replies before continuing.ldquoWell, we say it is non-necessary, but therersquos obviously a deep human drive thatrsquos part of us, which says, go up that big scary thing. We have to show wersquore its equal. I often think back to the title of Lionel Terrayrsquos book, Conquistadors of the Useless, he says, referring to the autobiography of the great French climber.For MacInnes himself his recentto health has been a challenge as great as the many faces and summits to which he has devoted his extraordinary mountaineering gts.In one of the films sequences photographs of the great master at work on mountains from the Alps to the Himalayas and beyond are shown as he narrates from the great verse The Golden Journey to Samarkand by the writer James Elroy Flecker.We are the Pilgrims, master we shall goAlways a little further it may beBeyond that last blue mountain barred with snowAcross that angry or that glimmering sea.Few in the mountaineering fraternity have gone further in the high places than Hamish MacInnes. What a poignant, poetic and dramatic journey his final ascent has been.Final Ascent will be showing at GFT on March  at .pm followed by a QA with special guests Hamish MacInnes and Michael Palin."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-scots-are-merely-irritants-to-englands-desires","story":"But thanks to the miracle of the internet you canin real time without even stepping out of the house in which you find yourself now.Can lsquowalkrsquo along your old street and stop to gaze at the flat you left in search ofhellip.God knows what.

For me, as I suspect it was for many from a similar background, the migration to self-determination was as much about the creeping values of neo-liberalism and profit-at-any-cost that had begun to dominate political Conservatism as it was about any emotional attachment to an independent Scotland.You might reasonably counter with the claim that neo-liberalism and profiteering have always found a welcome in the fortresses of UK political Conservatism. In the last decade or so, however, it became possible to witness a kind of genetic transmutation of traditional Conservatism into something more malevolent and toxic.Following the  banking crisis many on the left observed the ways in which the UK political elite tried to mitigate its effects. This rested on a desire to protect big capital with tax breaks and lax scrutiny and to penalise the far greater many who had endured the worst of its effects. To ensure that such a strategy flew without close inspection by those it was designed to hurt some culprits had to be provided. Thus lsquoexcessiversquo immigration and the lsquounaccountablersquo bureaucrats of the EU were identied before being tried and found guilty in the pages of the English right-wing press, which now passes for the highest court of jurisdiction in this new hard-right ideology. For the first time many Labour supporters began to look more favourably upon the idea of an independent Scotland as offering a long-term escape route from a society that seemed to have lost all sense of a moral bearing. After independence we could shake the SNPrsquos hand send them on their way with a nice clock to recognise their long service and then set about the task of ushering in an authentic socialist republic.In the five years that have elapsed since I opted for an independent Scotland Irsquove not been its most reliable role model. I was not emotionally scarred by the outcome of the referendum. Faith, family, friendship and even old football allegiances all remained higher in my list of priorities than the struggle for an independent Scotland. Independence was a preference rather a moral imperative. I still consider myself to be an Old Labour type and do not foresee any circumstances under which I would vote for the SNP, a party which still harbours too many right-wing types and Mickey Mouse liberals for my taste. The circumstances of Brexit and the conduct of those tasked with delivering it, however, have intensied my emotional commitment to an independent Scotland.The fact that Scotland is increasingly likely to be dragged out of the EU in less than nine weeks with no viable deal, and against the overwhelmingly settled will of its citizens, initially raised obvious questions about the value of Scotlands democratic institutions. This has been accompanied throughout the last two years with a disdain bordering on outright contempt for our parliament and for those elected representatives who, like me, believe that a measure of sovereignty resides in it.Worse than this, though, as testied by events of the last few weeks, is the outright dishonesty of some of the chief Brexiters who are revealed to have been on the take from institutions with a direct interest in leaving the EU. The dangerous lies about immigration found fertile ground in empty minds and, recognising such, the UK Government is making plans for military intervention on the streets of mainland Britain. The Prime Minister is sacricing the entire economic future of this country and risking serious civil unrest to placate the whims of  Ulster medievalists. These are people who awake each day hoping that they will be caught up in the Rapture that will portend the second coming of Jesus.We are dealing with a country that has succumbed to the law of the economic jungle and where the chief architects of this are now openly mocking the rest of us as they move their fortunes offshore. If violence erupts on Englandrsquos streets we can be certain of one thing: they will be on the first Learjets out of here. In Scotland we will have one last opportunity to establish something better and more human. Itrsquos now not merely a matter of moral necessity but one of self-respect. And when self-respect goes you will permit anything to be done in your name."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-may-be-delayed-a-few-weeks-to-allow-westminster-to-process-legislation-andrea-leadsom-admits","story":"The suggestion by Andrea Leadsom, the Commons Leader, came as

Gallery of Modern Art, and Edinburghrsquos James Gillespie schools are physical evidence of Scotlandrsquos wealthy past, but are all intimately connected with the slave trade.Now a government agency has announced it will carry out extensive research to determine how the countryrsquos links to the slavery helped finance some of our most treasured historic buildings.Once completed, the work by Historic Environment Scotlandwill enable the public to better understand a dark, but important part of the countryrsquos past.Scotlandrsquos involvement in the slave trade primarily spanned the th and th centuries.Following the act of unions and new-found access to the colonies, Scottish merchants became increasingly involved in the trade of sugar, tobacco, and cotton which were all produced on plantations in the Caribbean and the United States using slave labour.Some merchants took goods to Africa and exchanged or bought slaves and took them to the New World bringing back tobacco, sugar, and cotton.Other merchants relocated to the Caribbean and built their wealth on extensive use of extensive slave labour. At one stage,  per cent of Jamaicarsquos plantations were owned by Scottish families.The main links were with Glasgow, due to its status as a major trading port, and many of the streets in the city centre belie our chequered past including Jamaica Street, Virginia Street, and the Kingston Bridge.Other streets in the city - such as Buchanan Street, Glassford Street, Ingram Street and Wilson Street are named after the th century Tobacco Lords.But the wealth the Tobacco Lords and other merchants accrued, impacted right across the country, including country estates.Buildings funded by wealth garnered from such trade included the cotton mills in New Lanark, now a UNESCO World Heritage site, the National Trust of Scotland property Greenbank Garden, Glasgowrsquos Gallery of Modern Art, The Trades Halls in Glasgow, Inverness Academy, as well as the former Bathgate Academy, Dollar Academy, Inverness Academy, and Edinburghrsquos James Gillespie schools.Professor Tom Devine, a historian who edited the book Recovering Scotlandrsquos Slavery Past, said: ldquoThere was some trading of slaves in the early th century, but it was no more than , iniduals.ldquoA lot of Scots got involved in slave trading by emigrating to places such as London and Liverpool and working as traders, seamen, and doctors.ldquoThe largest impact in Scotland was through Scottish merchants involved in the tobacco, sugar and cotton trades, which could not have existed without slaves. We are talking about black chattel slavery which was the worst of all because slaves had no rights.Professor Devine welcomed the growing interest in Scotlandrsquos links to slavery and said the country was behind other parts of the UK in ldquorecovering its past.ldquoThis new work is transforming our understanding of Scottish history in the th and th centuries. Itrsquos important work. The major breakthroughs have been made by historians in the last ten years.ldquoWhy was it that Liverpool, Bristol, and London have accepted their role in this system from the s and s  Why does Scotland have this unwillingness or unawareness  ldquoThe HES plan to exhibit the historic buildings with links to the slave trade.Lorna Ewen, head of learning for HES, said they were ldquovery conscious of the need for greater clarity on how the ldquoprofits from slavery impacted on Scottish buildings.ldquoWe anticipate that this research will focus not only on the properties in Care Estate but also on the wider historic built environment: i.e Scotlandrsquos towns, cities, country estates, industrial sites. .ldquoWe are already in contact with relevant academics and other national and cultural heritage bodies, with the aim of taking forward an ambitious research project."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-mps-face-another-moment-of-truth-with-votes-on-brexit-options","story":"But as Brexit Day on March  approaches, tensions are rising fast in Westminsterville.By Friday there were  amendments to the Brexit motion it will be up to John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, to decide which ones MPs will debate and vote on. And just to add more confusion to the already mind-numbing complexity of the parliamentary process, there are now amendments to the amendments.Essentially, there are two main proposals.One is to extend the Article  process to avoid a no-deal outcome and the other is to kill off the Irish border backstop by seeking ldquoalternative arrangements to avoid a hard border.Cross-party campaigners had been planning to put one down to secure a Peoplersquos Vote but pulled it this week because they did not have the support of Jeremy Corbyn.Indeed on Friday, Ian Lavery, the party Chairman and a close ally of the Labour leader, knocked back the hopes of those pushing for another EU vote by warning it would risk ldquoserious damage to the relationship between many citizens and politicians at Westminster.Labourrsquos official amendment calls for a permanent customs union and a strong relationship with the EU single market with the option of legislating for a public vote ie in line with the party conference resolution.However, three Labour MPs, including Edinburgh Southrsquos Ian Murray, have now put amendments down to Labourrsquos amendment, seeking to ensure a Peoplersquos Vote takes place.The first key amendment is the one calling for an extension to Article  put down by Labourrsquos Yvette Cooper.This would put Brexit Day back to December  . The idea is to give the Government time to negotiate a deal. It has support not only from Labour MPs but Conservative, Liberal Democrat and SNP ones too.What worries Whitehall about this move, unlike the others, is that it proposes new legislation to stop the clock on Brexit.The plan is to push Ms Cooperrsquos new bill through the Commons in one day: February . However, there is a plot brewing in the Lords ndash where there is no mechanism to curtail a debate ndash to filibuster and ldquotalk the law to death.Critics of the Cooper amendment smell a rat and believe delaying Brexit is just a ruse to get Britain to stay in.Some argue only pressure will force Brussels to budge on the backstop any delay would mean the EU could string things out, knowing a Peoplersquos Vote was just around the corner and the UK would vote to stay in.The second key amendment is now one backed by the leadership of the Tory backbench  committee: scrapping the backstop with ldquoalternative arrangements to avoid a hard border and backing the PMrsquos Withdrawal Agreement - subject to this change.Crucially, it seems, the Democratic Unionists are preparing to support this change and the authors of it are hoping Theresa May and her Government will also row behind it.Of course, whatever the Commons finally backs still has one more formidable hurdle to overcome ndash securing agreement from the EU, which has insisted it will not budge.Nothing is certain about how this showdown is going to end and who might forsake who."},{"url":null,"title":"orkney-named-best-place-to-live-in-the-uk","story":"The Bank of Scotlandrsquos Quality of Le Survey winner took the top prize due to itshigh employment levels, low crime rate, strong exam results, smaller primary class sizes and good health and happiness scores.Shetland, which takes second place in the Scottish table, is the only other location north of the border to break into the UK top .Ricky Diggins, network director for the Bank of Scotland, said: ldquoOrcadians will be thrilled to learn that not only is their home the best place to live in Scotland, itrsquos now taken the crown for the whole of the UK.ldquoWith Shetland and Eilean Siar coming second and third in Scotland, itrsquos a clean sweep of the podium places for these island communities.ldquoTheir more remote locations may not appeal to everyone but with benefits including high employment, low crime rates, smaller class sizes and more affordable housing, people around the country will now be dreaming of a le spent on the isles.The archipelago is also home to neolithic sites such as the Ring of Brodgar and Maeshowe.At a UK level, Richmondshire in North Yorkshire took second place, followed by Rutland in the East Midlands, Hambleton in North Yorkshire and Eden in Cumbria in fth place."},{"url":null,"title":"cross-party-call-for-peoples-vote-before-rally-outside-holyrood","story":"Scotlandrsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell called on Prime Minister Theresa May to ldquostart listening.He said Brexit should be halted and Article  extended to enable a second EU referendum with an option to Remain.Mr Russell said the refusal to rule out a no-deal Brexit is ldquounconscionable and warned it risks ldquoeconomic ruin.Mr Russell said: ldquoIt is now time, in the interests of all our futures, to show political leadership, to stop the Brexit clock, to extend Article  and to allow another referendum on EU membership, with Remain as an option on the ballot paper.ldquoWith her deal defeated by a thumping majority in the Commons, the Prime Minister needs to start listening and thinking seriously about where compromise and accord can be found.ldquoIn Scotland, at least, Brexit has not had the iding effect that wersquove seen at Westminster.ldquoIn fact, over the past two-and-a-half years Scotland has become more united than ever in support for our continuing place in Europe and against the damage that Brexit will inflict.He said the UK Government needs to ldquoface reality, adding: ldquoTinkering around the edges of their deal is a doomed strategy, no-deal brinkmanship is reckless and leaving that option on the table with just over  days until wersquore due to leave the EU is unconscionable.ldquoWe face the political challenge of our times, and we mustnrsquot allow the Brexiteer Tories to run down the clock and drag us all into economic ruin.He is due to speak at a Rally for Europe event in Edinburgh on Saturday about Scotlandrsquos future in Europe.He will be joined politicians from all major parties, except the Conservatives, including Labour MP Ian Murray, Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine and Green MSP Andy Wightman.Mr Murray said: ldquoItrsquos clear that we must seek to extend the Article  process to avoid a no-deal Brexit.ldquoLabour Party policy, as endorsed by party conference, should be to support a peoplersquos vote, and itrsquos time for the leadership to come off the fence and get fully behind this.ldquoAll political parties should be working together in the national interest, so that we can offer the people of the UK the opportunity to keep the best deal we already have as a member of the EU.Glasgow University principal Sir Anton Muscatelli will also speak at the event at Augustine United Church.A UK Government spokesman said: ldquoThe Governmentrsquos firm policy remains that we are leaving the EU on March  and that we will not be extending Article .ldquoWhat we need is to deliver on the referendum, not delay decisions.

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards. And the endless saga of RET must come to an end, otherwise how can bidding companies submit a proposed fare policy ”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

OIC Leader James Stockan has notied Ministers that the council will hand over responsibility for running the service to Transport Scotland, unless sufficient funding is provided.A year ago, a similar level of support was secured, after a y campaign by OIC for fair funding. Of this, £. million was allocated to fully fund Orkney’s internal ferry service during the current financial year, with £ million awarded to Shetland Islands Council for its ferry operations.“But this time there is no specic amount allocated to Orkney or Shetland. The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The success of the Dingwall BID depends upon our local businessesrsquo support.ldquoWe are working hard to gather information from all the businesses in Dingwall and we need to hear from everyone. This is your chance to have your say and add to the overall business plan. Then all you have to do is vote yes in the ballot and we can make these projects happen.ldquoWe really want to make sure that nobody is missed and that everyone gets their opportunity to vote because this could be a monumental time in our townrsquos history. This could become the year when Dingwall businesses take control over the townrsquos economic future.Mr Murray said: ldquoWe are aware that there must be a decenton their investment.

Itrsquos also possible we would be able to almost match fund this figure from other sources. This would be an amazing amount banked in Dingwall to be spent on Dingwall. This is how we would fund the five-year plan ready to start after a yes vote.He wants remaining surveys, seeking feedback from businesses to a number of questions, ed by Friday, February .Survey results will then be collated with a five-year business plan set to be drafted by the end of March. A yes no vote on BID would then be held in May.Gordon McIntosh, practice manager of Munro  Noble, is a director of BID Inverness and believes the scheme can pay idends for Dingwall too.He said ldquocoach ambassadors had brought more tourists into the city, increasing spend. It meant local businesses were stakeholders in any centre development plans and have the ability to lobby the council over issues of interest. The scheme also paved the way for successful events such as classic car shows, Easter egg hunts and bar and business awards.He said: ldquoWith representatives from a cross section of businesses on the board the strong advocacy we have provided has achieved some notable results.

However, health chiefs have been accused of dragging their feet over helping to find a sustainable future model to deliver the scheme, which many of the users have said gives them a reason to get up in the morning.The project leader, who is employed by High Le Highland, has been told funding will end this month.

However, the reality is that letters asking for SDS funding have been ignored.

It is now for members to decide whether to accept this offer.”Mr Swinney said the offer represented a “fair pay rise” for teachers.“It is extremely disappointing that EIS council have voted to recommend rejection of the enhanced offer agreed by Cosla earlier today and by such a narrow margin,” he said.“This offer would see teachers receive a minimum  per cent increase between January  and April , with a further  per cent rise in April .“It is a clear indication of our commitment to recruit and retain teachers, and is unmatched in the public sector.“The Scottish Government will provide the funding for pay restructuring in addition to the local government settlement.“I am pleased this offer will be put to teachers for their consideration despite the narrow EIS leadership recommendation to reject it.”Mr Swinney added: “We believe this offer represents the fair pay rise that teachers deserve and the consultative ballot planned by EIS still presents an opportunity to get this pay rise into their members’ pockets as soon as possible.“That is what is in everyone’s interests and other professional associations have already made clear that this is what they support and this is what we will continue to work towards.

Its absence soured debates over the rights of EU citizens. It also explains the bitterness over arguments about the Irish backstop. And it is an absence of trust that has shaped relations between London and Edinburgh since June .As Theresa May casts about for support for her Brexit deal, her latest appeal has been to the Scottish, Welsh and indeed Northern Irish parties in Westminster. Speaking in the House of Commons on  January, she declared that while “it will always be for Her Majesty’s Government to negotiate for the whole of the UK, we are also committed to giving the devolved administrations an enhanced role in the next phase, respecting their competence and vital interests in these negotiations”.On the surface, this was a sensible offer. What really matters in terms of the long-term future of the country is not the Withdrawal Agreement currently stuck in parliamentary gridlock, but the future UK-EU relationship. In offering this ‘enhanced’ role to the devolved administrations, the Prime Minister was trying to dilute their opposition to the former with the promise of consultation over the latter. However, as Professor Nicola McEwen noted, Scotland and Wales don’t even get a passing mention in the political declaration, despite it having massive implications for devolved policy areas.Having proffered an olive branch, May then proceeded to snatch it away. After a meeting in Downing Street last week, the First Minister reported that the Prime Minister “was keener to rule out the things she wasn’t prepared to do – extend Article , contemplate a second EU referendum” than to discuss the red lines she had laid down unilaterally back in .Indeed, the UK Government’s only substantive offer was for Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford to attend new Cabinet sub-committee meetings on preparing for the UK’s exit from the EU. “Watch us implement policies we defined despite your objections” is hardly the most enticing proposition.: Brexit: Philip Hammond refuses to rule out quitting in event of no-dealSo far, so predictable. This is typical May. It has been a striking — and, at least since she lost her majority in , dysal — aspect of her style that she is more comfortable ruling options out than opening them up. She has proved happy to make concessions on process as long as it is process heading in a direction she alone has determined.Think back for a second. Immediately after moving into Downing Street, May made her first visit as Prime Minister to Scotland. She stressed her willingness to listen to options and declared her wish to see the Scottish Government “fully engaged in our discussion”. She then proceeded to lay down a series of red lines that directly contradicted the expressed preferences of the Scottish Government to stay in the single market and customs union.The UK Government then published its EUBill, which managed to unite Carwyn Jones and Nicola Sturgeon in describing it as a “naked power grab” by Westminster.The Withdrawal Bill underlined not only the fragility of the devolution settlement, but also the willingness of London to tinker with it as it saw fit. PersonallyI suspect this was more an overwhelmed civil service trying to simply the Brexit process rather than a deliberate attempt to sabotage devolution.: Brexit: Why People’s Vote campaign is failing – Paris GourtsoyannisWhatever the truth, the Withdrawal Bill involved the relocation of powers previously held in Belfast, Cardf and Edinburgh to London as “retained EU law”. The Scottish Parliament refused consent for the EUBill and passed its own Continuity Bill, and the UK Government took the Scottish Government to the Supreme Court. The latter ruled before Christmas that the Bill was legitimate, but that placing requirements on UK ministers was not. Negotiations in court rooms, as opposed to smoke-filled rooms, is rarely a recipe for building trust.Meanwhile, in December MSPs voted by  to  to reject Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Whatever happens in Westminster, evenTheresa May can Houdini herself out of the current bind, this will not be a Brexit deal that has the consent of all parts of the UK.As one might expect, the handling of Brexit by the Government in London has not endeared May to the Scottish public. A large majority are less than impressed by the Prime Minister, with  per cent believing she is doing badly or very badly. By last October, a majorityalso viewed her either unfavourably or very unfavourably. That’s not to say Nicola Sturgeon has had things all her own way either. Brexit and what many view as the shoddy treatment of the devolved settlement has not translated into increased support for independence. As researcher Ian Montagu has explained, this has remained remarkably stable, despite increasing irritation at the Government in Westminster. And the SNP faces a dilemma of their own: according to the Scottish Social Attitudes survey, around half of independence supporters are also Eurosceptic. Between  and , the SNP’s support among this group fell by  percentage points while remaining steady among Europhiles.The creation of this schism in Sturgeon’s electoral coalition is a political problem for the SNP. Yet, May’s uncompromising style, and an inability to build up trust in the last two years, has deepened the schism between Westminster and Edinburgh. The Prime Minister’s inability to build trust through compromise could well be the character flaw that trumps her unionist instincts.Anand Menon is director of The UK in a Changing Europeand professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London.

A police investigation is taking place into the allegations made by two women and dating back to when he was first minister. But Mr Salmond won a legal challenge against the Scottish Government over its handling of the claims.The Scottish Government is carrying out a review of what happened and Ms Sturgeon has referred herself to independent advisers to consider whether she breached the ministerial code during meetings and phone calls with her predecessor. Mr Salmond said Ms Sturgeon’s focus should be on the drive to bring about independence. He said: “Nicola should be concentrating all her energies on the independence agenda where we will never have better circumstances. As far as I am concerned Westminster’s Brexit dficulty should be Scotland’s opportunity.” Ms Sturgeon is to give an update to the Scottish Parliament on her plans in the coming weeks. A formal request for a Section  order which would give Holyrood the authority to stage a referendum was rejected by the UK government last year, with Prime Minister Theresa may insisting “now is not the time” to revisit the Scottish constitutional issue amid the Brexit uncertainty. It is understood that a further request by the Scottish Government would also be rejected by Westminster.Writing in the Sunday National newspaper yesterday, Mr Salmond said: “One of our features in the national movement has been our inability to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of our political opponents. We have tended to concentrate on the shape we’re in.“However, right now the Westminster political establishment is at its weakest point in my letime while the national movement is in good heart. There is not likely to be a better time to force the issue.”However former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars warned there is “no appetite” for a second independence referendum. He said: “There is no national Yes organisation in place – a prerequisite to success as many Yes activists and voters are not SNP.“No policy work has been done on the post-Brexit situation and thus we are not in a position to deploy then new policies in that post-Brexit new paradigm that will be needed to convince No voters to vote Yes next time.”Polls indicate there has been no rise in support for independence among Scots since the last vote in  and Perth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart said a vote should be held when it can be won.He said: “We are already making progress towards that with Brexit as the catalyst. But it will be dficult to secure the conditions to make a referendum happen before the next Holyrood election.”Alex Bell, a former SNP government adviser also called for a more considered approach.He said: “The SNP and Yes have to stop seeing independence as a sneaky prize to be won when everyone  is messing up and instead base their campaign on the reality of what Scotland can achieve through an honest understanding of the world.”Ms Sturgeon had pledged to hold a second referendum in the immediate aftermath of Brexit but “reset” her plans after the SNP suffered heavy losses in the  UK election.At First Minister’s Questions last week, she said: “Given the catastrophe that Scotland faces in our economy, our society, our living standards, the prospects for the next generation and our reputation in the world, it is essential that the option of independence is open to people in Scotland.“When people in Scotland have the ability to choose independence, I believe that the country will opt to be an independent one.”The Scottish Parliament has already voted in favour of a second referendum following the Brexit vote as the SNP combined with the pro-independence Greens.\u2028Scottish Secretary David Mundell has written to Mrs May to urge her to maintain her refusal to grant Holyrood powers for a second independence referendum.If the authority to hold a second referendum through a Section  is rejected, as expected, by the UK government, it has been suggested that the Scottish Government could make this the central issue of the next Holyrood election in , as it seeks to build the case for a independence in the years ahead.\u2028Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins suggested Ms Sturgeon will seek a Section  order in the knowledge it will be rejected by in order to “stir up as much grievance and bad feeling as possible”.Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to abandon plans for another referendum. A Scottish Labour source added: “The last thing Scotland needs is more instability and chaos of yet another independence referendum, what our communities need are Labour governments here and in Westminster to end austerity.”An SNP spokesman said: “With the clock ticking down to Brexit date - and with the Tory government incapable of governing and Labour incapable of effectively opposing - the SNP will continue to focus on standing up for Scotland’s interests in the face of a disastrous Tory-driven Brexit and further austerity.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"minister hears plea for debts to be written off ","story":"Locum costs, hospital bed closures because of staffing shortages and staff retention were among the issues discussed at NHS Shetland#s annual review meeting.The Scottish government#s mental health minister Clare Haughey was attending the meeting, which was held on Monday afternoon.It came after NHS Shetland was forced to close six beds at the Gilbert Bain Hospital because of a recruitment shortfall.Director of nursing Kathleen Carolan said she hoped to have the shortage addressed within three months.Ms Haughey#s visit came after the crippling costs of travel and accommodation connected to locum medical cover was highlighted late last year.During the meeting she was challenged by Shetland integration joint board vice-chairman Allison Duncan.He warned that Shetland had spent £ million on locum cover over  months.#We already know that other local authorities like Dundee and other NHS debts are going to be written off.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players from throughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams from Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SEALL-Logo-main-300x193.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face. to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

We regard this as the most important constitutional gathering in a generation,” he said.The conference comes as uncertainty continues to remain over the issue of the Irish border backstop along with the need to ensure EU rights are protected after Brexit.Last November one thousand prominent nationalistsportspeople, artists, actors and leading business heads put their signatories to an open letter to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar outlining their concerns.

But, after representations from his solicitor, it was agreed that the fine would be waived when it was learned that no tax book had been available for the vehicle.He was held for an hour and a half in Dunmurry and was released when a relative arrived and paid the fine.The RUC men – one of whom was in plain clothes – had arrived in the area in a red Vauxhall car without markings.One Twinbrook resident said later: “So much for the RUC’s concern about the peace talks. They wouldn’t have done that sort of thing before the ceasefire.”Order is expected soon for new IRA ceasefireA NEW ceasefire order is expected to be issued to all IRA units within the next  hours. But a formal announcement by the Republican Army Council is not expected until early next week.The decision to order a ceasefire came after a second round of talks between senior Stormont and republican officials at a secret venue about five miles from Belfast on Wednesday night.In a statement issued late on Wednesday Britain’s supremo here, Merlyn Rees, said: “I am sure that the people of Northern Ireland would wish to see effective arrangements made to ensure that the ceasefire did not break down. I attach very great importance to this, and practical arrangements would be necessary.”Republican leaders are now believed to regard this as a sufficient gesture to allow them to order another ceasefire.But it is believed that they will want meaningful talks on a number of issues shortly after their ceasefire is publicly announced. Another reason why a new ceasefire is possible has been the low profile approach adopted by the British Army since the shock announcement last week that the truce was off.A key factor in the decision to call off the Christmas ceasefire was the behaviour of British units in Belfast and several rural areas where they stepped up their activity to take advantage of the ceasefire.British leaders in London are known to have been surprised at the IRA decision and there has been speculation that advice from their military leaders – who had claimed that the IRA ceasefire was certain to continue because the IRA was beaten – is now being ignored by Westminster leaders.British Premier Wilson is said to have been furious that the much-vaunted military intelligence network in Ireland was totally unaware that the ceasefire was in danger.And parallels are being drawn between the military intelligence blunder of last week and similar blunders before Internment Day and Operation Motorman – when politicians were advised that both moves would “help solve the Irish question”. IN a front page article in the Sunday World this week reporter John Keane disclosed that the , political prisoners in the Long Kesh internment camp are being held in huts which would be regarded by the EEC farming officials as unsuitable for pighouses.AdvertisementsHUNTING LODGEScotch from £.Vodka from £.Gin from £.Double litre Italian wine £.Full range of winesCans Skol p  doz Packs Lager pBrandy from £.Hennessy Brandy at £.Plus an extensive range of LiquersLámh Dearg GAC Social Club Behind Watters old pub at the top of Hannahstown Hill.A great night of singing and dancing on Sunday.ROMANOSSaturday  January - – From the top of the charts KENNYSaturday  February GLITTER BAND."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"our playground was upton cottages and arizona street","story":"IN March , an ‘Arizona Street and Upton Cottages reunion party’ was held in the Glenowen. It was a great event, with fantastic music provided by the McCourt brothers, and some equally impressive socialising done by the McKays, McDonalds, Quinns, McAteers, Pattersons, Monaghans, Lintons# and plenty of others, including a couple of Deedses.The oldest party-goer was Mrs Sheila Deane, at a brave  years of age. I got speaking to MrsDeane that night and as always, she had a smile on her face and was in good spirits. Sadly, MrsDeane passed away on January this year.The street was our playground growing up in Arizona Street Upton Cottage in the ‘s and ‘s. We were never in. While our parents probably appreciated this, I’m not sure that all of the older residents enjoyed the noise and occasional nuisance as much. Some of our older neighbours when passing might have greeted us young ones with no more than a scowl, a grunt, or even worse . Mrs Deane however, was friendly and approachable every time you saw her. Uniquely as well, she always remembered my name. My brothers and I were very good friends with MrsDeane’s grandsons Neil, David and Mark, just down the street. Every night since I can remember, their dad Seamus made the short trek up the street past our house to visit his mum in the cottages. I spoke to Seamus recently and he kindly shared some of his own, earlier childhood memories of our wee street.Mr and Mrs Deane moved in to number  Upton Cottages on the Glen Road in , and at that time the street was still not too dissimilar from the way it looked when the houses were first built. Upton Cottages first appears in Belfast Street directories in , when they formed the only small terrace resembling a street anywhere in West Belfast beyond the Falls Road. At that time, and for almost another  years, the area beyond Upton Cottages marked the start of the country, and there was very little to be found after it going up the Glen Road apart from farms and fields. The single-sided Arizona Driveappears in the street directories for the first time in , with the opposite side and new name of Arizona Street listed the following year. Several other homes of ying size soon began to spring up along the Glen Road around the growing parish of St Teresa’s. Gransha and Andersonstown estates followed shortly after and the whole area became much less rural in character. One former resident of Woodland House on the Upper Springfield Road remembered walking down the Turf Loney to go to Sunday school on the Glen Road in the s, only to be chased back across the stream at Upton Cottages for being ‘country children’!Still, in  the area was unrecognisable from how it looks today. Beyond the cottages was all fields going right up from the Falls to Hannahstown Hill. Before Turf Lodge was built to meet the rapidly increasing demand for social housing in West Belfast, Seamus Deane remembers playing from dawn to dusk in the meadows there throughout his childhood. Arizona Street, Seamus recalls, was still only three quarters built in the ‘s. In fact, the house that I grew up in near the top, and any others after number , were built around a decade later. These were known as the ‘corporation houses’, having been appended to the existing houses by the council in the ‘s. In the s Sheila Deane and her family looked out at a single four bedroom house – number  Upton Cottages and the first on that side – beside which was Sherf’s timber yard . Both sites would later be taken up by McErlean’s Bakery that employed generations of the area’s youth. Before the bakery was built however, long piles of timber from Sherf’s yard lay in the field between the Deanes’ house and the bottom half of Arizona Street. The vacant ground beside it, part of which would one day become our back garden, was the site of the annual bonfire. According to one older resident, there had been an orchard there in even earlier times. Geraldine Mallonwho told me this was someone I was heart scared of as a child. She and the neighbour facing her, Jim Butler, were tortured by us kids kicking balls and hitting sliotars around their doors. And they were never too slow in coming out to tell us to take them away to hell’s gates. Ironically, both Jim and Geraldine became good neighbours of mine when I got older and moved in beside them, and we stayed friendly until they passed away in recent years.Other former residents of Upton Cottages include members of the RIC, a private in the Free State Army and two soldiers who lost their lives in the First World War, one of whom is among the Canadian Infantry buried in the City Cemetery.And the street keeps changing. Like so many other families, MrsDeane’s children and grandchildren are scattered near and far. Her sons Paul and Seamus continued to make their daily pilgrimage up our street back home to see their mum until her final days. This special lady won’t be forgotten, nor will our memories of a grand wee community – one of the last of its kind – that has spread out across our beautul former meadows from the Falls to Hannahstown, and further afield."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"toibin to host new party belfast meeting","story":"FORMER Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín has said that his new party hopes to select candidates for the North’s upcoming Council elections by early February.The Meath TD left Sinn Féin in November over the party’s decision to back legislation allowing for abortion.The as yet unnamed party is set to host a meeting at the Malone Lodge in Belfast this Monday with a view to setting up local branches.Speaking to the Daily Belfast ahead of the meeting, Mr Tóibín said it was not his intention to “clip the ear off” Sinn Féin based on his past experience, but rather to build a “broader” republican party.“I believe over the last year that Sinn Féin has narrowed its ideological space, both economically and socially,” he said.“It has flipped its policy on a number of social issues. In , the party would have been openly pro-le. In , they’ve gone the opposite direction.“I also battled internally for the last two years to make sure I could be part of the Oireachtas team on an equal basis, but because I had a dference of opinion on the issue of abortion that just wasn’t allowed. I wasn’t given the chance to equally participate in the organisation.“For example, the leadership of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou, went to London recently and asked Westminster to legislate on three separate areas for the North of Ireland – that’s unheard of in republican terms. For  years republicans have tried to stop them legislating on Ireland.”He continued: “The party is also caught in a way in that it wants to reach middle-Ireland more, maybe looking at winning seats in leafy liberal Dublinit can, reaching out to the media too, but there is a big danger that it will lose its grassroots base. I think the Presidential campaign was an example of where the grassroots became so disempowered that they didn’t come out for the organisation.”Mr Tóibín insists that Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Fianna Fáil, and Labour have positioned themselves on the same space, and that his party hopes to attract disillusioned members. Asked about his party’s policies, beyond being pro-le, Mr Tóibín said: “We are for the unity of the Irish people North and South and we will be reaching out the hand of friendship to people from a Protestant background, people who wouldn’t have been able to vote for Sinn Féin in the past, for many reasons. “We’ll also be reaching out to people who believe that the Tories have made such balderdash of Brexit, and have had their rights to self-determination taken away with regards to remaining in the EU. For us, economic justice issues are very important. Right now we have people in the North who are in food poverty, housing poverty, health poverty and yet we have stalemate at Stormont.”He contined: “We need the governments to institute joint authority in the North. We also need to make sure that there is serious work done on the All-Ireland economy. It was sold to us as part of the Good Friday Agreement, but it had fallen off the agenda for many political parties. It will be one of the greatest tools toameliorate the effects of Brexit. “Another point, and I think, Sinn Féin have been remiss on this, we want an independence referendum, but we can start to deconstruct the border in the meantime. “The border is made up of thousands of dferent bricks, which stand for a practical experience in someone’s le. It could be a cross-border ambulance service, a cross-border health service, cross-border education, or corporation tax – a cross-border soccer team. Every time we fix those issues, we create convergence North and South, we improve the delivery of services and the quality of le for people, and the height of the border starts to reduce in height.”Mr Tóibín has said his party hopes to stand between  to  candidates across Ireland, and has already attracted nine elected councillors. Asked about the number of candidates standing in Belfast, Mr Tóibín said: “We won’t get into the micro details just yet. Hundreds of people are joining us on a weekly basis. New cumainn are being set up around the country, and we have new cumainn that will be set up in Belfast. “We want to make sure that we are an activist based grassroots organisation. If we get that infrastructure set up around the six counties then we hope to be selecting candidates by early February in places we believe we can win seats.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-24-at-16.25.07.png","title":"womens place in national debate","story":"LAST year was a year to remember for women’s rights. ‘Me Too’ was a phrase heard around the globe as artists in many spheres made sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination visible. It was a lesson that went way beyond the arts.The referendum on the th Amendment to the Irish constitution made the experience of women visible in multiple ways. It was not merely about the personal heartbreak of inidual women, it was also about systemic oppression of Irish women and children, and reached into the earth of Tuam, County Galway, where babies’ bodies had been buried in an unconsecrated septic tank by nuns and priests.It was the year that celebrated  years of some women’s franchise and paid homage to suffragettes and the first woman MP, Constance Markievitz.With the election of Clare Bailey as leader of the Green Party we now have women leaders of four of the six mainparties. In many ways it all seemed seminal. That women’s agendas could no longer be ignored. However, we are all too aware of its limitations too. The words ‘The North is Next’ regarding access to full choices in pregnancy clearly require the addition of ‘at some point’.Women’s participation in politics, while improving, remains poor. In the forthcoming council election watch how many women are standing in winnable seats and watch which parties do what. A fair enough group photo of gender balance announcing candidates is often at quite a distance from the elected officials’ photograph afterwards.Just as in , contemporary strides on women’s rights need to be carefully looked after in the years to come. While Cumann na mBan and feminism were integral to the operation of the First Dáil and the appropriation of public le during the Tan War, what we witnessed afterwards was an assault on women’s rights, from the constitution to the maternity ward afterwards. In the north the oppression of women went hand in glove with the oppression of the nationalist population in the right wing statelet.Right now, there is a conversation happening about what a new Ireland might look like. The conversation focuses on constitutional rights, economic interests and demographics. Campaigns feed into it with social and cultural rights featuring intermittently.What we have failed to do is insert the vibrant and rich debate last year on women’s rights into this national debate in the meaningful way. For instance, women who cannot be equal participants in our society because their citizenship and culture are denied to them are doubly oppressed as women are unequal participants in so many avenues of le.Just as in - when Irish suffragettes gave expression to their fight for self-determination being linked to their country’s fight for self-determination, we need to seek out space and language for a modern Irish women’s vision. Indeed, in those years Irish suffragettes’ colours were not purple white and green – they were orange, white and green. It was a bold statement of intent: that women would not be written out of the Proclamation or a new Ireland.That new Ireland was never realised with the imposition of partition. Specic attention must now be paid to women’s participation, needs and aspirations as we build our new vision for a transformed Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"dup under pressure from within to get brexit deal to end border poll calls report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

BlairNo deal could be disaster for horse racing and breeding, warns trainer HamiltonMr Varadkar was speaking after Chancellor Philip Hammond had pulled out of a  discussion on Europe he was participating in, alongside a number of other European leaders in Davos.The Taoiseach said that a no-deal Brexit would result in a period of \"chaos\" and that Ireland would have to negotiate with the EU and UK to avoid a hard border.The UK is currently on course for a no-deal Brexit, with no agreement in place ahead of the UK leaving the EU on March .Prime Minister Theresa Mays Brexit withdrawal plan was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs earlier this month.Mrs May presented her Brexit \"Plan B\" to the Commons on Monday, with MPs set to vote again on January .Mr Varadkar said Ireland would face a \"major dilemma\"there is a no-deal scenario.\"Ireland has obligations to protect the single market, the United Kingdom would have a responsibility to abide by World Trade Organisation rules, and both the United Kingdom and Ireland would have responsibilities to honour the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process,\" he said.\"So I think wed end up in a situation whereby the EU and Ireland and the UK would have to come together and in order to honour our commitment to the people of Ireland that there would be no hard border, we would have to agree on full alignment on customs and regulations.\"The Taoiseach said that he thought Mrs Mays Brexit deal was the best option on the table.\"After a period of chaos we would perhaps end up exactly where we are now, with a very similar deal,\" Mr Varadkar said.\"The truth is nobody can know for sure what would happen in a no-deal scenario, thats why we worked so hard over the past two years to put together a withdrawal agreement.\"Responding to the comments, DUP MP Nigel Dodds said that his party was committed to seeing a Brexit deal that worked for people in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.However, he said that he rejected Mr Varadkars \"analysis\" and called on him to work \"constructively\" to reach a consensus.\"It is not a constructive contribution when we are focused on trying to reach a consensus,\" the North Belfast MP said.\"In any case, the Taoiseach’s comments about the Belfast Agreement actually ride a coach and horses through that Agreement. \"Mr Varadkar is evidently and understandably concerned about the impact of a ‘no deal’ on the Republic of Ireland but this is a time to tone down the rhetoric and keep cool heads.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dunlop family supportive of michaels

But it is not an automatic approach.“Particularly at times when there are big changes, you have to have some constants and for a central bank there are two constants: have a financial system that s, which we would havethat were to happen, and keep your focus on your democratically given mandate, which is to achieve the inflation target.”Inflation last month fell to .%, within touching distance of the Bank’s % target.Mr Carney also said that British businesses cannot completely prepare for a no-deal Brexit due to a lack of infrastructure at UK ports.“There are a series of logistical issues that need to be solved, and it’s quite transparent that in many cases they’re not.“So, port infrastructure is not there, border infrastructure is not there to the extent that it would need to be from jumping from an absolutely seamless trading environment to one with frictions that aren’t just tarfs, but are rules of origin of products, safety standards and other inspections that would need to be done.“There is a limited amount businesses can do to preparethere are going to be substantial delays on the logistical side”.He used the example of logistics and supply issues that could arise for UK carmakers from a no-deal Brexit.“If you are a car plant that relies on  -wheelers [trucks] coming through Dover a day, and they have to show up within minutes of each other in order to meet the just-in time-requirements of the plant, you can’t stack things up all over Wales in order to ensure that you can continue to run it for months. That’s just reality.”At the , the audience was asked for a show of hands to indicatethey were in favour of a second Brexit referendum. Mr Carney abstained, but UBS boss Sergio Ermotti raised his hand."},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say january","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

bomb","story":"Proposals for a Derry City Deal have just been submitted to the British government for ‘review and development’, it has emerged.The secretary of state for Northern Ireland was this week asked about the progress of a City Deal for Derry in the wake of the weekend bombing and subsequent unrest in the city.Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, fielded questions at a meeting in the House of Commons, during which the Bishop Street car bomb was high on the agenda.  The meeting heard that the terrorism threat level in NI remains ‘severe’, however, the threat level in GB from NI paramilitaries is still deemed ‘moderate’.Labour MP Mike Kane joined with others in condemning the ‘appalling terrorist attack’ and welcomed the strong community response of the ‘good people of Derry’.  He then asked the secretary of state about the progress of ongoing negotiations for a City Deal in Derry.In response, Ms Bradley said: “There is a process by which all city regions applying to get a city deal go through.  Those negotiations are ongoing and the work is being done by the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Governmentand the treasury to make sure the Derry and Strabane City Deal can be delivered.”Yesterday, in a statement to the Derry News a spokesperson for the MHCLG, explained that a set of proposals have been submitted to the UK government this month which are currently being reviewed.She said: “We remain committed to negotiating a Derry and Strabane City Deal and recognise its importance to the local area.”“At Budget  we announced that we were officially entering into negotiations with local partners on a Derry and Strabane City Deal.  Since then, officials met local partners in Derry in December to discuss their emerging proposals and the next steps.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“This month, Derry and Strabane Council have submitted a set of proposals to UK Government, which we are now reviewing and on which we will work proactively with local partners to develop.”In July of last year the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, attended a meeting at the Magee Campus in Derry where he said Northern Ireland has been leading the way within the UK in productivity growth and he wanted to ‘support this progress by inviting a bid for a Derry City Deal’.However, there has been little by way of an update since Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, James Brokenshire, appeared in Derry last August.  At the time he made no concrete commitment that it would be delivered, saying it would require a ‘detailed submission’ of proposals and ‘further dialogue’.A successful bid could see a signicant sum of money injected into the local economy.A previous recipient of a city deal which would be comparable to that of Derry and the North West is the Inverness and Highland City Region in Scotland which received a commitment of £m in public funds, from the UK government, local council and regional partners – which will be invested over - years.Inverness invested in roads, housing, internet connectivity and science and technology, however, Derry’s plans are believed to be ‘much more ambitious’, according to those involved in negotiations.Derry has been lobbying for such a deal for years, however, in November of last year it was snubbed when the Chancellor announced plans for a Belfast City Deal instead.According to statistics published last year the Derry City and Strabane District Council area has the highest levels of unemployment in the country."},{"url":null,"title":"tommy tiernan announces extra shows

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card. Malone then scored from a tap penalty to take a - half-time lead.The second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Ballynahinch going further behind to another try from the prolic Campbell after another lsquoHinch mistake on their own line out.Ross Adair reduced the arrears on  minutes with a converted try to put lsquoHinch in bonus point territory and the away side belatedly roused themselves to pile the pressure on Malone during the final ten minutes.However, the home defence held and lsquoHinch had to settle for a point, earned largely through the woes of the Malone place kicker, who failed to land any of his attempts on goal.A disappointing start to  for the locals and they will need to be more accurate this week as Ballymena come to Ballymacarn Park.Malone Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan’s Emma hoping to make waves at Abu Dhabi Special Olympics  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN swimmer is hoping to make a big splash when she goes to the Middle East in March.Twenty three year-old Emma Carlisle will be going for gold when she swims for Ireland at the  Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi.Emma is one of seven athletes from Co Down included in the -strong Team Ireland squad for the Games which take place over March -.Newry is well represented with four athletes selected.

She suffered from the heart condition Tricuspid Atresia.Mrs Trainor has described the decision to send babies to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool after the provincersquos paediatric pathologist retired as ldquoinhumane.She believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.In addition, Mrs Trainor believes the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.Addressing last weekrsquos meeting, Mrs Trainor described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service, knowing that a senior pathologist was retiring.ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le, she said.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.ldquoI am not sure what provision would be in place for parents to accompany the child, but to send them on such a journey is heartbreaking. The entire family circle suffers when something like this happens.Mrs Trainor said the decision to hold post-mortems in England was the ldquosingle, most horrying thing she has ever heard.She continued: ldquoThe health service never ceases to amaze me and once again due to a lack of foresight, planning and finance, we find ourselves in what is an unforgivable situation, she continued, commending Newry, Mourne and Down Council for recently highlighting the post mortem issue.ldquoI am not the only person who has lost a child, quite a few people have and there are those who would join me to meet with Mr Pengelly to explain that sending babies across the water for post mortem is just not acceptable.The health campaigner believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, admitting she would also be in favour of an all island service.ldquoSending babies away is not an option and while an all island option is better than sending babies to Liverpool, I believe we must have this service provided here, she declared. ldquoWe need to meet with the Permanent Secretary as soon as possible on this vital issue.Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady said it was his understanding that there were strains on pathology services across the province due to workforce issues.ldquoIssues like this happen over a period of time and you sometimes wonder just how much attention is given to the planning aspect, he said.ldquoHow do officials plan for the future  It is not just enough to commission a report on the issue and put it in the bottom drawer and announce you are several thousand nurses short when you have had ample opportunity over several years to train more.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, who attended last weekrsquos meeting in Downpatrick, said holding post-mortems in England ldquowill bring untold pain and suffering to families in their darkest hour.He added: ldquoWe must do everything within our power to try and bring a resolution to this resource issue including examining a North-South approach. Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

He also warned that “in the context of Irish politics and history...those things become targets”.His comment sparked a backlash from unionists who dismissed the claims as “unhelpful” and “foolish”.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said: “The taoiseach losing the run of himself again”.Mrs Dodds tweeted: “Deeply unhelpful and foolish comments which he knows are nonsense. Also very irresponsible given the connotations.” Her party colleague Gregory Campbell MP said: “It begs the question why there were numerous scare stories about fences, walls, violence and checkpoints “Why were genuine border communities fed a diet of doomsday scenarios about queues at the border, no more cross border trains, the lights going out  All the scare stories lie exposed as nothing more than spin and an attempt to manipulate the fears of good people living in border communities.” In the interview with Bloomberg TV, Mr Varadkar was asked to “paint a picture of what that border is going to look like ”He replied that in a worst-case scenario, a hard border could “involve people in unorm and it may involve the need, for example, for cameras, physical infrastructure, possibly a police presence, or an army presence to back it up,”Mr Varadkar went to say that Ireland had already agreed to address some of the UK’s main concerns, and added: “Why is it that the country that is being victimised is the one that’s always asked to give ”Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson said the taoiseach’s interview “evokes memories of the days of Charlie Haughey” and added: “This is very serious talk from Mr Varadkar and will only serve to wind things up.“Why would he want to raise the prospect of putting Irish troops on the border at such a sensitive point in negotiations ”Sam McBride: A small band of DUP members always opposed Brexit, fearing for the UnionBen Lowry: Dublin is in no place to lecture UKBrexit ‘no deal’ it has helped bring close actually happens Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Steve Aiken, UUP MLA for South Antrim, said: “With the continued uncertainty in Brexit negotiations, this is a time for cool heads. In that context, it is shocking that Leo Varadkar should throw comments in about soldiers on the border. Instead of reducing tensions, he is ramping them up.”Within hours of Mr Varadkar’s interview, the Irish government issued a statement playing down the signicance of the taoiseach’s claims.A spokesman said: “The taoiseach made it clear in the interview that the government is determined to avoid a no deal scenario and the consequent risk of a hard border.“He was asked to describe a hard border, and gave a description of what it used to look like, and the risk of what it could look like in the worst case scenario.

Mr Varadkar added: “We’d have to negotiate an agreement on customs and regulations that meant full alignment, so there will be no hard border.”We would “have to” negotiate “full alignment”, he said.Uh, no. We would not.It would be welcomeonce — just once — a UK minister slapped down a lecture from Dublin about what Britain “must do” .Instead, for two years the government of a nation of  million people, the world’s sixth biggest economy, has stayed mute after scoldings by the government of a nation of five million people. There was a time, in the run-up to the  backstop, as Irish demands became clear, when influential Tories, from Lord Hague to Nick Timothy, publicly challenged them.Dr Liam Fox, from within the government, did so too, saying Dublin was trying to get commitments on the border too early, before the shape of trade relations was clear.But that criticism died away and Theresa May signed the backstop in December , which largely acceded to Dublin’s demands, albeit with a paragraph inserted to rule out an Irish Sea border .Even when Mr Varadkar showed EU leaders a picture of a  IRA attack on a customs post, to highlight the security risk , London was too polite to speak up.It could have pointed out thatthe major European powers gave full moral support to the UK during the decades of IRA terror, while Ireland was the weak partner in that long effort to stop the bloodshed.Britain is similarly reticent in Stormont talks. The UK is always neutral including, for example, when Simon Coveney backed Sinn Fein’s Irish language act demand.Ben Lowry: Far from being a hangover month, January brings the joy of renewal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Coveney also said the detention of the dissident terrorist Tony Taylor was “contributing negatively to community tensions”. Taylor is the ex IRA man who abused the goodwill of his early release on licence under the Belfast Agreement, committing a later terror offence.Did London dare to rebuke Mr Coveney implicitly by saying ministers would continue to make protection of le and property from terror a top priority  Of course not.Last year some bullish unionists suggested the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference would not even be reactivated, but it was.I thought a climbdown on the backstop was coming after hearing the emollient tones of David Lidington and Karen Bradley at the early November meeting. Within weeks Mrs May had indeed agreed what she said no UK prime minister could agree, an internal border.She did try to make customs alignment UK-wide, to avoid tarfs in the Irish Sea, but while Great Britain might one day break free from EU on customs, the backstop Irish veto means Northern Ireland will probably never be allowed to do so.This proved intolerable to MPs.When Jeremy Corbyn cites the status of Northern Ireland in his opposition to the Withdrawal Agreement, and when right-wing Tories do the same, their opposition is also driven by factors that have nothing to do with NI. But the prospect of NI’s place in the UK being put in jeopardy by an arrangement that has unforeseeable long-term impact triggers genuine concern at Westminster as to the integrity of UK territory .Dublin has played the uber Brussels loyalist. Last March I wondered on RTEthe EU might ditch Ireland as talks deadlines got close. It didn’t. Latterly on southern media I said Irish tactics had worked.Irish commentators pointed out that the EU was always going to stand by a member state, as it did. Some UK observers noted that for the first time in centuries Ireland was more powerful than Britain because it had stuck by an EU that represents a much bigger population and economy than the UK.If that is the end to the story, and Dublin’s gamble has paid off, then fair enough. Butnot, they deserve little sympathy. The full NI-Republic alignment Mr Varadkar says “must” happen will have signicant implications for sovereignty. Agreeing to such might make pragmatic — albeit grim — sense, to get a good deal with the EU powerhouse. But it makes less sensethe EU and Dublin have made a deal impossible.Many Irish voices mock a UK “fantasy” vision of future trade with countries much further away than the EU bloc on Britain’s doorstep.Yet Ireland has done something similar. It has with almost slavish loyalty hitched itself to major European economies that are further away from Ireland, and of less relevance to it, than the big economy that is on its doorstep: the UK.If no deal is the outcome, Britain might be best to ignore Mr Varadkar’s lectures as to what it must do.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorBen Lowry: Far from being a hangover month, January brings the joy of renewal JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8785700.1548498383!/image/image.jpg","title":"ben lowry far from being a hangover month january brings the joy of renewal  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat s News News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Ben Lowry: Far from being a hangover month, January brings the joy of renewalSunrise near Hawkhurst in Kent on Thursday, as the cold weather continues and as the days get gradually longer.

Now it does not set until almost pm.In little more than three weeks, on February , the dusk will be as late as .pm —it is bright, it won’t seem dark until after pm.Many people complain about January as being a ‘hangover’ month. It even contains a day, Blue Monday, the third Monday in the month, which is said to be the most depressing day of the year.This is based on things such as the distance from Christmas, the failure of new year resolutions and the debt from the festive season.Not for me is it depressing.Late January is the glorious beginning of the best part of theyear: the sense of renewal and hope, amid inklings of spring, but most of all the re-emergence of daylight.The days will gradually get longer and longer, for five months.And every so often, we will get a day of mostly sunshine, beginning again to arc high in the sky, from early morning to early evening.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorBen Lowry: Dublin is in no place to lecture UKBrexit no deal happensJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8785718.1548502622!/image/image.jpg","title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Leo Varadkar talks up prospect of troops on Irish border after a lsquono dealrsquo BrexitLeo Varadkar has been accused of #losing the run of himself# and peddling #scare stories,# after the taoiseach claimed a botched Brexit could put troops back on the Irish border.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

I really enjoy it and it allows me to work from home.”Courses cost from £ and include tea coffee and scones. Mary-Anne delivers savoury cookery classes as well but explained that baking is far and away the most popular.“I wasn’t actually trained as a pastry chef but there has been such a resurgence in the popularity of baking. That is where the demand is. I would love to do more cookery classes where people can learn to do savoury foods too, however the majority of bookings are for those sweet treats we all love. I like to combine traditional recipes and new flavours. Local, seasonal and organic ingredients are key.”Each course can accommodate - people and are booked out weeks in advance. All recipes andequipment are provided and you get to take home what you make.“My style is informal, it’s all about having fun. I do hands-on and demonstration classes and cater for all levels from complete beginners to more experienced cooks. The aim is to get stuck in.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed. According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/prog_1.jpg","title":"leaders in business darina armstrong","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Darina Armstrong’s career within the Progressive Building Society began at a young age, working her way up to leading the organisation since  – almost  years after first starting with the society.“I absolutely love everything about the business. I love the mutual ethos, and that we are fundamentally there to help the community,” she told Ulster Business.“We have to make a , but fundamentally we are there for the good of society. I passionately believe that home ownership is a good thing. And I passionately believe that savings are a good thing, and that’s what our business has been doing for more than  years.”According to its latest full-year figures, ending in December , Progressive posted pre-tax profit of £.m.In the last year, it helped more than , people buy their home and almost  to build a new home, with overall new mortgage lending of around £m.It’s weathered some of the most dficult years in the residential property market here, with Northern Ireland prices plummeting in the wake of the recession in .“We are battling our way through that – the housing market hasn’t fully recovered through it. The number of new developments probably aren’t servicing the needs of the demand. We still have an issue out there.“Slow, and modest growth is happening at the minute. But that’s good, and that’s sustainable. Affordability is very good in Northern Ireland and the economic factors, even with Brexit, are good.”Progressive now has  branches and more than  staff spread throughout Northern Ireland.For Darina, it’s about working hand-in-hand with the customer, and ensuring everyone in the team in the same mindset.“For me, it has to be doing right by the customer. Once your staff are fully on that journey too, they know they are doing the right thing,” Darina says. “They aren’t forced into sales targets – they want to get the right product fro the person, and making it as easy as they possibly can.“In part, to hand hold. There are some cases where deadlines don’t happen, things don’t go according to plans – for example, in a housing chain, someone can drop out. It’s about being there, and being able to help.“There is still a demand for people to buy houses – that hasn’t changed at all.”Darina took over at the helm in , while the property market in Northern Ireland, and throughout the UK, was still going through tough times. But she believes it has normalised since then.“Things are picking up,” she says. “We have the experience here to keep going in a direction that suits the demographic that we serve.“We are here for the long-term, and factor that in. Ultimately, it has to be right for the consumer.“It’s also about the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s not just Belfast-centric, and we have to extend our reach. There’s good activity in dferent parts of Northern Ireland, and that’s where our roots are.”And after more than  years with the organisation, Darina says she has no plans to jump ship to another financial business.“I am totally bought in to the mutual ethos. For me, it’s all about the customer. I would struggle where decisions would be made for shareholder , or short-termism.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
