And never more so than on their tour of Australia.Every photocall and walkabout, from rain-lashed barbecue to sun-drenched beach, could have come from a film set.

Loving glances and intimate giggles under a shared umbrella? You can almost hear the line from Four Weddings And A Funeral: ‘Is it still raining? I hadn’t noticed.’The last time we saw this sort of Hollywood mega-watt beauty offset by puppy-like devotion was in Notting Hill, where a dazzled Hugh Grant does his best to keep up with Julia Roberts.  Forgetting Sarah Marshall: Wearing garlands on Bondi, just like Mila Kunis and Jason Segel in the 2008 filmOr how about our happy couple descending the steps of the Sydney Opera House, hands intertwined, as our leading lady gazes adoringly at her man? It’s not a million miles from Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday.Even their attendance at the opening of the Anzac Memorial had me thinking back to Richard Gere and Debra Winger in An Officer And A Gentleman.   Roman Holiday:  As Audrey Hepburn learned in this 1953 classic with Gregory Peck, being a royal on tour can be a bit of a drag.

He doesn\u0027t contact us. John was quite delicate all along.\u0027Indeed his lifestyle in South London is so reclusive and quiet — and his attitude to fame so hostile — that the band apparently don\u0027t expect him to respond when they contact him.His wife sometimes tells callers to their home that he \u0027doesn\u0027t live here\u0027, or that she \u0027doesn\u0027t know where he is\u0027.Neighbours say that they are aware that he lives next door, but they barely see him from one year to the next. The only exception was the local pub, where he used to call in three times a week for a glass of white wine with his wife — but it has now become a supermarket.So why is he so reclusive?          This week, just a few miles away, his former friends Brian May (left) and Roger Taylor (right) strolled up the purple carpet at the premiere of the film Bohemian Rhapsody (Rami Malek, centre, who plays the role of Freddie Mercury)Drummer Taylor describes him as a \u0027sociopath\u0027, while May suggests that Deacon has never recovered since a booze and drug-soaked period which he implies led to a breakdown more than 35 years ago.Extraordinarily, Taylor says they haven\u0027t spoken in more than a decade. \u0027I haven\u0027t heard a squeak from John, not a single guttural grunt,\u0027 he adds. \u0027We\u0027re not in touch but John\u0027s a sociopath, really, and he\u0027s given his blessing to whatever Brian and I might do with the brand — and we\u0027ve done rather a lot.\u0027May says he contacts Deacon often to ask permission for various commercial enterprises to do with Queen (Deacon remains a quarter shareholder in Queen Productions Limited) but it\u0027s not clear how much of a response he gets.The company is blue-chip to say the least — turnover was recorded at £18.5 million in 2017, with that figure set to swell thanks to the new film.Not that you would suspect such riches from his unassuming home in Putney, which he bought with his first royalty cheque.He\u0027s never moved, because he didn\u0027t want to disrupt the schooling of his six children. This quiet living is the exact opposite of the showy excesses of Queen.          John Deacon, left, Freddie Mercury, centre, and Brian May, right, pictured in 1979The band were famous for always demanding the best, for spending more than anyone else on private jets, stretch limos, fleets of assistants, hairdressers, designer stage costumes and the rest.There were four-course backstage feasts with candelabras, orgiastic parties involving dwarves and bowls of cocaine and appearances by performance artists, like the man who lay naked under a pile of chopped liver and was ordered to make the meat twitch when people walked past.The band was formed in 1970, originating from a band called Smile which included May, then a student at Imperial College.A fan of the band was Farrokh Bulsara, a student at Ealing College, who joined as the vocalist and changed his name to Freddie Mercury.They had a number of bass players before settling on Deacon. Legend has it that he was the seventh one they auditioned.          Queen were, of course, shattered by Freddie Mercury\u0027s death in 1991, but since then, May (right) and Roger Taylor (centre left) have continued to record, tour and perform, both as solo artists and as Queen\u0027We were so over-the-top, we thought that because he was quiet, he would fit in with us without too much upheaval,\u0027 recalled Taylor. May agreed: \u0027He\u0027s very solid and no-nonsense. He\u0027s always got his feet firmly on the ground.\u0027Deacon grew up in Leicestershire, the eldest child of an insurance broker, Arthur, who died when John was 11.He had been encouraged by his father to take up music, and formed his own band at 14. Deacon was, like May, a technological pioneer.He has a first-class degree in electronics from Chelsea College, and used to build equipment for the band, his most famous creation being the \u0027Deacy Amp\u0027 amplifier.Worldwide fame came in the mid 70s, with Bohemian Rhapsody. Their touring was legendary and their studio albums were complex and expensive to make.Deacon was known to hang back on stage, and those who remember him from this time say he seemed cripplingly shy — although with a dry sense of humour.\u0027John is one of those guys who will say nothing and then he will crack a joke, something really near the knuckle, and you will think: \u0027Did I really hear that right?\u0027 says Jacky Smith, who runs the Queen International fan club. He and Freddie were particularly friendly and would hang out together between gigs.Manager Chris O\u0027Donnell says: \u0027Brian May and Roger Taylor, who were the real rockers in the band, would slip away to hang out at some club in town leaving Freddie and John behind. John gradually started leaving too, and Freddie would go off to prowl the gay clubs.\u0027           Deacon was known to hang back on stage, and those who remember him from this time say he seemed cripplingly shy — although with a dry sense of humour. Left to right: John Deacon, Freddie Mercury, Roger Taylor and Brian MayPhil Sutcliffe, author of Queen: The Ultimate Illustrated History of the Crown Kings of Rock, said: \u0027John Deacon was very much the silent bass player which is why these days he can go around practically incognito, which is just the way he likes it.\u0027He was always ambivalent about the attention.\u0027Queen was a very volatile partnership between three explosive personalities, and then you had John, who was the still point. He had his family early on, from 1975, and was very much a family man.\u0027Deacon married Veronica Tetzlaff, a pretty blonde Polish Catholic trainee teacher, in January 1975 when she was pregnant with their first son, Robert, and Queen were just tasting global fame. They went on to have four more sons and a daughter. May said in an interview last year that the band  out of control while recording in Munich in the early 1980s. In a book he said that the band were: \u0027Living in a fantasy world of vodka and barmaids.\u0027He added: \u0027We all lost our minds . . . we were all in a perilous place where our emotions were out of control.\u0027It manifested itself in way too much drinking, a certain amount of drugs, which I didn\u0027t share — but certainly an awful lot of vodka went through my body. We all fell to bits.          Their touring was legendary and their studio albums were complex and expensive to make\u0027We overreacted with each other at times. We all left the band at some point. The studio\u0027s a hard place for a band anyway, but in our case all four of us as writers had had worldwide hits. The lifestyle we led magnified that conflict.\u0027May said it ended with \u0027John disappearing to Bali and seeing God or whatever\u0027. He added: \u0027He could be very outgoing and very funny, but I think some of the stuff that happened in Munich gave him a lot of damage, and I think losing Freddie was very hard for him as well. He found that incredibly hard to process, to the point where actually playing with us made it more difficult.\u0027In a rare interview, Deacon said he found the band\u0027s hiatus in 1985 hard to cope with. \u0027I went spare, really, because we were doing so little. I got really bored and quite depressed.\u0027Queen reformed the following year and continued to dominate the charts, playing sell-out stadium tours for the next two years.In July 1986 they threw a famous party at the Roof Gardens in Kensington to celebrate a gig at Wembley. The serving staff were entirely naked apart from body paint.Mercury, tortured by his promiscuous homosexuality, arrived with former girlfriend Mary Austin — his lover Jim Hutton nowhere to be seen. Deacon was overcome by booze. Fan club boss Jacky, who was on the same table, says: \u0027At one point late into the night John just slipped quietly off his chair, and ended up underneath the table. After a while he came back again. That was very John, he liked a drink.\u0027But Mercury\u0027s failing health began to cast a shadow. In 1987, not long after that party, Mercury was diagnosed HIV positive. As his health failed, the band made one final album. Mercury died in November 1991, and the band members were devastated — none more so than Deacon.Robert Ahwai, a friend of Deacon\u0027s from college, recalls: \u0027Maybe he thought, \u0027Freddie was the band, so what\u0027s the point?\u0027          Mercury died in November 1991, and the band members were devastated — none more so than Deacon\u0027He suffered from depression after Freddie died and I am not sure he has ever come out of it.\u0027Deacon played with May and Taylor at the Freddie Mercury Tribute concert in April 1992 and again, in January 1997, to showcase the final Queen song No-one But You (Only The Good Die Young) — a tribute to Mercury. Since then, he\u0027s barely been seen in public.When the musical We Will Rock You opened, May admitted that Deacon had not been to see it — although I\u0027m told he has been spotted in the audience.Queen author Sutcliffe says: \u0027After Freddie died, John withdrew more and more. I think Brian May once said that they tell John everything they are doing, and take his silence as acquiescence. He is an enigma.\u0027Jacky Smith agrees. \u0027John just gave up after Freddie died. He and Freddie were opposites really, because John is so shy and he was the youngest in the band. Freddie took him under his wing and they were very close for all those years.\u0027Freddie drew the attention away, and without Freddie there, I don\u0027t think John could face any of it.\u0027There was a short-lived scandal when it emerged in 2002 that Deacon had been visiting a strip bar and formed a friendship with lap dancer Emma Shelley, with whom he was photographed in central London.Those who know John say the episode seems out of character, and are dubious about how far these proclivities went.One neighbour said this week: \u0027You are wasting your time if you are trying to find John. He does live there, but he doesn\u0027t talk, not to anyone.\u0027I haven\u0027t seen him in a long time, he is fine, just private. The last time I saw him was a few months ago, in the summer.\u0027In an interview with a fansite some years ago, Deacon said his hobbies were drinking tea and having children.These days John Deacon\u0027s great passion is said to be golf — hardly the soul of rock \u0027n\u0027 roll. A desire for anonymity seems to be a recurring theme.The barman who used to serve him at his local pub revealed that he\u0027d been warned by Deacon\u0027s wife Veronica who the musician was — and was told not to mention Queen.So what next? Maybe John Deacon will go to see the new film, in which he is played by American actor Joseph Mazzello.But if he does, you can bet he will do his best to slip into the local cinema as just another anonymous face in the crowd."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/27/06/51AD9A7100000578-6322735-A_glowing_Meghan_Markle_watched_the_Invictus_Games_wheelchair_ba-a-42_1540617030633.jpg","title":"Harry pregnant Meghan attend Invictus Games basketball match","story":"    All smiles: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle addressed the packed closing ceremony of the Invictus Games on Saturday night    Jubilant: The pair are pictured at the Invictus Games on Saturday night in their last engagement in Australia before heading to New Zealand on Sunday morning          Meghan addressed the buzzing crowd in the Qudos Bank Arena which can hold 21,000. Meghan said: \u0027During this year\u0027s games in Sydney, I\u0027ve witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors.\u0027  In a short speech to the 12,0000-strong crowd in the Qudos Bank Arena, Meghan thanked organisers and athletes for making the Games so special          The Duchess said: \u0027It is such an honour to be here tonight, celebrating all of you and supporting my husband in the Invictus Games which he founded four years ago.\u0027    Prince Harry took the stage to rapturous applause.

Your energy powered our competitors all week and you made these Games your own by creating a typically Aussie atmosphere.To the friends and families who got our competitors to the start line and applauded them all the way to the finish line, thank you. You are all part of one big Invictus family and none of us would be here without you.And to the competitors goes the biggest thanks of all. You have once again left us humbled and inspired by your example, by your determination, by your service and by your sense of humour.Last Saturday, I spoke about how you were part of the Invictus generation. Your choice to serve your nations places you alongside those storied generations that have come before you, that fought two world wars and then secured a world order built on freedom, democracy, and tolerance.And of course this choice to serve - this choice to put yourselves at risk for the benefit of others - is at the very heart of what I founded these Invictus Games to celebrate. I wanted your service to be recognised.But what we saw again this week is that Invictus is so much more. Your example goes beyond the military community. It is about more than just your inspiring stories of recovery from injury and illness.It is about your example of determination, of optimism, of strength, honour and friendship, or as the Aussies call it \u0027mateship\u0027, as a core value that has the power to inspire the world.When we saw Paul Guest and Edwin Vermetten support each other through Paul\u0027s struggle with Post Traumatic Stress on the tennis court in front of a large audience, we saw what mateship really looks like.When Jakub Tynka fought through excruciating leg pain for the final 20 minutes of his cycling event, and let the cheering crowd and his fellow competitors Benjamin and Cedric push him over the finish line, we saw the definition of strength.When you saw Hannah Stolberg crossing the finish line on a bike which belonged to a late fellow serviceman whose values she strives to emulate, you witnessed the real meaning of honour.

Meghan referenced his courage in her speechIn travelling to these military bases, I was given a very special glimpse into the lives of those who serve our countries. I was able to see the unshakeable bond between servicemen and women on the ground together, but at the same time to feel the palpable longing for family and friends while deployed. Once home, the need for that anchor of support from loved ones, especially given how much it accelerates recovery and rehailitation is immeasurable. I\u0027ve been reminded of those memories here.During this year\u0027s Games in Sydney, I have witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors, and I\u0027ve had the privilege of meeting several of these family and friends. The Novack family from Chicago is a prime example of this very thing. When their son, Ryan, suffered a severe injury leaving him paralysed from the waist down, doctors said he would never be able to walk again, but after speaking to his mum, Kerry, it was clear that it was through Ryan\u0027s strength of spirit and with the unwaivering support of his parents that he was able to prove all of those doctors wrong.Not only has Ryan competed in sailing, swimming and athletics this week, but when Harry and I saw him at the finish line of the sailing competition, he literally jumped into our boat, with dexterity and ease by the way, to give both of us a hug.Seeing Ryan\u0027s mum on the water that day, waving a flag to cheer him on was a moment I will never forget. The support system on the ground here in Invictus is something unlike any other because it\u0027s not just cheering on your own, but realising that by the end of this week, your own becomes everyone in the Invictus Family.It was, after all, only within 24 hours of meeting other families at the Games that another competitor\u0027s little girl was calling Kerry Aunty Kerry. This is what the Invictus Family is all about.On that note, I would like to invite everyone to please join me in a huge round of applause to thank all of the friends and family who have helped make these Games possible. Meghan turned heads in tuxedo-inspired Antonio Berardi halterneck in a green hue with a buttoned wrap detail around the waist that perfectly skimmed her growing baby bump.She accessorised with a crescent-shaped clutch bag and added a dazzling touch to the ensemble with statement earrings beneath her delicate chignon while Harry looked dapper in a light grey suit and white shirt.The couple earlier returned to Sydney just in time to watch the final day of the Games before heading to New Zealand for the last leg of their Commonwealth tour. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex  arrived at the wheelchair basketball final just after the match started at 2.10pm, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd. After the final whistle, pregnant Meghan went on court to give the Netherlands and USA players their medals and one cheeky Dutch player kissed her on the cheek.The bold move was technically a breach of protocol because the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with a neck bow (from the head only) - but informal Meghan touched the player on the shoulder and smiled as he kissed her. The Duchess was glowing in a $550 maroon crepe knit wrap top by Australian designer Scanlan Theodore. She wore a Remembrance Day poppy on her left side and paired the top with black tapered trousers and high heels.           A cheeky Dutch player gave Meghan a kiss on the cheek after the final whistle. According to Royal.uk the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with \u0027a neck bow (from the head only).

Instead of all sitting down to enjoy the same food, each has a completely different meal.Vicki is eating the quorn fillet and salad, her husband Damian is enjoying the spaghetti bolognaise, their eldest son Haydon, seven, is making light work of an omelette with potatoes, broccoli and sweetcorn, while three-year-old Adam happily chomps on pizza.\u0027Jack is my Prince Charming\u0027: Disney-obsessed bride, 28,...Revealed: The VERY clever tricks you didn\u0027t know you could...Share this articleThat\u0027s because, thanks to a combination of food allergies, diet preferences and plain old fussy eating, Vicki finds herself making three or four separate meals every single evening. And she\u0027s not alone. Recent research found that three-quarters of parents in the UK have to cook more than one dish for dinner because of their family\u0027s demands.Gone are the days, it seems, of the whole family sitting around the table eating the same food and the children not being able to leave the table until their plate is clean.Instead, it\u0027s been replaced by restaurant-style dining where mum is forced to cook a different dish for every family member.                            There is nothing that all of us eat - except chips. It\u0027s soul-destroying                         \u0027I\u0027m a vegetarian, whereas my husband likes to have meat or fish every evening,\u0027 explains Vicki, who is also gluten-intolerant.\u0027My son Haydon is allergic to all nuts and sesame, and tree fruits like apples, plums or cherries make his mouth itchy.\u0027And while Adam used to eat anything, over the past year he\u0027s started eating only very plain food – sausages, chicken or pizza and definitely no vegetables. He won\u0027t eat sauces, so I can\u0027t even hide vegetables in there.\u0027So every weekday when Vicki returns home at about 6pm after a day at work as an office and human resources manager, she first spends half an hour preparing two different meals for her children.  The Clarke family in Bristol all eat completely different meals at the same time at the day\u0027s endThen it\u0027s straight on to cooking meals for herself and Damian, a 44-year-old civil servant, which takes up to three quarters of an hour.\u0027There is nothing that all of us eat except chips,\u0027 says Vicki. \u0027I used to get frustrated but now I\u0027ve accepted it.\u0027Until a year ago, I\u0027d try to make something for all of us but only my husband would enjoy it. It was soul-destroying.\u0027So I accepted the situation and now try to make it as easy as possible on myself. And it\u0027s a joy not to be throwing away food they won\u0027t eat all the time.\u0027Every Monday – Vicki\u0027s day off from work – is spent preparing food for the week ahead. First is the supermarket shop: \u0027I don\u0027t really plan or write a list. I have a repertoire of recipes and I go around and buy an awful lot of stuff so I have everything.\u0027          Vicki spends more than an hour after work cooking four separate meals after returning homeShe spends an hour and a half shopping and scanning labels of new foods to see if they\u0027re gluten-, nut- or sesame-free.It will all be topped up by another couple of quick trips to the supermarket later in the week for things she\u0027s forgotten or run out of.Back home, she starts cooking a meal from scratch.\u0027It\u0027s the one weekday when I can. I try to cook four different versions of the same thing so at least it looks as if we\u0027re eating the same meal.\u0027If I choose a roast, my husband and Haydon will eat it all, I\u0027ll have some vegetables with tofu sausages and no gravy, as it contains flour, and all Adam will have is the Yorkshire pudding so I\u0027ll put some sausages with it and some carrot-and-potato waffles, which is the only way I can get veg into him.                            In my day, if you didn\u0027t eat dinner, you\u0027d go to bed hungry                         \u0027Thankfully he loves fruit.\u0027Organisation is key, and Vicki runs the house like clockwork.\u0027In the freezer I have a shelf for Adam\u0027s foods, another for my gluten-free foods, a third for Damian\u0027s meat and fish and a fourth for things like bread and vegetables so I can find it all easily,\u0027 she says.\u0027I\u0027ve also got a tin for Haydon\u0027s nut-free cakes and treats, a cupboard with healthy snacks for Adam as I\u0027m so conscious his diet is terrible, and a special gluten-free shelf.\u0027She and Damian have also just dug a vegetable patch in their garden to try to encourage their youngest to eat more after a successful experiment growing cherry tomatoes this year.But are they going too far in pandering to what many would regard as simply fussy eating?          Vicki keeps a cupboard of healthy snacks for Adam as she\u0027s so conscious his diet is terribleJust a generation or two ago, children would be made to eat whatever was put in front of them or face going to bed hungry.Nowadays, in our child-centric world, the tide seems to have turned firmly in their favour.Add to that the ever-increasing cheapness, availability and convenience of food coupled with a lack of time and it\u0027s perhaps no wonder mothers feel under pressure to give their little darlings what they want.The problem is so acute that recent research discovered that half of all family members follow a specialist diet – and a third of all meals regularly go in the bin.It\u0027s a situation mother-of-four Keri Harrison understands well.          That\u0027s because, thanks to a combination of food allergies, diet preferences and plain old fussy eating, Vicki finds herself making three or four separate meals every single eveningHer eldest son Kyle, 16, is a faddy eater – he loves strong flavours and won\u0027t eat spaghetti or baked potatoes. Her middle son Bradley, 13, won\u0027t look at vegetables.Meanwhile, daughter Milli, ten, will only eat the same dish for weeks on end before switching to another. So far baby Wester, eight months, will eat anything.\u0027I\u0027ve tried and tested the \u0027they won\u0027t starve themselves\u0027 theory,\u0027 says Keri, from Ipswich.\u0027Again and again I\u0027ve put something on the table and said to them \u0027Eat this or you\u0027ll go hungry\u0027 but they will go to bed without having eaten anything. As a mum, that\u0027s worrying. And I can\u0027t afford to waste food.\u0027So every night she spends 90 minutes cooking four or five different dishes for her family. \u0027At the moment the only meal the entire family will eat is shepherd\u0027s pie – that\u0027s what Milli\u0027s eating at the moment. But I can\u0027t do that every night.\u0027I\u0027d love to enjoy cooking for my family but I dread it sometimes. It would be so lovely to hear \u0027that\u0027s lovely\u0027 rather than \u0027I don\u0027t like that\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s got to the point now where I\u0027m on autopilot – I know exactly what I\u0027m buying during my two-hour weekly shop but the moment I get home from the morning school run, I think, \u0027Now, what am I doing for dinner tonight?\u0027 I have to picture them mentally sitting around the table and write down what each is having so I can remember.\u0027On a typical day, she\u0027ll bake a shepherd\u0027s pie for Milli, vegetables for the baby, a curry for Kyle and a pizza for Bradley. Keri and husband Justin will enjoy barbecue chicken. \u0027I start cooking at about 3.30pm but the menu can all change when they get home from school and they say, \u0027I don\u0027t want that.\u0027 \u0027Research by Abbott Healthcare in 2014 found that 83 per cent of parents have children who are fussy eaters. So are they simply being silly and obstinate, or is there something more to it? The latter, argues psychologist Dr Gillian Harris, author of Food Refusal And Avoidant Eating In Children. \u0027Some children are fussier than others and that is genetically determined,\u0027 she says. \u0027It\u0027s linked to hyper-sensitivity. For example, if a child is worried about touching sticky foods, they\u0027re more hyper-sensitive and therefore more likely to be fussy eaters in childhood.\u0027This fussiness tends to kick in at about the age of two. \u0027At this stage it can be tricky to introduce new foods because they will start to refuse food that doesn\u0027t look the same as things they\u0027ve eaten before,\u0027 she says.\u0027We think that\u0027s because children become mobile at this stage and, in primitive times, children were taught not to eat something that doesn\u0027t look exactly the same as what they know.\u0027So if you don\u0027t get tastes and textures into their diet quickly enough, you lose the window of opportunity.\u0027Dr Harris advises parents not to worry if you have a mildly fussy child. It\u0027s only when they won\u0027t eat more than a handful of foods that you should seek help.\u0027Most will grow out of it,\u0027 she says.So how do you encourage a fussy eater to be… well, less so? Nutritionist Michelle Lake agrees that eating together as a family is important.\u0027Parents can set an example by eating a wide variety of different foods,\u0027 she says.Michelle recommends reward charts for when children eat their vegetables, and not letting them eat between meals.Of course, if family members have allergies, it\u0027s a different story, as the tragic death of 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died after eating a Pret a Manger sandwich, showed recently.And the number of children with allergies is on the rise. Since 1990, the figure has increased by 500 per cent – with six to eight per cent of children now thought to be affected.Nut, milk and egg allergies are the most common.Sarah Matthews\u0027s family in the West Midlands is typical.The 35-year-old teacher is both lactose- and gluten-intolerant, and because of this her 16-month-old baby Seren is also dairy-free.Her partner Steve, a 44-year- old teacher, has fibromyalgia and digestive issues so has to eat a very natural diet with no processed or sugary and salted foods, while eight-year-old son Seth is plain old fussy.He won\u0027t eat most vegetables, any meat or fish with skin or fat, or fruit containing seeds.Consequently, Sarah can find herself spending two hours every day cooking four different suppers for them to eat.\u0027I used to get frustrated,\u0027 she admits. \u0027I\u0027m from a time when you sat down and if you didn\u0027t eat your dinner you didn\u0027t get anything else, so this was a shock.\u0027But whenever I think \u0027Why do I do this?\u0027, I look at my family smiling happily around the dinner table and know it\u0027s worth it.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/28/00/51B59DA400000578-6324777-image-a-46_1540681918970.jpg","title":"Prince Harry Meghan Markle wave leaving New Zealand royal tour continues","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wrapped up their royal tour in Australia on Sunday and are headed to New Zealand aboard a flight with the nation\u0027s Invictus teamPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have ended their royal tour of Australia, and flew to New Zealand on Sunday morning.The pair arrived at Sydney Airport with Invictus Games competitors from New Zealand before jetting off for the last leg of their tour about 10am.The couple held hands as they boarded the plane, with Harry leading his wife up the stairs, where they turned and gave a very short wave before disappearing inside. The New Zealand team are on the flight with the royal couple. When they land at Wellington about 3pm local time, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be greeted with a Haka and a 21-gun salute.  With Australian beaches and Pacific climates behind them, Prince Harry and Meghan can expect nippier weather when they touch down on Sunday.While Harry has previously visited the Shaky Isles, the last time in 2015, it might be the Duchess who has already seen more of the nation after her campervan road trip across the country in 2014.

Her other companion is Anglo-Asian police officer Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill).In last Sunday’s episode, the Doctor and her companions travelled back in time to the moment black bus passenger Rosa Parks ignited the US civil rights movement.          For some viewers, Jodie Whittaker’s debut series as the Time Lord has become a tiresome ordeal of political correctnessOne fan wrote: ‘There should be a clever story line, not a rehash of history. There’s also an underlying feeling the focus has been forcing inclusiveness by having such obviously erse characters.’Another said: ‘Please keep the PC stuff for documentaries and serious drama and let the Doctor help us escape to a fantasy world.’Similar criticism is likely to follow an upcoming episode called Demons Of The Punjab, set during the Partition of India in 1947.But Frazer Hines, who played the Doctor’s companion Jamie McCrimmon between 1966 and 1969, said: ‘I was a bit worried about the Rosa Parks episode because race is obviously a sensitive issue, but I thought it was very well done.’  First, we had the Rosa Parks race relations plot... Last week’s storyline – in which the Doctor and her companions come to the rescue of heroic civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks in Alabama in 1955 – may have been ideal for Black History Month but its heavy-handed message led one fan to dub it the ‘racism-is-bad episode’.           The Doctor and her companions come to the rescue of heroic civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks in Alabama in 1955Next, we\u0027ll be told we did bad things in IndiaThe political education in the Rosa Parks episode will continue in the upcoming Demons Of The Punjab – set during the Partition of India in 1947 and guest-starring Shane Zaza (Happy Valley). It’s likely to show the evil consequences of the British Empire and colonialism, as the Doctor’s companion Yasmin goes back in time to search for her grandmother.            The political education in the Rosa Parks episode will continue in the upcoming Demons Of The Punjab, set in India in 1947The Doctor is too busy preaching to fight any aliens...In the opening episode, the Doctor pleads with psychotic alien Tzim-Sha – his face encrusted with the teeth of his victims – to look deep inside himself and leave his murderous ways behind. Unsurprisingly, the preachy approach doesn’t work and the Time Lord is forced to resort to more drastic action.

If you’re using a cash, ticket or oyster machine, be wary of who is around you and make sure your pin is covered.6. Thieves often work in groups, so try not be distracted by commotion or attention which could be a ploy.7. Finally, check whether your home insurance policy includes away from home cover so if the worst does happen, you at least know you are covered financially.

Founding Father of the United States Benjamin Franklin first had the idea to change the clocks while he was in Paris in 1784He was also a keen golfer and would become rather annoyed when it got too dark for him to continue playing in the evening.Sadly he died in 1915, a year before it was introduced in the UK.When the clocks go back tonight, Britain will go back to Greenwich Mean Time. However, night workers may have to work an extra hour, and those working on Sunday morning may get confused with the time."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/27/06/51AD9A7100000578-6322735-A_glowing_Meghan_Markle_watched_the_Invictus_Games_wheelchair_ba-a-42_1540617030633.jpg","title":"Harry pregnant Meghan attend Invictus Games basketball match","story":"    All smiles: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle addressed the packed closing ceremony of the Invictus Games on Saturday night    Jubilant: The pair are pictured at the Invictus Games on Saturday night in their last engagement in Australia before heading to New Zealand on Sunday morning          Meghan addressed the buzzing crowd in the Qudos Bank Arena which can hold 21,000. Meghan said: \u0027During this year\u0027s games in Sydney, I\u0027ve witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors.\u0027  In a short speech to the 12,0000-strong crowd in the Qudos Bank Arena, Meghan thanked organisers and athletes for making the Games so special          The Duchess said: \u0027It is such an honour to be here tonight, celebrating all of you and supporting my husband in the Invictus Games which he founded four years ago.\u0027    Prince Harry took the stage to rapturous applause.

The choir sang at the Invictus closing ceremony          As always when these Games close, I would like to start by saying thank you.To PK and Lieutenant General Peter Lay and the whole Sydney 2018 team - the vision and hard work has paid off and you have put on a truly magnificent Invictus Games.Thank you for being our partners over the last couple of years, and our team at the Invictus Games Foundation, especially Dominic Reid and Rose Hall, for their tireless efforts and hard work.To the people of Australia who filled the stands and cheered on the sidelines - thank you so much. Your energy powered our competitors all week and you made these Games your own by creating a typically Aussie atmosphere.To the friends and families who got our competitors to the start line and applauded them all the way to the finish line, thank you. You are all part of one big Invictus family and none of us would be here without you.And to the competitors goes the biggest thanks of all. You have once again left us humbled and inspired by your example, by your determination, by your service and by your sense of humour.Last Saturday, I spoke about how you were part of the Invictus generation. Your choice to serve your nations places you alongside those storied generations that have come before you, that fought two world wars and then secured a world order built on freedom, democracy, and tolerance.And of course this choice to serve - this choice to put yourselves at risk for the benefit of others - is at the very heart of what I founded these Invictus Games to celebrate. I wanted your service to be recognised.But what we saw again this week is that Invictus is so much more. Your example goes beyond the military community. It is about more than just your inspiring stories of recovery from injury and illness.It is about your example of determination, of optimism, of strength, honour and friendship, or as the Aussies call it \u0027mateship\u0027, as a core value that has the power to inspire the world.When we saw Paul Guest and Edwin Vermetten support each other through Paul\u0027s struggle with Post Traumatic Stress on the tennis court in front of a large audience, we saw what mateship really looks like.When Jakub Tynka fought through excruciating leg pain for the final 20 minutes of his cycling event, and let the cheering crowd and his fellow competitors Benjamin and Cedric push him over the finish line, we saw the definition of strength.When you saw Hannah Stolberg crossing the finish line on a bike which belonged to a late fellow serviceman whose values she strives to emulate, you witnessed the real meaning of honour.

She is pictured putting on  parachute with the US Army in Italy          Meghan Markle shakes hands with a group of sailors and gets a tour of the USS Ross in Spain when she visited bases while working on Suits  Ryan Patrick Novack of the United States competes in the Mens 400m in Sydney. Meghan referenced his courage in her speechIn travelling to these military bases, I was given a very special glimpse into the lives of those who serve our countries. I was able to see the unshakeable bond between servicemen and women on the ground together, but at the same time to feel the palpable longing for family and friends while deployed. Once home, the need for that anchor of support from loved ones, especially given how much it accelerates recovery and rehailitation is immeasurable. I\u0027ve been reminded of those memories here.During this year\u0027s Games in Sydney, I have witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors, and I\u0027ve had the privilege of meeting several of these family and friends. The Novack family from Chicago is a prime example of this very thing. When their son, Ryan, suffered a severe injury leaving him paralysed from the waist down, doctors said he would never be able to walk again, but after speaking to his mum, Kerry, it was clear that it was through Ryan\u0027s strength of spirit and with the unwaivering support of his parents that he was able to prove all of those doctors wrong.Not only has Ryan competed in sailing, swimming and athletics this week, but when Harry and I saw him at the finish line of the sailing competition, he literally jumped into our boat, with dexterity and ease by the way, to give both of us a hug.Seeing Ryan\u0027s mum on the water that day, waving a flag to cheer him on was a moment I will never forget. The support system on the ground here in Invictus is something unlike any other because it\u0027s not just cheering on your own, but realising that by the end of this week, your own becomes everyone in the Invictus Family.It was, after all, only within 24 hours of meeting other families at the Games that another competitor\u0027s little girl was calling Kerry Aunty Kerry. This is what the Invictus Family is all about.On that note, I would like to invite everyone to please join me in a huge round of applause to thank all of the friends and family who have helped make these Games possible. Meghan turned heads in tuxedo-inspired Antonio Berardi halterneck in a green hue with a buttoned wrap detail around the waist that perfectly skimmed her growing baby bump.She accessorised with a crescent-shaped clutch bag and added a dazzling touch to the ensemble with statement earrings beneath her delicate chignon while Harry looked dapper in a light grey suit and white shirt.The couple earlier returned to Sydney just in time to watch the final day of the Games before heading to New Zealand for the last leg of their Commonwealth tour. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex  arrived at the wheelchair basketball final just after the match started at 2.10pm, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd. After the final whistle, pregnant Meghan went on court to give the Netherlands and USA players their medals and one cheeky Dutch player kissed her on the cheek.The bold move was technically a breach of protocol because the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with a neck bow (from the head only) - but informal Meghan touched the player on the shoulder and smiled as he kissed her. The Duchess was glowing in a $550 maroon crepe knit wrap top by Australian designer Scanlan Theodore. She wore a Remembrance Day poppy on her left side and paired the top with black tapered trousers and high heels.           A cheeky Dutch player gave Meghan a kiss on the cheek after the final whistle. According to Royal.uk the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with \u0027a neck bow (from the head only).

Vermetten (pictured) described how he used the popular anthem Let It Go as a way to help Guest repress the memories that were flooding back. \u0027I took him by the face and said, Look at me. We are a team so let it go,\u0027\u0027\u0027 Vermetten said, according to the Invictus Games website  The touching moment when Invictus Games competitor Edwin Vermetten (right) comforted fellow veteran Paul Guest (left) after a helicopter flew overhead left spectators in tears\u0027Last Saturday, I spoke about how you were part of the Invictus generation. Your choice to serve your nations places you alongside those storied generations that have come before you, that fought two world wars and then secured a world order built on freedom, democracy, and tolerance.\u0027And of course this choice to serve - this choice to put yourselves at risk for the benefit of others - is at the very heart of what I founded these Invictus Games to celebrate. I wanted your service to be recognised.\u0027But what we saw again this week is that Invictus is so much more. Your example goes beyond the military community. It is about more than just your inspiring stories of recovery from injury and illness.\u0027It is about your example of determination, of optimism, of strength, honour and friendship, or as the Aussies call it \u0027mateship\u0027, as a core value that has the power to inspire the world.    Harry and Meghan at the closing ceremony. The Duke said in his speech: \u0027The secret to the success of these Games has been accepting that mental health is the real key to recovery\u0027\u0027Asking for help is courageous. It will improve your life and the lives of those around you immeasurably. In the moment you admit that you are struggling, you take that first step towards a better future for you and your friends and your family. \u0027You allow those around you to show you the love and concern that is central to the cure.\u0027I\u0027ve been there, you\u0027ve been there, and we now need to reach out to those who can never even imagine themselves in that place.\u0027I hope the ethos of these Games has also shown you that we all have mental health, just as much as we all have physical health. I hope you have seen that our mental fitness is even more important than our physical fitness, because without it, we cannot survive, let alone thrive.\u0027So for all the civvies, or civilians out there, look at what these men and women have achieved and know that one day, though you may not be injured in combat, physical or emotional injuries can happen to any one of us, on any given day.\u0027The secret of these Invictus Games is not really about the amazing medical science that has saved the lives of our competitors and helped many of them to walk, swim, or move again.\u0027The secret to the success of these Games has been accepting that mental health is the real key to recovery. Our competitors have helped turn the issue of mental health from a sad story to an inspiring one. They want to live, rather than just be alive.\u0027When you accept a challenge is real, you can have hope. When you understand your vulnerability, you can become strong. When you are brave enough to ask for help, you can be lifted up. You can start living, doing, feeling - not simply surviving.\u0027And when you share your story, you can change the world. And I can\u0027t think of a better way to continue serving your country.\u0027I am so proud to call you my friends and my Invictus family. You are the Invictus generation and you are showing us all that anything is possible.\u0027Thank you to everyone for an amazing Sydney Games - we\u0027ll see you in the Netherlands in 2020.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/26/08/1A64E51600000514-6319381-The_couple_s_daughter_Chloe_centre_is_also_often_in_the_limeligh-a-30_1540540278124.jpg","title":"Sir Philip Green works sweat plays tennis sweltering heat","story":"Sir Philip Green playing tennis just moments before he was confronted by journalists yesterday at the Canyon Ranch resort in Arizona  Sir Philip smiled as he walked around court with a towel draped over his shoulders          Taking a break: The Topshop tycoon sips from a flask as he plays in the sweltering heat          The billionaire quickly sped away after being approached by journalists at the tennis courtsLord Hain said: \u0027I stand resolutely by what I\u0027ve said and neither retract nor apologise for standing up for human rights.\u0027He added: \u0027I always comply fully with my House of Lords obligations as I did on that occasion.

It has nine bedrooms and a swimming pool and looks onto Willow Canyon and the grounds of the stunning Santa Catalina nature reserve. In an interview in 2010, Sir Philip said of his stay at Canyon Ranch: \u0027To have time, space. It was spectacular. There were blue skies, you\u0027re walking and see mountains.\u0027I had time to think in an open space and was in a completely different zone.

Dad Damian (left) is a meat lover, Haydon, seven, (second from left) is allergic to nuts and sesame and Adam, three, (right) hates all vegetables But there\u0027s something unusual about this family dinner. Instead of all sitting down to enjoy the same food, each has a completely different meal.Vicki is eating the quorn fillet and salad, her husband Damian is enjoying the spaghetti bolognaise, their eldest son Haydon, seven, is making light work of an omelette with potatoes, broccoli and sweetcorn, while three-year-old Adam happily chomps on pizza.\u0027Jack is my Prince Charming\u0027: Disney-obsessed bride, 28,...Revealed: The VERY clever tricks you didn\u0027t know you could...Share this articleThat\u0027s because, thanks to a combination of food allergies, diet preferences and plain old fussy eating, Vicki finds herself making three or four separate meals every single evening. And she\u0027s not alone. Recent research found that three-quarters of parents in the UK have to cook more than one dish for dinner because of their family\u0027s demands.Gone are the days, it seems, of the whole family sitting around the table eating the same food and the children not being able to leave the table until their plate is clean.Instead, it\u0027s been replaced by restaurant-style dining where mum is forced to cook a different dish for every family member.                            There is nothing that all of us eat - except chips. It\u0027s soul-destroying                         \u0027I\u0027m a vegetarian, whereas my husband likes to have meat or fish every evening,\u0027 explains Vicki, who is also gluten-intolerant.\u0027My son Haydon is allergic to all nuts and sesame, and tree fruits like apples, plums or cherries make his mouth itchy.\u0027And while Adam used to eat anything, over the past year he\u0027s started eating only very plain food – sausages, chicken or pizza and definitely no vegetables. He won\u0027t eat sauces, so I can\u0027t even hide vegetables in there.\u0027So every weekday when Vicki returns home at about 6pm after a day at work as an office and human resources manager, she first spends half an hour preparing two different meals for her children.  The Clarke family in Bristol all eat completely different meals at the same time at the day\u0027s endThen it\u0027s straight on to cooking meals for herself and Damian, a 44-year-old civil servant, which takes up to three quarters of an hour.\u0027There is nothing that all of us eat except chips,\u0027 says Vicki. \u0027I used to get frustrated but now I\u0027ve accepted it.\u0027Until a year ago, I\u0027d try to make something for all of us but only my husband would enjoy it. It was soul-destroying.\u0027So I accepted the situation and now try to make it as easy as possible on myself. And it\u0027s a joy not to be throwing away food they won\u0027t eat all the time.\u0027Every Monday – Vicki\u0027s day off from work – is spent preparing food for the week ahead. First is the supermarket shop: \u0027I don\u0027t really plan or write a list. I have a repertoire of recipes and I go around and buy an awful lot of stuff so I have everything.\u0027          Vicki spends more than an hour after work cooking four separate meals after returning homeShe spends an hour and a half shopping and scanning labels of new foods to see if they\u0027re gluten-, nut- or sesame-free.It will all be topped up by another couple of quick trips to the supermarket later in the week for things she\u0027s forgotten or run out of.Back home, she starts cooking a meal from scratch.\u0027It\u0027s the one weekday when I can. I try to cook four different versions of the same thing so at least it looks as if we\u0027re eating the same meal.\u0027If I choose a roast, my husband and Haydon will eat it all, I\u0027ll have some vegetables with tofu sausages and no gravy, as it contains flour, and all Adam will have is the Yorkshire pudding so I\u0027ll put some sausages with it and some carrot-and-potato waffles, which is the only way I can get veg into him.                            In my day, if you didn\u0027t eat dinner, you\u0027d go to bed hungry                         \u0027Thankfully he loves fruit.\u0027Organisation is key, and Vicki runs the house like clockwork.\u0027In the freezer I have a shelf for Adam\u0027s foods, another for my gluten-free foods, a third for Damian\u0027s meat and fish and a fourth for things like bread and vegetables so I can find it all easily,\u0027 she says.\u0027I\u0027ve also got a tin for Haydon\u0027s nut-free cakes and treats, a cupboard with healthy snacks for Adam as I\u0027m so conscious his diet is terrible, and a special gluten-free shelf.\u0027She and Damian have also just dug a vegetable patch in their garden to try to encourage their youngest to eat more after a successful experiment growing cherry tomatoes this year.But are they going too far in pandering to what many would regard as simply fussy eating?          Vicki keeps a cupboard of healthy snacks for Adam as she\u0027s so conscious his diet is terribleJust a generation or two ago, children would be made to eat whatever was put in front of them or face going to bed hungry.Nowadays, in our child-centric world, the tide seems to have turned firmly in their favour.Add to that the ever-increasing cheapness, availability and convenience of food coupled with a lack of time and it\u0027s perhaps no wonder mothers feel under pressure to give their little darlings what they want.The problem is so acute that recent research discovered that half of all family members follow a specialist diet – and a third of all meals regularly go in the bin.It\u0027s a situation mother-of-four Keri Harrison understands well.          That\u0027s because, thanks to a combination of food allergies, diet preferences and plain old fussy eating, Vicki finds herself making three or four separate meals every single eveningHer eldest son Kyle, 16, is a faddy eater – he loves strong flavours and won\u0027t eat spaghetti or baked potatoes. Her middle son Bradley, 13, won\u0027t look at vegetables.Meanwhile, daughter Milli, ten, will only eat the same dish for weeks on end before switching to another. So far baby Wester, eight months, will eat anything.\u0027I\u0027ve tried and tested the \u0027they won\u0027t starve themselves\u0027 theory,\u0027 says Keri, from Ipswich.\u0027Again and again I\u0027ve put something on the table and said to them \u0027Eat this or you\u0027ll go hungry\u0027 but they will go to bed without having eaten anything. As a mum, that\u0027s worrying. And I can\u0027t afford to waste food.\u0027So every night she spends 90 minutes cooking four or five different dishes for her family. \u0027At the moment the only meal the entire family will eat is shepherd\u0027s pie – that\u0027s what Milli\u0027s eating at the moment. But I can\u0027t do that every night.\u0027I\u0027d love to enjoy cooking for my family but I dread it sometimes. It would be so lovely to hear \u0027that\u0027s lovely\u0027 rather than \u0027I don\u0027t like that\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s got to the point now where I\u0027m on autopilot – I know exactly what I\u0027m buying during my two-hour weekly shop but the moment I get home from the morning school run, I think, \u0027Now, what am I doing for dinner tonight?\u0027 I have to picture them mentally sitting around the table and write down what each is having so I can remember.\u0027On a typical day, she\u0027ll bake a shepherd\u0027s pie for Milli, vegetables for the baby, a curry for Kyle and a pizza for Bradley. Keri and husband Justin will enjoy barbecue chicken. \u0027I start cooking at about 3.30pm but the menu can all change when they get home from school and they say, \u0027I don\u0027t want that.\u0027 \u0027Research by Abbott Healthcare in 2014 found that 83 per cent of parents have children who are fussy eaters. So are they simply being silly and obstinate, or is there something more to it? The latter, argues psychologist Dr Gillian Harris, author of Food Refusal And Avoidant Eating In Children. \u0027Some children are fussier than others and that is genetically determined,\u0027 she says. \u0027It\u0027s linked to hyper-sensitivity. For example, if a child is worried about touching sticky foods, they\u0027re more hyper-sensitive and therefore more likely to be fussy eaters in childhood.\u0027This fussiness tends to kick in at about the age of two. \u0027At this stage it can be tricky to introduce new foods because they will start to refuse food that doesn\u0027t look the same as things they\u0027ve eaten before,\u0027 she says.\u0027We think that\u0027s because children become mobile at this stage and, in primitive times, children were taught not to eat something that doesn\u0027t look exactly the same as what they know.\u0027So if you don\u0027t get tastes and textures into their diet quickly enough, you lose the window of opportunity.\u0027Dr Harris advises parents not to worry if you have a mildly fussy child. It\u0027s only when they won\u0027t eat more than a handful of foods that you should seek help.\u0027Most will grow out of it,\u0027 she says.So how do you encourage a fussy eater to be… well, less so? Nutritionist Michelle Lake agrees that eating together as a family is important.\u0027Parents can set an example by eating a wide variety of different foods,\u0027 she says.Michelle recommends reward charts for when children eat their vegetables, and not letting them eat between meals.Of course, if family members have allergies, it\u0027s a different story, as the tragic death of 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died after eating a Pret a Manger sandwich, showed recently.And the number of children with allergies is on the rise. Since 1990, the figure has increased by 500 per cent – with six to eight per cent of children now thought to be affected.Nut, milk and egg allergies are the most common.Sarah Matthews\u0027s family in the West Midlands is typical.The 35-year-old teacher is both lactose- and gluten-intolerant, and because of this her 16-month-old baby Seren is also dairy-free.Her partner Steve, a 44-year- old teacher, has fibromyalgia and digestive issues so has to eat a very natural diet with no processed or sugary and salted foods, while eight-year-old son Seth is plain old fussy.He won\u0027t eat most vegetables, any meat or fish with skin or fat, or fruit containing seeds.Consequently, Sarah can find herself spending two hours every day cooking four different suppers for them to eat.\u0027I used to get frustrated,\u0027 she admits. \u0027I\u0027m from a time when you sat down and if you didn\u0027t eat your dinner you didn\u0027t get anything else, so this was a shock.\u0027But whenever I think \u0027Why do I do this?\u0027, I look at my family smiling happily around the dinner table and know it\u0027s worth it.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Kate Moss refuse speak Sir Philip Green furore asks LIZ JONES","story":"    Sir Philip Green could be loyal.

So the British fashion industry\u0027s deafening silence since Thursday has been shocking – but entirely predictable. For as one glossy magazine editor tells me: \u0027We all feed from the same trough.\u0027On Friday a former Topshop buyer, whom I first met in Bangladesh at a garment factory after she\u0027d left his brand, called me to say she\u0027d read an article in the Telegraph by a socialite who says she was fondled by Green at a party, while he chatted to her boyfriend. He\u0027d put his hand up the back of her skirt – apparently getting a kick from both her boyfriend\u0027s ignorance and her powerlessness to stop him.\u0027Why did no one challenge him sooner,\u0027 the buyer asked me. \u0027Who\u0027s to say a hand cupping a buttock is worse than being shouted at while you\u0027re on the phone to a supplier in the Far East – yelling that you must make them drop their prices.\u0027It got to the point I felt sick every Sunday night at the prospect of going to work.

So the British fashion industry\u0027s deafening silence since Thursday has been shocking – but entirely predictablePhilip Green has bullied me since I conducted my first interview with him for the London Evening Standard, in November 2005. I met him in his boardroom at Arcadia HQ on Berners Street with its view of the London Eye before his chauffeur and bodyguard, Kevin, drove us to the Royal Academy, where his brands – Topshop, Evans, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Burton – were showing their wares to the press. In the limo, he chain-smoked Philip Morris – \u0027I have to have one pleasure in life\u0027 – and slagged off every designer store we passed. \u0027Stella McCartney? Never made two bob.\u0027 When I asked about his employees, his reputation as a rottweiler, he told me: \u0027I give a straight yes or no. They are empowered.\u0027He introduced me to his wife, Tina (who owns 92 per cent of Arcadia shares) and 14-year-old daughter, Chloe. When I later wrote that Chloe was wearing mukluk boots, which are made of fur, something banned in his stores, he complained to my editor, a soignee woman who that morning had no need of a blow dry.But he could be loyal.

He called me, swearing, and told me I was \u0027anti-Semitic\u0027. \u0027No,\u0027 I said. \u0027These girls don\u0027t have much money. You were grooming them.\u0027 As, over the years, I refused to fawn over him, his mood swung between extremes. After I wrote a rave review of one collection, he sent me a gorgeous olive greatcoat, still warm from the model who\u0027d worn it. Later, after a bad review, his right-hand woman called me. \u0027He wants his coat back.\u0027The last time I spoke to Green was at an Evans show in the autumn of 2014. He\u0027d sat me front row of this plus-size show (now that\u0027s a laugh in Oliver Shah\u0027s biography, he is reported to have told a female buyer: \u0027You\u0027re absolutely f****** useless. I should throw you out the window but you\u0027re so fat you\u0027d probably bounce back in again\u0027), as I\u0027d been at the vanguard of a campaign to give big women the fashion they deserve. Afterwards he asked if we could pose together for the paparazzi. I said no. Unlike every female glossy editor in the land, I felt to do so would betray my readers. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to stand next to him, gurning.          I can\u0027t help but remember the image, at his show inside the old Eurostar terminal in Waterloo, of American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, looking like the cat who got the zero fat cream because Green had arranged for her own personal escalator on which to glide in, and glide out (when approached for this story, her silence was deafening). Above, at Tate Britain in 2016Everyone in fashion knew he was a tyrant, but it\u0027s unreasonable to expect teenage models and junior employees to stand up to him you might wonder why anyone would sign a gagging order, but this was a seriously powerful man.So it was the responsibility of the senior company executives, editors, publishing directors and model agents to be on the side of the women who toil in low-paid jobs in stores and factories and lap up glossy fashion magazines.I can\u0027t help but remember the image, at his show inside the old Eurostar terminal in Waterloo, of American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, looking like the cat who got the zero fat cream because Green had arranged for her own personal escalator on which to glide in, and glide out (when approached for this story, her silence was deafening).I can\u0027t help but think back to the meetings of magazine editors and London Fashion Week bigwigs in the boardroom of Vogue House, where not one woman had the courage to say, \u0027What can we do about Philip Green?\u0027Or, later, as the BHS scandal erupted and the pension hole gaped, why even then did not one of them take him to task over the number of employees his greed was condemning to penury?My guess? They were too busy counting his advertising spend, and nursing their 40 per cent Topshop discount card.Even today, when I ask Caroline Rush CBE, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, who will have had more dealings with Green than most, if she ever took him to task, I\u0027m told her PA is away on honeymoon. I email the British Fashion Council press office and ask them to call her on her mobile. How bad is this for British fashion? Will he show next season? She doesn\u0027t ring back. It is her job to reply. This is what she is paid to do.Or Baroness Karren Brady CBE (don\u0027t you love all these titles?), who has been vocal about fighting sexism in business, and has been chair of Arcadia\u0027s parent company, Taveta, for eight years.I ask if she knew of allegations that Green gave female staff \u0027lingering hugs\u0027 and asked if they wanted their \u0027bottoms slapped\u0027 or, indeed, had paid substantial sums to settle complaints. Only her PA gets back to me: \u0027Karren is away until next week.\u0027 But this is important! She\u0027s got a phone, hasn\u0027t she? I visit her glorious villa next to Harrods no one answers the door.How about Naomi Campbell, who publicly attacked former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman – now a Mail on Sunday columnist – for having too many white staff? Did Naomi ever find Green racist? No reply.How about Kate Moss? Would she like to offer her support to him, given he\u0027d been so loyal to her in the past? She was \u0027about to get on a plane\u0027, apparently.Or Edward Enninful OBE, new super-erse editor of UK Vogue? No reply.Come on, then, Natalie Massenet, Net-a-Porter founder and one-time chair of the British Fashion Council? She can\u0027t be scared of anyone. She\u0027s a bleeding Dame! I get an email. \u0027Natalie is going to reach out to you.\u0027 I\u0027m still waiting.Isn\u0027t it telling that the only powerful person in British fashion I can find who is willing to speak out about Green is a man – although he doesn\u0027t want me to use his name.No longer employed by Topshop, he tells me: \u0027He\u0027s outrageous. This is all typical of him. Doing it in the first place is unacceptable, covering it up is ridiculous.\u0027Is he a sexual predator, a racist? \u0027The real issue is this: he will never be aware that he has done anything wrong. He just doesn\u0027t get it, he will never change.\u0027Is that why he left Green\u0027s company? \u0027I left because I didn\u0027t like the way he treated people. My mum told me that we are all equal, and that we should treat everyone with respect. He didn\u0027t treat anyone with respect.\u0027I will leave the last word to a young woman braver than all the highly paid fashion mavens named above.Annabelle is the daughter of Tony Brown, owner of Beales department store in Bournemouth, once retail director at BHS under Green.She is 21 years old. \u0027I\u0027m honestly glad the world is seeing what a vile, slimy man Philip Green is.\u0027I\u0027ve known him since I was a young child and I\u0027ve seen first-hand how he can be.

Her distraught mother said she had become depressed as a result of her treatment by the RSPCA.Mr Sherwood, who was appointed in August, said: ‘I am deeply troubled by the findings and take them extremely seriously. There is absolutely no place for bullying of any nature within the RSPCA.‘The wellbeing of our employees and volunteers is of utmost importance to us because, without their passion and commitment, we will not be able to deliver our goal of creating a world that is kinder to animals.’Mr Sherwood added that the charity, which had an income of more than £140 million last year, had recruited a director of people and culture to look at ‘all aspects of staff wellbeing’.Anne Kasica, who runs the Self Help Group (SHG) for people who have experienced unfair treatment at the hands of the RSPCA, said the poll’s findings came as ‘no surprise’.The Unite survey also found 62.5 per cent of staff had experienced five or more ‘negative behaviours’ in the past year.These included having their views and opinions ignored, being told to take on tasks beyond their level of competence, having staff performance details withheld, and being set impossible deadlines.Among administrative staff, more than 90 per cent had experienced one negative behaviour, rising to almost 97 per cent among inspectors.Siobhan Endean, Unite’s national officer for the charity sector, welcomed Mr Sherwood’s commitment to tackling the culture of bullying, which she said was ‘deeply ingrained’ in the RSPCA’s culture. "},{"url":null,"title":"Famous London store hired COBRA guard diamond encrusted shoe TV documentary reveals","story":"    The cobra was guarding Rene Caovilla shoes which were encrusted with rubiesThe use of the snake in 2007 is just one of the extraordinary events recalled tonight in a TV documentary about the store’s hidden history.Former security guard Ray Wilding recalls that the most expensive single item he ever saw sold at the store – known for its big-spending customers – was a £500,000 watch.

She tells us about her meditative approach and why ‘thinking too much is boring’A translucent bubble floats in the air next to a picture of a baby’s head cradled tenderly in an adult’s arms. Nearby, among an arrangement of similarly intimate images, an infant’s tiny hand is gently enfolded in an elderly grandparent’s grasp. On a single wall in the National Portrait Gallery, amid the contrasting styles and subject matter of the 2018 Taylor Wessing portrait prize, Rinko Kawauchi’s vivid images of four generations of her family create a quietly intense space in which to pause and ponder the beauty and fragility of the everyday.Recently, that sense of life’s frailty has become more acute for Kawauchi following the birth of her daughter, whose first few years have been captured in characteristically hypnotic images. Since Kawauchi’s arrival on the art scene in 2001 with the simultaneous publication of three photobooks, Utatane (“Catnap”), Hanabi (“Fireworks”) and Hanako (a Japanese girl’s name), her family have featured in her work alongside often breathtakingly beautiful photographs of the natural world – insects, rainbows, clouds, butterflies and, of late, sacred rituals and ancient sites in her native Japan. She is an artist of the quotidian sublime, creating a world in which the tiniest details – a slice of watermelon on a plate, a bird’s egg cracking open – are imbued with meaning as part of the greater whole, the great interconnectedness.The images on show at the NPG are a continuation of an ongoing project that began with her 2005 book, Cui Cui, which comprised photographs of extended family taken over the previous 15 years. In that time, she witnessed the death of her grandfather and the birth of her nephew. It is not, though, she insists, a work of “personal disclosure” – rather a visual contemplation of the cycle of life in all its sadness and wonder.She is, she tells me in her faltering but often poetic English, “in sympathy with small things in the bigness of nature”. Her approach is patient, deeply attentive, akin to a kind of heightened meditation. “It’s about finding a certain space of mind, if that makes sense. When I am shooting, I am following my intuition without thinking. Thinking too much is boring, not good. It stops the surprising from coming through. When a picture happens, I just say ‘thank you’ and move on. It is only afterwards that I become an editor and impose the meaning on the work.”In person, the diminutive Kawauchi is quietly spoken and self-contained one senses that her work is an extension of her self. It is difficult to imagine her operating in the combative world of commercial advertising photography, which she did for several years after graduating from college in the early 1990s. She cites the American master of the everyday William Eggleston as a formative influence, alongside the younger Japanese photographer Takashi Homma. Her early images, which often seemed like deftly composed snapshots, were bathed in natural light and washed with bright colour tones that added to their almost dreamlike quality.In 2004, Martin Parr gave her two gallery spaces when he guest-curated Les Rencontres d’Arles, and in 2006 she had a solo show at the Photographer’s Gallery in London. Back then, I noted that her work “might initially appear to approach the deadpan detachment that characterises so much contemporary art-photography, but on closer inspection there is always some glimmer of hope and humanity, some sense of wonder at work in the rendering of the intimate and fragile.” That remains the case, but, of late, her vision has widened and deepened. In 2013, her series Ametsuchi announced a departure of sorts. Using a large format camera mounted on a tripod, she shot from a distance, creating panoramas of the stark, elemental, volcanic terrain around Japan’s Mount Aso, a sacred site for Shinto pilgrims who gather there to perform often spectacular fire rituals.Last year, Halo continued her exploration of these bigger themes. In rural Japan and China, she photographed other religious fire rituals and the vast constellations above. On England’s south-east coast, she captured the wondrous natural spectacle that is the murmuration of starlings. The private and the everyday had suddenly given way to the celestial elemental, the tranquil to the spectacular. And yet, they remained Rinko Kawauchi photographs: striking, luminous, poetic.“Halo is really about the relationship between nature and the manmade,” she says, “There is something about time passing in all the work and, with Halo, it is about a practice that is unchanging for hundreds of years while the world changes around it.”Her work is changing in other ways, too. When she began making work, Kawauchi gravitated towards the photobook as the perfect medium for her closely observed images of the world around her. Now, she is intrigued with the possibilities of the moving image. To this end, in 2015 she created an installation in a gallery in Shinjuku of video works mounted on 30 monitors, her images, both intimate and elemental, unfolding to an ambient soundtrack of natural noises – wind, insects – and “music created on real instruments”.I ask her, in conclusion, if being a mother has changed her approach to her work. She thinks for a long moment. “I would say yes, but not in the expected way. In my personal life, it has been amazing of course as a photographer, I am not so sure. When I feel happy, I see no reason to make work, but sometimes there is this hunger to make work. So, it is complicated. I need this hungry spirit and the calm. I need the balance to find the story inside me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bad1e9a83b76c79ef88d87c4b710d418878a837/0_416_6398_3839/master/6398.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=172be41a559b8e3877df3a4e0bc8d550 1010w","title":"the art of pumpkin carving in pictures","story":"“Pumpkin carving is an ephemeral art,” says Marc Evan. “The fact that pumpkins rot does not diminish their beauty or the experience of seeing them in person – if anything, it makes it more special.” Over the past 10 years, Evan and childhood friend Chris Soria have made a business out of carving pumpkins – and not just to scare.

The right soundtrack has the power to transform even a burger and chips into a fine-dining experience, at least according to research by Cornell University. Why? Because the music makes us eat more mindfully and even perceive our food more favourably.“Dinner parties are essentially about communication and the mingling of several different conversations, so you want background music that’s sophisticated enough to spark conversation, then melt away rather than competing with your chat,” says composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty recently topped the iTunes classical charts. So what music works best with different dishes? We spoke to a range of experts – from restaurateurs to party planners and composers to find out.Soundtrack for starters“I put as much thought and care into the music I play at a dinner party as I do into my cooking,” says restaurateur Asma Khan of the Darjeeling Express in Soho, London.Her favourite starter is a mutton shikampuri kebab, a recipe from the Royal Kitchens of Hyderabad. “It has a uniquely layered shah-jeera flavour,” she says. “You think it’s mild at first, then the cardamom and cumin spice blend hits you. Most people don’t recognise all the flavours, but this starter never fails to impress.”While guests dig in, Khan plays the classical Indian Sufi song Maula-e-Kull, sung by Abdida Parveen. “It has a very deep rhythm,” she says. “You don’t need to understand the words to feel the emotion in the voice of the singer: it starts off with the love between two people, then becomes deeply complex. Both the song and the starter have this incredible hidden layering, and together they set a rich, serene tone for your evening.”Your musical main“The right music helps the conversation flow, which is particularly important when your guests are meeting for the first time,” says Alice Matthews, founder of MotherHustler supper clubs.“I love the classical guitar interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Air on a G String, by Richard Mollenbeck,” she says. Like the vegetarian tagine she serves her guests, the music is about different interpretations of a classic, melodiously coming together to create something new. “I’ve discovered guests relax and enjoy themselves more when eating familiar food and listening to familiar music, but in a heightened, luxurious atmosphere,” she says.Sweet symphony“I love to cook with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, and my taste in music reflects that too,” says Henrietta Inman, author of The Natural Baker: A new way to bake using the best natural ingredients.“For a dinner party I’ll make my plum, blackberry and blueberry crumble, served with a rosemary and lemon syrup. The topping is crunchy and decadent, made with wholegrain spelt, oats and almonds.” And the perfect accompaniment? The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, says Inman.“It’s a beautifully tranquil piece by an English composer and it brings to mind a dusky evening eating outdoors, with birds singing in the hedgerows and trees hanging heavy with ripe fruit,” she says.The tune for cheese“The cheese course comes at a perfect moment to steer conversation into another direction,” says La Fromagerie’s Patricia Michelson, author of Cheese.She recommends presenting a five-strong board with Sinodun Hill, a nutty goat’s cheese the creamy, sweet and aromatic Beaufort Chalet D’Alpage Lincolnshire Poacher Double Barrel, a hard cheese with a distinctive savoury acidity from the chalky soil where the cattle graze a decadent Brie aux Truffes and Regalis, a ewe’s milk blue that combines sharp mineral qualities with a rich, floral taste.On the playlist is a classical composition with a jazz vibe, such as the Jacques Loussier Trio playing Bach. “It’s reflective and stimulating but soft and flowing, and these are words I often use when describing cheese too,” says Michelson.The finale Just as a digestif serves to calm the mood at the end of the meal, music plays a similar role. “One of the wonderful things about music is it fills in any awkward silence at the end of your dinner party, when everyone’s said an awful lot,” says Davis.“I love an Amaretto, but I wouldn’t be as didactic as to suggest that a sweet liqueur goes with sweet music,” he says. “Go for something cosy that welcomes guests into your own personal comfort zone.”For that, try downloading Rêverie Nocturne by Giulio Regondi or Liberty by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

His consort song for five voices and five viols is effectively an early 17th-century rendering of the sounds of Cockney stallholders advertising everything from “lilywhite mussels and new fresh herrings” to “roasted sausage, hot puddings, fresh cheese and cream, and ripe strawberries”. It may well have been inspired by Clément Jannequin’s Voulez ouyr les cris de Paris – similarly including the everyday sounds of a Renaissance French street market.While today there are a few restaurants in which music students will entertain you with arias between courses, in centuries past musical accompaniment to dining was a common phenomenon. The concept only became formalised in the 18th century and the best-known collection of such work is Telemann’s Tafelmusik, (Table Music). Published in 1733, it is a traditional set of suites to be played by a small group of string players at banquets.A musical work inspired by food, which became a popular sensation following its 1898 London premiere, is Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The cantata for tenor, mixed chorus and orchestra sets part of Longfellow’s epic poem, delighting in the lush and sensual choral description of the sumptuous menu: “First they ate the sturgeon … and the pike … then on pemmican they feasted … and buffalo marrow, haunch of deer and hump of bison, yellow cakes of the Mondamin, and the wild rice of the river.”Belshazzar’s Feast (1931) depicts another impressive meal, this time a lavish banquet thrown by the hedonistic and hubristic Babylonian king. In the biblical cantata by William Walton, apart from generous libations of wine drunk from sacred goblets looted from the Temple of Jerusalem, Osbert Sitwell’s libretto does not tell us what was on the menu. However, a clue is given in a description of the city’s resources for such a meal: “fine flour, wheat, beasts and sheep”, which we might conclude, like the score, was lavish.On a smaller scale, Erich Korngold’s Die Gansleber im Hause Duschnitz, (The Goose-liver in the Duschnitz House) is a song written spontaneously by the Austrian composer following a meal in 1919, thanking his Viennese hosts by honouring their delicious main course, with his lyrics declaring: “Because a goose liver like this is a wondrous thing … when it’s browned, when it’s crisp and crackly …”In a rare instance of music from the perspective of the food itself, there is Olim lacus Colueram. Known as the Song of the Roasting Swan, the exquisite aria for tenor and chorus comes from the pseudo-medieval secular cantata Carmina Burana (1936) in which composer Carl Orff manages to create a sense of dizzying musical rotation as the roasting bird delivers its, er, swansong, with the tenor singing at the top of his range in sympathetic anguish.Turning to something more sugary, Hansel and Gretel, Engelbert Humperdinck’s 1893 operatic retelling of the Grimm fairy tale, features a gingerbread house covered in sweets. Tchaikovsky’s festive ballet The Nutcracker (1892) is also filled with confectionary, in which, following mice eating gingerbread soldiers, young Clara and her prince are whisked off to the Land of Sweets, which is ruled by the Sugar Plum Fairy, an otherworldly character represented by a brand-new twinkling keyboard instrument, the celesta.Then there are cookbooks set to music. La Bonne Cuisine (1947) was inspired by Emile Dumont’s culinary guide. From it the American composer Leonard Bernstein arranged four recipes for mezzo-soprano and piano. The gastronomic delicacies are Plum Pudding, Ox-Tails, Turkish Delight and Rabbit at Top Speed – the last well-named, as the entire song-cycle is under five minutes. Three years later with Ode à la Gastronomie (1950), composer Jean Françaix showed that the French can also have a sense of humour when it comes to food. His lighthearted satire punctures the pretentious solemnity of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin’s 1825 tome La Physiologie du gout, offering a both comic and exquisite paean to the sensual pleasures of eating, setting the gastronomic ruminations as a choral work for 13 a capella singers.Eating, of course, provides a backdrop for dramatic action and consequently it often crops up in opera. A great example is Giacomo Puccini’s La Bohème, which migrates from a cold and empty flat in Montmartre to the local Cafe Momus. There, among the riot of life, street vendors shout their wares: “Oranges, dates, hot chestnuts, trinkets, crosses, nougat, whipped cream, fruit pies, toffees, finches, sparrows, dates, coconut milk, carrots, trout and plums.” The friends enter the bistro and order sausage, roast venison, table wine, dressed lobster, creme caramel and chicken, before leaving the bill for hapless sugar daddy Alcindoro.Finally, there is food inspired by classical musicians. French modernist Erik Satie ate only white foods, so for more mouthwatering invocations one must look to the Italians and dishes created in their honour. Neapolitan tenor Enrico Caruso had a sauce named after him by Uruguayan chef Raymundo Monti. Salsa Caruso is a warm sauce for pasta consisting of cream, onions, ham, cheese, nuts and mushrooms. Meanwhile, Tournedos Rossini is a steak dish created by French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in collaboration with the famously food-loving composer. It consists of beef tournedos pan-fried in butter, served on a crouton, topped with hot slice of foie gras, garnished with black truffle and Madeira demi-glace sauce.And for afters? How about peach melba, the famous dessert of peaches and raspberry sauce with vanilla ice-cream, created in 1892 by French chef Auguste Escoffier at London’s Savoy Hotel for the Australian soprano Dame Nellie. Quite a final movement, that is.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing. Feeling inspired to cook your own masterpiece tonight?

Bram Stoker’s Dracula has turned Whitby into a capital of gothic extravagance. Ever since, writers have gone on exploring the combination of natural wildness, extremes of grandeur and suffering, and frequent flashes of bizarre humour.I don’t know about a “top 10”, but two recent novels show that the gothic is as entertaining, and as shocking, as it ever was. Fiona Mozley’s Elmet has tempestuous family relationships, set within a lyrically evoked Yorkshire landscape. Andrew Michael Hurley’s The Loney begins with a child’s body on a beach, but his interest is less in a thriller and more in extreme metaphysical questions and grotesque characters.Gothic writing is always on the verge of bursting the bounds of genre. You might like to look at novels originally intended for children. Alan Garner’s Elidor is an unforgettable welding of 1960s Manchester and a fantasy kingdom of real threat. There is, too, the unmistakably gothic genius of Ted Hughes. Even when he isn’t explicitly writing about a particular place, his attachment to nature, cruelty and freakish humour ties him to a Yorkshire gothic. Try Crow.But of course, some writers enjoy the strict rules of a genre. Susan Hill’s The Woman in Black goes on delighting and terrifying new generations of readers and theatregoers, doing precisely what the classical ghost story has always set out to do.

She talks politics, swearing – and how poetry has changed since she started writing“Combover ... twitter-rat, tweet-twat, tripe-gob, muckspout” … so runs the first stanza of “Swearing In” by Carol Ann Duffy. “That was fun to write”, the poet laureate says, laughing. The poem uses kennings, an ancient form that describes something using compound words – in this case a Duffyesque litany of insults, mixing medieval and Elizabethan phrases with modern or invented coinages (“tie-treader”: “he wears very long ties”). “‘Mandrake mymmerkin’ … I’ll leave you to research that,” she says. If you haven’t guessed the subject, the poem ends: “welcome to the White House”.In her new collection, Sincerity, her last as laureate, Duffy is not pulling any punches. “I like the word ‘sincerity’,” she says. “To speak and act out of one’s beliefs, thoughts, feelings.” She was also drawn to its etymology, derived from the way in which “dodgy sculptors” in ancient Greece and Rome would conceal mistakes or flaws by covering them with wax. So “without wax” (sine cera in Latin), “means genuine, not duplicitous,” she explains. “I liked that as a title.”She spent much time ordering the selection so the poems “speak to each other”. It is not a very polite conversation: “A Formal Complaint”, which follows “Swearing In”, is even more to the point. Again she has fun with another ancient form, this time the sestina, used – as the title suggests – to make a political objection, in which six key words are rotated in a strict pattern as line endings, all coming together in a furious finale. Her choice words – “arseholes”, “gatekeepers”, “chancers”, “tossers”, bullshitters”, “patriots” – give the general idea.Isn’t it all a bit, well, sweary for a poet laureate? She pulls a face. “I think the past couple of years, with the evil twins of Trump and Brexit … I don’t remember ever having felt such a kind of lowering abstract stress coming from the political aura. It’s just so demoralising. You feel powerless,” she replies. “There was no way of not writing about that, because it is just in the air.”But Sincerity is also very personal, with quieter poems on bereavement and the less talked about grief, or “shy sorrow”, of a child leaving home. She set out “to see where I am at this age”, her early 60s: “I think poets should write not only from somewhere but from somewhen.” Like her poetry, Duffy is disarmingly direct, warm and a little bit fierce (sincere, even), with a steeliness that comes, perhaps, from growing up the elder sister of four brothers in working-class Stafford. Poetry, she says, should never “be up its own arse”.Compared to her bestselling collections, the tender sexiness of Rapture (2005), or the comic rowdiness of The World’s Wife (1999), Sincerity may appear angrier and more political, but she has never been afraid of speaking out. She captured the Thatcher years in her early collection The Other Country, but the situation today is “much worse” even than the 80s. “I’ve never ever thought ‘I’m going to write a political poem’,” she says now. “It is just the relentless pressure of it that squeezes those kinds of poems out of you.”She stresses “how the political moves out of the personal”, for example in one of her new poems, “Britannia”, which connects the Grenfell fire last year with the Aberfan tragedy in 1966. “I remember my father talking about the negligence of the coal board allowing that slide. Fifty years later we are all traumatised by Grenfell … these national disasters that have a principle or cause about them.” The one constant, as the last line has it, was “the dutiful Queen visiting”.There is a refrain of mourning running through Sincerity. “I’m putting down markers for things that we can lose,” she agrees, such as “civil society or a way of having grace in our public lives”, but also for more private losses. “You have dead parents,” “The Rain” ends, brutally. “As anyone who has lost their parents knows, it can take a very long time to feel comfortable with all the happy memories and being back in the world,” she reflects. It took her two years to write about her mother’s death, which she did in her gentle 2009 elegy “Premonitions”. (A vigorous, youthful May Duffy was celebrated in the lovely poem “Before You Were Mine”.) In this collection she writes of taking her mother’s wedding ring off her finger when she died: “the small o in love and loss”. She also revisited a much earlier poem, “Dark School”, after her father died in 2011 in the very classroom where she studied Latin as a child, her convent school having been converted into a nursing home. The poem “seemed to have a kind of prophetic quality to it – it was very, very strange,” she says now.“Empty Nest”, for her daughter Ella (Duffy is an unashamedly doting mother), is at the heart of the collection. “When our children leave and go to university and start their lives it’s a very hidden grief,” she says. “We tend to be stiff upper lipped, but it is a real blow. You still are a parent, but that kind of daily devotional ritual is gone.” She plans to put together an anthology on the subject “so that people have somewhere to go with that sorrow”.Her favourite of all her poems, “A Child’s Sleep”, from Meeting Midnight (1999), was written when Ella was only 18 months old, and might be a bookend to “The Empty Nest”. “I stood at the edge of my child’s sleep hearing her breathe ...” The lunchtime clatter of the London station restaurant seems hushed as she recites the poem from memory, then explains how she wrote it: “there was a full moon outside the window, so it was as if the moon was looking at me looking at her. It was quite an extraordinary moment.” Her voice, a wandering mix of her parents’ Irish lilt and the flat Scots of her childhood, has a hypnotic quality, well-suited to her incantatory verse.For Duffy, there is another ending looming: in May she steps down as the nation’s official poet, anticipated in the mischievous poem “The Monkey”, about a real monkey she encountered in Marrakech, but also about “the idea of anarchy … of stopping one life and starting another one”. When she was appointed in 2009 much was made of her sexuality, and the fact that she was the first woman, and the first Scot, to become poet laureate in the position’s 400-year history. (She brushes off the 1999 brouhaha that ensued when her predecessor Andrew Motion was chosen over her because Tony Blair reportedly thought she might be too bold a choice for middle England, as so much tabloid “crap”.) But she is reluctant to comment on broader cultural issues such as the #MeToo movement or identity politics. For her, the role is all about being an ambassador for poetry.“I don’t think the poet laureate is the ‘best poet’,” she says, not for the first time. “I think the poet laureate is a representative poet.” And she has been a tireless champion of her fellow poets: even her readings are usually billed “Carol Ann Duffy and friends”. One of the standout experiences of her laureateship was Shore to Shore, “a bus-load of poets on a grand tour” picking up more poets along the way. The first was in 2016, when they travelled from Falmouth to St Andrews, coincidentally “with the Brexit vote right in the middle” – a great way “to hear all the voices and all the reasons”.She organised a small reading for a party at Buckingham Palace five years ago including Caribbean poet John Agard, the 2012 winner of the Queen’s gold medal for poetry, who gave a rousing rendition of his “Alternative Anthem”, with its refrain “put the kettle on”. “That was a great moment: seeing the Queen join in saying: ‘Put the kettle on!” Another highlight was being on board the Queen’s barge for the jubilee celebrations: “An incredible dream. It was such a shame it was raining.” (Duffy was below deck with a whisky.)One of her earliest public poems as laureate was “The Last Post” in 2009, to mark the deaths of the last veterans of the first world war (she has just edited Armistice, a centenary anthology published this month) her most recent was for the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May. “Their wedding ended with what they called ‘the long walk’ going up to Windsor Castle and I remembered how we all watched when he was a little boy behind his mother’s coffin and what a hideous long walk that was, a terrible situation for a child to be in and yet here he was, and here we all were watching him again.” But don’t expect a poem for the new arrival: she’s never felt a royal baby poem to be “necessary”. Although she feels no obligation, she wrote “The Crown” to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s coronation, because “I do get the sense that whether or not you are a monarchist or a republican, people respect and admire the Queen very much.”She is an ideal laureate in that she is happy to accept a wide range of commissions, a willingness I can vouch for having asked her to write poems for this paper on events including the Scottish referendum, the 2012 Olympics and the Manchester Arena bombing last year. The reaction to these responsive, immediate verses has inevitably been mixed, especially on Twitter, which she avoids fellow poet Ian Patterson was particularly damning about her Stephen Lawrence poem. But such sniffiness has been rare. It’s a question of “trying to keep your finger on the pulse of what people might be interested in, or where the voice or the language of poetry might be worth adding to the kind of national babble and blether and jabber,” she says.Poetry has changed a great deal in the 10 years of her tenure: “We have Instagram poets, performance poetry has exploded, there’s much more ersity.” When her first collection, Standing Female Nude, was published in 1985, she was introduced “as a poetess”, she says incredulously. “You can tell by the title of that collection, that I was keen on asserting feminist principles.” Sadly, “we still have a way to go”.Her mantra is borrowed from Picasso: “Inspiration will come, but it must find you working.” When she is at home she is at her desk, either in her study, at the kitchen table, in an attic library or in the garden (she had to resist having a special rain-shelter desk built). It rains a lot in her poems: “I live in Manchester, what do you expect?” she retorts. “Also, I like poems with rain in.” She has literally surrounded herself with poetry, there are even poems on her doors, handpainted by the artist Stephen Raw: Robert Herrick, “So Good-luck came, and on my roof did light” on the study “Snow” by Louis MacNeice George Herbert’s “Prayer” and – inside the kitchen – William Carlos Williams’s “This Is Just to Say”. Poetry, she says, “comes out of silence. There can be days when nothing emerges from the silence.” But she certainly doesn’t seem to have been afflicted by “the curse of the poet laureate” (Motion grumbled that taking the post hampered his own writing). “I’ve loved it,” she says. “It’s been an absolute joy.”What advice would she give to her successor? “Be yourself. Celebrate poets and poetry. And enjoy it.”They rise above us, the ex-ministers,in private jets, left wing, right wing, drop lowto Beijing, Kuwait, the Congo, Kazakhstantheir deals and contracts in the old red boxes, for sentimental reasons.Beyond our shores, they float on superyachts, Nostrovia!, guests of the mortal gods the vague moon a Bitcoin.We are nothing to them now lemmingsgoing over the white cliffs of Dover.And when they are here, they are unseen chauffeured in blacked-out cars to the bars in the heavens – far, glittering shards – to look down on our lucrative democracy.Though they have bought the same face, so they will know each other.Dear child, the house pines when you leave.I research whether there is any bird who grieves over its empty nest.Your vacant roomis a still-life framed by the unclosed doorread by sunlight, an open book on the floor.I fold the laundry hang your flower dress in darkness.

She had 300 notebooks and diaries, some of them ordinary notebooks that a journalist keeps, but then there were all these very intimate personal diaries.

But also many moments of recognition. For example, there was a great bit in the diary in which as a 13-year-old girl she writes about having to go to Mass with her family: “To church. Wore mini. The mother and the father no like.” In that moment I thought, I know the woman that girl became. But then there were other moments: I would read stuff in her diary from later on and I’d find myself wanting to ring her and say: “Marie, what really happened?” And then I’d remember: “Oh gosh, I can’t ring her.”Has writing the book made you rethink your own ideas about war reporting and being a reporter?Well, it made me think that it was a very good thing that I destroyed my teenage diaries. Marie took a lot more risks than I did and if one puts it crudely that’s why I’m alive and she isn’t. I always feel outclassed by her in the sense that she was much braver than I am. And I’m very envious of her for being able to be that brave and be so determined. Then I also think I don’t envy her because, you know, the title In Extremis, is about how she lived her own life in extremis, as well as the people she reported on. I’m glad that I have a more stable personal life than she did, because it caused her so much pain.It seems Colvin was targeted by the Assad regime and recently we’ve seen a number of prominent journalists killed or imprisoned. Are reporters under greater threat now than ever before?Definitely. I think Marie’s killing and the kidnap of James Foley marked a watershed when it became unacceptably dangerous for many editors to send reporters into those situations. If you look at what’s happening now, the people under greatest threat are investigative reporters. I mean, three investigative reporters murdered within the European Union this year. One in Malta, one in Slovakia and one in Bulgaria, and most recently Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist. It seems to me that with this nexus of corrupt governments and organised crime that investigative journalists are under more threat now than at any time in my career.There is a mythology attached to war reporters to which war reporters themselves are not immune. Do you think Colvin felt an obligation to live up to her own myth?Marie had the glamour. The eye patch she wore after her eye was shot in Sri Lanka – she had one studded with rhinestones for parties. She definitely did live up to that image and arguably her editors cultivated that image. One of the things I go into in the book is that sometimes she didn’t feel like that person inside. She felt vulnerable and scared. She had bad luck or bad judgment in love, depending on how you look on it, and it was difficult for her psychologically to reconcile those two versions of herself. But she couldn’t help but be glamorous because she was glamorous. That’s who she was.What’s the best novel or nonfiction work you’ve read about war reporting?Obviously I have to say Scoop because it brings out the absurdity of everything we do, but one of the books I read when thinking about writing this book was Sweet Caress by William Boyd, which is about a female war photographer of the 1940s. I really enjoyed that. And I think the biography of Lee Miller by Carolyn Burke is brilliant.What kinds of biography do you like to read?I really enjoyed Hermione Lee on Penelope Fitzgerald and Nicholas Shakespeare on Bruce Chatwin because they sent me back to the original works. A memoir that I think is brilliant is Just Kids by Patti Smith.Which literary genres do you most enjoy?When I travel I always carry poetry with me. I read and reread quite a lot of James Fenton and WH Auden and recently Wisława Szymborska, poetry that deals with the same issues I’m covering, issues of war and peace and so on. I think everybody should be made to read Auden’s Epitaph on a Tyrant every week!Which classic novel did you read recently for the first time?I didn’t. I’m a bad, bad person, unless you count John le Carré’s The Russia House.Which book would you give to a young person?If a very small person, I love those feminist fairy tales such as Princess Smartypants. For a teenager, I think The Poisonwood Bible because it’s a complex story about a complex place, the Congo, but it’s told from the point of view of the children.What books are on your bedside table?I am a news journalist in the end so I’m having a bit of a Russian spy phase. The two on my table are Ben Macintyre’s The Spy and the Traitor and A Spy Named Orphan, Roland Philipps’s biography of Donald Maclean.• In Extremis by Lindsey Hilsum is published by Vintage (£20).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing. He pleads for another chapter each time we finish one. ‘You can read this yourself,’ I said. ‘Yes, but it’s funner having you read it so I can imagine it in my head’ he said. Wonderful.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

He said he respected the opinion of lawyers who disagreed with his intervention, but that he stood by his decision to name the retail tycoon, who had secured an injunction preventing details of the case from being revealed.“I stand resolutely by what I’ve said and neither retract nor apologise for standing up for human rights,” he said. His comments, made in interview with the Observer, come after Green said it was outrageous for Hain to have named him, and that he would lodge a formal complaint with the House of Lords.Green also criticised Hain for not revealing his links to the law firm that had been working with the  in its efforts to name him. He repeated that “to the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations”.Hain said: “Parliamentary privilege is a precious part of our constitution and an expression of parliament’s absolute sovereignty, but it should only ever be used sparingly, with total integrity and responsibility,. It is not something that one should ever abuse and it should never be used randomly.“On this occasion, I took a judgment, which others will, in turn, assess as being right or wrong and I respect that. I respect the view of lawyers who criticise it, though others have supported it.“I have no quarrel with the appeals court or with any members of the judiciary on this point. They have a job to do, but so do parliamentarians. What is the point of being a member of parliament, either in the Commons or in the Lords, if you don’t discharge your responsibilities and, where appropriate, use the privileges that you have in order to promote justice and liberty?”The former attorney general Dominic Grieve is among those to criticise Hain. He said he had abused parliamentary privilege and acted arrogantly.It has emerged that Hain was a paid adviser to Gordon Dadds, the law firm instructed by the  in its attempts to name Green. Hain has said he took the decision to name Green “in my personal capacity as an independent member of the House of Lords. I categorically state that I was completely unaware Gordon Dadds were advising the  regarding this case”.A spokesman for the law firm denied “any suggestion that Gordon Dadds LLP has in any way acted improperly”.Of his previous uses of parliamentary privilege, Hain said: “I used parliamentary privilege to name a dozen arms dealers who were flying in arms to Sierra Leone, some of which were turned on British soldiers trying to defeat the terrorist group there,” he said.“Arms were also being sent to Angola, fuelling a bloody and traumatic civil war, and to the Congo, where they were also being used to promote conflict. These arms dealers were being paid in illegal diamonds.“On the second occasion, I was passed information by very brave whistleblowers to whom I was introduced by ANC stalwarts horrified by what was going on under President Zuma’s corrupt presidency.“So that is three times during my time as a parliamentarian, dating back to 1991. So it is not something i have ever done lightly. The first two cases were clear cut, though it hadn’t been done before. And on this third occasion, obviously I did not do this lightly, either. It was after deep consideration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e8fec963e76d5b662068605c6d08c5d09caf2f0/0_130_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=133231804fdc18d0576d711a986654b4","title":"work once way to better life not any more property pensions","story":"It is often said that people are defined by their work. Whether the job is in mining, teaching or engineering, it provides an income, status, friends and a sense of community.Yet for a long time now work has become secondary to being a savvy consumer, a homeowner (or, better still, a multiple homeowner) and a pension saver. It’s not a trend the Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party recognises. But it’s a sad fact that a job is no longer the primary route to a better life, unless promotions – which often only add to the stress and long hours that employers already demand – are part of the plan.If workers have any spare time, it doesn’t go into campaigning in their workplace for better terms and conditions. It is spent in the long queue at Aldi and Lidl for cheaper food. It is spent scouring the newspaper best-buy tables for a cheaper mortgage deal, a lower energy tariff or discounted car insurance.And if there is a hint of a cut to a worker’s pension, they will leap up and vote for the party that promises to protect their entitlements, and even consider industrial action.In part, this change reflects a rolling back of labour laws and with them the sense of solidarity among workers. It also follows the shift to an economic model that relies on workers to be more accommodating each year in their role as business and consumer service providers.The irony is that when the consumer is made king, workers are forced to become even more flexible, providing services on a 24-hour cycle, usually to the detriment of their own health and wellbeing.Some politicians have sensed that the tide is turning, and that workers have had enough of flat wage growth and employers that seek to improve profits almost exclusively at their expense.It was clear once the promised bounceback from the financial crash failed to materialise that the trend for ever-worsening conditions and meagre pay needed to change.George Osborne’s answer as chancellor was just to raise the minimum wage. Theresa May’s speech on taking office was to argue that workers should be more actively involved in the workplace. She even pledged to give workers seats on boards, putting them at the heart of corporate decision-making.Corbyn’s rise to the top of the Labour party has also brought with it an emphasis on workers and workers’ rights. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has a vision of an economy made up of cooperatives and worker-influenced corporations, with staff owning shares and using them to influence the direction of travel. The gig economy will be reined in with extra employment protections, he says. The privatisation of industries by Margaret Thatcher and John Major will be reversed, with workers given at least some control.To provide some intellectual ballast, the IPPR thinktank’s recent report on economic justice hammers home a message of hope around the re-emergence of the worker, back at the heart of corporate life.This is a conversation young people are having after years of being told they should be grateful to be employed at all.Young people, however, have very little influence at work: the baby-boomer generation runs things. Now 54 years old or more, its members started out as workers and might even have belonged to a trade union. They cared about their pay and how their boss behaved. But then they switched to consumption as a route to status: they are now primarily property owners, pension savers or pension receivers.Before any angry baby-boomers declare that they are still union members and care deeply about their colleagues’ pay and conditions – or that they put their personal finances second to considerations like the environment – it is clear they are in the minority. There are so many indicators that the majority of their peers – fearful of the future, determined to maintain their living standards – put their wealth before the workplace that there isn’t space to discuss them all.That is why May can get away with ignoring her pledge to put workers on boards – it is obvious there are not as many votes in it as her advisers thought.And if there were a groundswell of opinion in favour, it is neutered by a lack of faith in today’s trade unions, most of which are far more concerned with internal Labour politics than with addressing the declining terms and conditions of their members.Industrial action – last week’s equal pay strike in Scotland aside – is taken almost exclusively to protect pension entitlements. Unfortunately, the most experienced and better-off workers are still too busy shopping and saving to confront the boss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07f1656bf6a8132ff6b9e7984de1aa0b9b6669d0/0_256_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ad9e6777e35588a24074796274bfbbc","title":"megyn kelly nbc partisan divide","story":"The fact that 47-year-old woman did not already understand the history and harm of blackface justifies NBC parting ways with herFollowing Megyn Kelly’s latest demonstration of poor judgment and ignorance by condoning the wearing of blackface for Halloween, NBC is now set to part ways with her. And while Kelly’s departure might be shocking due to NBC’s massive investment in Kelly — a $23m annual salary and a coveted role on Today — it was seemingly inevitable.In early 2017, NBC News chief Andrew Lack hired Kelly from Fox News with the hope that she could appeal to conservative viewers without alienating their more liberal MSNBC viewers. And right from the start, Kelly’s desire to give voice to right-wing conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones essentially foretold the sooner rather than later end of her NBC tenure.On its own, Kelly’s defense of wearing blackface on Tuesday’s episode of her show Megyn Kelly Today warrants the cancelling of her show, but it is also the final straw within her short and rocky tenure at NBC. Additionally, it represents a microcosm of her inadequacy as a bipartisan television personality.It is much easier to condone blackface when you have no black neighbors.Kelly grew up in a world without ersity and she still employs the lessons from her youth as a guide within an increasingly erse and racially equitable America. Kelly tacitly yearns for the simplicity of her homogenous white upbringing as a panacea against the complexity of an America with a growing chorus of non-white voices.This inclination makes her wholly inadequate to progressives, yet her conservative appeal has also fallen since she left Fox News. Kelly exists within a cultural, political, and journalistic no man’s land.Lack brought Kelly to NBC to bridge the partisan ide, yet despite her evident disdain for Trump she unintentionally espouses his isive philosophy albeit with a slightly more palatable façade.While it would be unfair to describe Kelly as a racist, the logical and emotional foundations of her stance on blackface bear greater resemblance to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” rhetoric than any other current political message. They both ache for a white dominated yesteryear where overt racism was not considered racism because America’s systemic racism had effectively silenced the voices, ignored the history, and marginalized the existence of the non-white Americans negatively impacted by these actions. One side thirsts for white supremacy and the other remains cosseted in the ignorance of non-white people and the systemic racism that buttresses their white homogeneity. Kelly is obviously the latter.On her Wednesday show Kelly issued a public apology and soon thereafter it was announced that she would not appear on her show for the rest of the week. Later in the day, Lack held a town hall meeting with NBC staff and denounced Kelly’s comments: “There is no other way to put this: I condemn those remarks there is no place on our air or in this workplace for them.”In Kelly’s internal and public apologies she stressed how via conversations with close friends and colleagues she has learned the error of her ways. Regardless of whether Kelly has or has not turned a corner, the fact that a 47-year-old woman did not already understand the history and harm of blackface means that she should no longer be considered an authority figure with the nous to inform and educate the public in our increasingly complex, tense and racially fraught climate.Kelly was supposed to help NBC appeal to Americans on the left and the right, but all she did was perpetuate the dangerous ignorance and anxiety many white Americans feel in an increasingly erse America. This misguided rhetoric only drives us further apart, so it only makes sense for Kelly and NBC to part ways too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d45cbc0edbbb45735e92182962d7cbd8fbcd3d0/0_311_1927_1156/master/1927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36cf3ad66f550405fef00996372d9139","title":"nostalgia doesnt come much more joyous than this","story":"After an epic 10 hours on Thursday spent running around after a two-year-old, there was only one plan for Friday: to be nailed to the sofa with an ongoing stream of half-forgotten black-and-white British movies from the 40s and 50s.These were the films that those of us born in the middle of the 20th century would have seen on wet Saturday afternoons on television and which seemed to be preserved only in the collective memory of an ageing audience. What was that film that was set on the Cornish coast about the dead concert pianist whose reincarnation comes back to haunt her weird, spinster sister that so spooked me, aged eight or 10? Thanks to Talking Pictures TV, launched three years ago, we now know the answer: it’s While I Live (1947), a swirling psychological melodrama of amnesia and obsession, whose soundtrack, The Dream of Olwen, is a Pavlovian nudge to memories of floral pelmets, glasses of Ribena, plates of rich tea biscuits and the national anthem.In a time of Brexit, Donald Trump and climate change, there needs to be an occasional escape to a time when one’s main anxiety was the disfiguring ink blot on one’s English homework. Talking Pictures is a haven of put your feet up and have a nice cup of tea escapism to a monochrome world that existed for decades pre-reality television.It began as an independent channel in 2015 on Sky after the main networks rejected the founders’ approaches to show some classic movies. At first, it screened a quirky nostalgia-fest of oddities: British B movies, quota quickies, second features, filmed travelogues of the English seaside by yacht.These were staples of pre-television cinema-going when distributors had to satisfy the appetites of audiences who would queue for the “one-and-sixes” three or four times a week.One fly-by-night director of only four features, including the raffish It Happened in Soho (1948), Frank Chisnell was so obscure that while IMDb records his date of birth (1898), his date of death remains unknown.Within a few months, Talking Pictures launched as a free terrestrial channel and, over one firecracker week, resurrected such films as Tom Jones, Sunday Bloody Sunday and A Taste of Honey, slowly gaining an audience by publicising itself through word of mouth on social media. This year, it has shown The Servant, They Shoot Horses Don’t They?, The Swimmer and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, most of which are giants of 60s cinema.Talking Pictures is now the go-to channel for film classics. Many viewers still haven’t heard of it. It has fought to be listed in the Radio Times and other listings magazines and distributes its schedule through a weekly email.Mostly, it seems to expand its tiny audience reach through retweets by its fans on Twitter.All through the day and night it ploughs on, screening 60s television detective series such as Public Eye, starring Alfred Burke, which miraculously escaped deletion at a time when whole Wednesday Plays and episodes of Dad’s Army were erased by the BBC to cut storage costs. On Sunday,Today, you can see Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh in Fire Over England (1937), David Niven in Paper Tiger (1975) and Maggie Smith in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.Accompanied by Wikipedia, it is possible to chart a whole history of postwar motion picture careers, to watch the ghosts of entire casts: the music hall artiste whose life ended in a home for retired screen actors the beauty whose credits were cut short by early death the director who gravitated to television the ingénue who became a Bond girl the now completely forgotten novelist whose bestseller was adapted for the movies.Many of these pictures were small to begin with, but they were the stories that our parents and grandparents wanted to be told in the postwar era. Congratulations to Talking Pictures for almost single-handedly reviving classic films. We needed this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb8010b32da42cc082c7b75ac70f34b321cc0587/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca3305d66c6255830896e34a879ca2ba","title":"danny dyer james bond philomena cunk explains culture","story":"As the famed thinker prepares to publish her first encyclopedia of everything ever, she pontificates on Mozart, Norbit and moreDanny Dyer is probably the greatest actor of his generation. Born Danial Dandy Dan D Dyer on his birthday in 1977, he rose to fame. His first big film appearance was as one half of the title role in Human Traffic. But he is probably best known for his tear-breaking performance as landlord Mick Carter in the never-ending TV drama EastEnders. Dyer brings his tremendous sensitivity and range to his work. In the epic romantic film Run for Your Wife, he brings everything you’d expect to the character of John Smith. And when he appeared as Danny Dyer in Who Do You Think You Are?, critics praised the moving scenes in which he discovered that he had ancestors. He is also known as a fiercely outspoken commentator, and has famously suggested that cocaine is an excellent reward for a job well done, that cutting your ex’s face is a good way of getting over her and that breaking Mark Kermode’s nose is a good way of getting over him. He should definitely be the next James Bond.Games of Throne is an epic and exciting programme on the television and computers and your phone which is based on the play King Lord of the Rings by William Shakespeare. It’s set in sort of series one Black Adder times, before dragons became extinct. It’s weird watching it because most of the time it’s like medieval Made in Chelsea or something, just all these people getting pissed off with each other and looking serious saying loads of made up stuff in old language. It’s so old-fashioned the script is probably given to them in the form of a tapestry. Then, just as you’re getting bored with them talking and talking and walking about and talking, they have a huge spectacular fight with some zombie monsters, or a dragon monster flies down and starts having a go at them and you think maybe it was worth sitting through all the talking and then it all starts again.You might think it’s for kids, like Harry Potter, because of the dragons, but the thing is it’s also got loads of tits in it, so you know it’s grown-up. If there’s one thing you can say about tits, it’s that they’re not for babies. There’s so much tits in the programme it’s a bit like a hanging around in the ladies’ changing room of some historical re-enactment society. Some people say it’s gratuitous but I think it’s important to know women’s tits looked roughly the same in fictional medieval times as they do now. They must have spent ages researching it, but it’s good that someone was that thorough. It shows. One of the main characters is called Jon Snow, but before he did the news. When he was younger he was this tortured soldier man with really nice hair, which is quite an achievement when you think about how hard it must be to maintain a half-decent male grooming regime by candlelight in a violent fantasy realm when you’re constantly being distracted by dragons and tits.Games of Throne doesn’t just tell the story of Jon Snow off the news when he was in medieval fantastic times, it does that for loads of people. It’s mainly British actors you’ve seen in Midsomer Murders and Morse and that, but what they were doing before, when there were dragons. So it’s quite educational. If you were doing a history degree at University about what the suspects in Midsomer Murders were doing when they were goblins, it’d be a great way to revise. The show is so popular, that that’ll probably be a round on University Challenge one day, or a one-off special, with Jeremy Paxman in a smock.Of all the composers who have ever lived, none has written quite as many tunes as Wolfgang Rock Me “Amadeus” Mozart. Mozart was born in 1756 in Austria, though it wasn’t called Austria then. By the age of three, he was playing the piano, though it wasn’t called the piano then. People thought he was the Prodigy, but the Prodigy wouldn’t be born for over 200 years, so he could go about his everyday composing business without people mistaking him for the angry one and asking him to play Firestarter on the harpsichord, which left him more time to invent hit songs like The Marriage of Fig Roll and Concerto No 21, which he did. Little Tiny Mozart wrote his first tunes aged five, and his first symphony aged eight. This is amazing, because he could have been out on his bike or climbing a tree like a normal kid. His parents sent Mozart and his sister out on tour around Europe performing their hits before the courts of Prague, Vienna, Paris, Munich and London. Why they did their tunes in court is a mystery, but probably because there were judges there, and they were hoping to get through to the judges’ houses, where they’d have a better chance of a record deal.By the time Mozart wrote his first opera at the age of 14, it was clear he wasn’t normal at all. For a start, he was 14 and could sit through an opera. Something had to be done. So he got a job as an organist. But that didn’t stop his compulsive tune-writing, and he just kept forcing more and more music out of himself, like he had the shits, but with notes. Eventually, poor and exhausted, he took to his bed to die. Even then, he couldn’t do it without music, so he wrote his most famous last work, the Requiem, which is a very long song in Latin about dying. It’s very much the East 17’s Stay Another Day of its day, and would have been on a John Lewis ad if Christmas had been invented back then. But he didn’t finish it, and it died along with him in 1791. He was 33, the same age as Guy Fawkes was when he died, leaving his greatest work – blowing up parliament – also unfinished.Films are a sort of television that’s longer than one television programme (say, Bargain Hunt) but not as long as watching all of, say, Bargain Hunt. Unlike normal television, films don’t come to your house if you’re not interested in them any more. You have to go and visit films where they live, which is this really big hot dog kiosk called a cinema. The hot dogs here are bigger and not as nice as the ones you can make at home using real sausages, so they take longer to eat. This means they have to give you somewhere to sit down, but because nobody likes watching strangers eat, they make all the seats face away from each other, and then, to give you something to look at, they put on a film. Here are some films that exist …Some men go to sea to chase after some barrels, probably because they think there might be beer in them. The twist is that hiding under the barrels is a shark who has learned that the men love barrels and is using them as bait. The clever shark tries to kill the men by exploding when they get near, but the men hide under the water and die, which is a lucky escape for everyone, except one of them, who luckily escapes.Four Weddings and a Funeral Hard-to-follow drama about posh people who have lots of things to go to in a row, but fortunately have loads of suits and frocks anyway, so nothing’s in the cleaners, and it’s not really a problem. Looked it up and apparently it’s actually three weddings and a funeral and then another wedding, which makes it a bit easier to follow.The Cannonball Run Only seen the end. Which was brilliant. On one side of the screen is a poem made out of people’s names, and on the other side of the screen is a sort of You’ve Been Framed with sex offenders. I should make clear I don’t know who any of them are in the clips, and they’re probably not sex offenders, but it was the 1970s and we’ve learned not to make assumptions.Citizen Kane Black and white.Nuns on the Run If you’ve seen The Sound of Music or Sister Act, you’ll know how annoying it is when a nun starts singing in a film, because it holds up the story, and the nun never gets to do a good bit like push Alan Rickman off a ledge or fight dinosaurs. This is an interesting film because it has no singing in it, but it also doesn’t have any good bits, so maybe it just proves that nuns and films don’t mix. A warning from God.Star Wars 2: Star Wars Strikes Back If you’ve seen the first one, The Star Wars Menace, this probably makes sense, but someone told me that one was hopeless, so fuck that, and I’ve gone straight in at what they say is the best one, and it’s not. For a start, Fozzie Bear is really old in this one, and doesn’t do any jokes, and they’ve given him Kermit’s face by mistake. So someone really isn’t paying attention. It ends really weird, with this Jeremy Kyle bit about who’s whose dad, and then he falls down a hole, and they catch him and that’s meant to be the end, even though they don’t say what happens to any of them. They should do one of those bits at the end they sometimes do with old photos and some words that say which ones went to prison and who died. That or outtakes, like in The Cannonball Run.The Braun Elegance Hair Straighteners Demonstration Video Seen this loads. Hard to talk about without spoilers, but well worth getting a copy. It’s never on at the cinema, but I found mine on video cassette down Barnardo’s. It’s my favourite film apart from Norbit.NorbitNo. Hang about. Not Norbit. I’m thinking of Big Momma’s House.

From an infantile infatuation with skeletons to a bah-humbug resentment of corporate marketing, I have now rejoined the wacky bandwagon (with the help of my young children) and wonder why I ever thought apple bobbing, pumpkin carving, tricks and treats were so bad. I have taken this rediscovered zeal pretty far today, with ghosts and gnarly monster’s feet, so do rein in the spook and shape these delicious treats in any way you like. And I wish you all a terribly terrifying night.I used a ghost-shaped cutter, but use any you have to hand, or none at all. If you do use one, you’ll have trimmings to dip in chocolate, which is no bad thing. The ghosts will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. 125g unsalted butter300g white mini marshmallows (or regular white marshmallows), roughly cut into 1.5cm pieces1 tsp vanilla extract1 tsp toasted sesame oil½ tsp flaked sea salt160g Rice Krispies 3 tbsp sesame seeds, lightly toasted125g plain or vanilla halva, roughly crumbledTo decorate (optional)80g white chocolate, cut into roughly 1cm pieces25g dark chocolate, cut into roughly 1cm piecesGrease and line the base and sides of a 24cm x 34cm swiss roll tin.Put the butter in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat and leave to bubble away until it smells nutty and has turned an amber colour – about seven minutes. Turn off the heat and immediately add the marshmallows, vanilla extract, sesame oil and salt, and stir continuously for about a minute, until completely melted and smooth. Stir in the Rice Krispies, sesame seeds and halva until everything is combined and all the cereal is coated in marshmallow.Spread out in the prepared tin and, using a spatula, press the mixture down and into the corners, then smooth the top. Leave to cool until set, about an hour, before stamping out into shapes with a cutter.To decorate the ghosts, put the white chocolate in a small, heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water and stir occasionally until almost completely melted but with some visible chunks (these will melt in the residual heat). Take the bowl off the pan and let the chocolate cool, stirring occasionally. Pour the melted chocolate into a small piping bag or sandwich bag. Repeat with the dark chocolate, so you end up with two chocolate-filled bags.Snip a tiny hole at the end of the white chocolate bag, and pipe zigzag lines across the ghosts, to look like bandages. Snip a tiny hole in the dark chocolate bag and pipe two small dots on each ghost face, for eyes. Leave to set at room temperature for about an hour, or for 10 minutes in the fridge.Making honeycomb can seem a bit daunting, especially if you have little experience of working with sugar, but as long as you read the recipe carefully and measure everything out beforehand, it isn’t really hard at all. The feet keep for up to five days at room temperature in an airtight container. 50g water60g runny honey110g glucose300g caster sugar1 tbsp bicarbonate of sodaTo decorate200g dark, milk or white chocolate20g flaked almonds andor pumpkin seeds, lightly toastedGrease and line the base and sides of a 30cm x 20cm high-sided baking tin. Have a metal whisk at the ready.Combine the water, honey, glucose and sugar in a large saucepan, and gently stir together with a heatproof spatula until just combined – do not stir too much, otherwise the sugar might crystallise. Put the pan on a medium-high heat, bring to a gentle boil, then cook without stirring for eight to 10 minutes, until light amber in colour and smelling prominently of honey. If the mix colours unevenly, gently and slowly swirl the pan in a circular motion.Take off the heat and immediately whisk in the bicarb until thoroughly combined. Take care when doing this, because the sugar mixture will bubble and rise up rapidly. Quickly but carefully pour the mixture into the prepared baking tin, letting the mix even out by itself – do not be tempted to spread it out, because this will cause the honeycomb to deflate. Leave to cool completely – about an hour.Use the tip of a knife to cut the honeycomb into roughly 6cm shards – do not use your hands, because the honeycomb will crumble.Break the chocolate into pieces and place in a small bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water. Stirring occasionally, leave the chocolate until it’s almost completely melted but with some visible chocolate chunks (they will melt in the residual heat). Take the bowl off the pan and let the chocolate cool down, stirring from time to time, until cool to the touch. Half-dip the honeycomb pieces in the chocolate, shaking off any excess. Stick five flaked almonds or pumpkin seeds along the shorter edge of the honeycomb, to look like toenails – then leave to set completely, about 30 minutes.Use Pink Lady apples for a more vibrant colour and tangy flavour, or ambrosia for a more custardy result. To save time, replace the crumbs with roasted, chopped salty nuts.For the pumpkin caramel200g caster sugar 150ml double cream, at room temperature60g unsalted butter, at room temperature and roughly chopped into 3cm cubes100g pumpkin puree¾ tsp ground cinnamon1 tsp flaked sea saltFor the rye crumbs25g unsalted butter2-3 slices rye sourdough, crusts removed, bread roughly crumbled (100g)35g soft light brown sugar¼ tsp ground ginger6 cardamom pods, shells discarded and seeds finely ground in a mortar¼ tsp flaked sea saltFor the apples6 Pink Lady or ambrosia apples30g unsalted butter, at room temperature30g soft light brown sugar90g soured cream, to serveHeat the oven to 165C330Fgas 3¼. Put a medium saucepan on a medium-high flame and, once hot, add a third of the caster sugar – it will begin to melt as soon as it hits the pan. Give it a stir and, once completely melted, add a third more and repeat. Repeat with the final third of sugar and cook until it has all turned amber – about four minutes. Off the heat, slowly whisk in the cream and butter – it will sputter as it emulsifies into the sauce. Return the pan to a medium-low heat and whisk in the pumpkin, cinnamon and salt until completely smooth – about two minutes – then set aside.For the crumbs, melt the butter in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat. Add the bread and sugar, and cook, stirring continuously, for six minutes, until they begin to take on some colour. Add the spices and salt, lower the heat to medium, and cook for six minutes, until deeply golden and slightly crisp. Spread out on a baking tray and leave to cool.Core the apples, then put them in a deep, 28cm x 18cm baking dish.Put the butter and sugar in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat and cook, stirring often, for about three minutes, until smooth. Pour over the apples and bake: 30 minutes if using Pink Lady 45-50 minutes for ambrosia. You want the apples to be soft and cooked through, but still retain their shape.Return the caramel to a medium-high heat and warm for a few minutes. Divide the apples and their liquid between six plates. Pour caramel into the centre of each apple, top with a spoon of soured cream then the crumbs, and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef768183531f0beadfa77c3153d108138f4a5732/0_0_5095_3056/master/5095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a59e5c0814a7a866ee9a7c7b9cbaa2","title":"erik lamela happy tottenham hotspur form of his life","story":"Érik Lamela has started only one Premier League game this season yet he has scored three goals in the competition and the statistic raises an obvious question: is he happy with the amount of time he is getting on the field?The Tottenham winger, who has also scored in the Champions League against Barcelona and the Carabao Cup against Watford, is in arguably the form of his life, although he does not see it that way. He considers the question with his usual calm and he goes hard in one direction. “I am very satisfied and very happy,” Lamela says. “I have no reason to complain. I am playing as much as I expected to and I am happy with that. It is just the beginning of the season.”Lamela is not a guy to rock the boat by sounding off in the press but there is something deeper that underpins his attitude and eye-catching start to the season. By his own admission, he is enjoying his football more and he is drinking in every drop of it.Lamela’s new-found perspective is rooted in the 13-month injury layoff that he endured from October 2016. He had doubts over whether he would get back to his best levels and, as somebody who cannot be without football, it was a dreadfully testing time. But Lamela told himself to remain focused, to work day by day and after feeling his way back towards form last season he has taken a palpable step up this time out, albeit – as he repeatedly points out – he has played only nine times in all competitions. He hopes to make it 10 in the showpiece fixture against Manchester City at Wembley on Monday night.“In terms of differences between then and now, I think the big difference is that I’m enjoying things much more than I used to,” Lamela says. “After all the time I spent off the pitch, wishing that I could play again, now I enjoy everything. I enjoy every single training session and, perhaps, I enjoy things more because I’m in a different frame of mind. Perhaps, in the past, I was just going too fast and passing things by.”Lamela’s single-mindedness has always been his greatest strength and he has poured himself into making the difference whenever called upon this season. On as a substitute against Liverpool in mid-September, he scored in stoppage time and almost inspired a smash-and-grab draw. He was Tottenham’s best player in the Barcelona defeat and, again, on his lone league start, against West Ham last Saturday, when he scored the only goal.Lamela’s increased cutting edge has not been the only thing to thrust him to prominence. He looks sharper, quicker to the ball, more willing to drive at opponents and get himself into dangerous areas. Meanwhile, he remains an aggressive hustler without the ball.“I am feeling really well right now and I’m at the level where I wanted to be,” Lamela says. “I don’t think I am in the best form I’ve ever been in. I have started the season very well but you cannot get obsessed by the figures because it is still only the beginning. It is a question of taking it simply. I think there’s more to come from me, although I don’t like to get too far ahead of myself.”Lamela can see the broader picture when it comes to City. After Pep Guardiola joined the club as the manager his first defeat came at White Hart Lane in October 2016, when Spurs out-fought and out-thought them en route to a 2-0 win. Later in the season, the teams drew 2-2 at the Etihad in a game that City shaded.Yet last season, Spurs saw City lengthen their stride. Guardiola’s team beat them 4-1 at home and 3-1 at Wembley – the second result all but ensuring their coronation as champions. It feels as if the gap between the clubs is getting bigger and yet Tottenham would go above City with victory on Monday – a remarkable detail given how they have flattered to deceive at times this season.Spurs have repeatedly found a way to win on the domestic front and, with seven wins in nine games, they have made their best ever start to a Premier League campaign. But they have also flirted with crisis on more than one occasion, with Wednesday’s 2-2 Champions League draw at PSV Eindhoven ushering the dark clouds back overhead. Even Mauricio Pochettino said that, with one point from an available nine, they were unlikely to qualify for the last 16.“The Champions League matches have been defined by very small details that have changed everything,” Lamela says. “We’ve not had much luck, although I’m not trying to find excuses. We’ve not managed to close down matches as we should have done at Inter Milan and Eindhoven.“With City, we’ll definitely try to close the gap on them. We start every season with victory in mind. They are a great, great team but this is a huge opportunity to get ahead of them. The good thing is we’re playing locally, we’ll have our people there supporting us and we’re going to go for the win. We’re going to try and stay on that streak of victories that we’ve been having in the Premier League.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/049e0be91e045c120681b2c84fa021ac78d3ec9d/0_264_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1105c98c317ed967078eac6501a6b060","title":"raul sanllehi vinai venkatesham arsenal interview","story":"The new director of football, Raúl Sanllehí, and managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, talk about the club’s burning ambitionsGiven the modern form of communication that links Arsenal’s most senior executives, it would not have been a surprise for the ping of a WhatsApp message to reverberate in the director’s box at the Emirates in the seconds after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mesut Özil hurtled off in celebration of a goal against Leicester last Monday that got everyone talking. Stan Kroenke and his son Josh are in a WhatsApp group with a select group of Arsenal’s top management figures and it is not unusual for them to share transatlantic messages in the middle of a game.Raúl Sanllehí and Vinai Venkatesham have the fleeting look of men who wonder about the wisdom of dropping details of an intriguing source of communication into conversation. “You have got into a hole, my friend,” Sanllehí jokes to his partner in the new Arsenal leadership team. But it is a sign of the new direction in which they are pushing that they naturally transmit a flow of openness and enthusiasm – a stronger human touch.If Unai Emery is trying to breathe freshness into Arsenal on the pitch, Sanllehí, director of football, and Venkatesham, managing director, are seizing the opportunity to bring a burst of new energy at executive level. These two men have been promoted to share the duties Ivan Gazidis will pass over at the end of the month when he moves to Milan. Are two heads better than one? That depends on how well the two heads get along and Sanllehí and Venkatesham are excited about pooling their expertise.Sanllehí, recruited from Barcelona last January, brings the football connections. Venkatesham, an organiser on the 2012 London Olympics, leads the business side. Returning Arsenal to the Champions League as quickly as possible crops up repeatedly as phase one of their ambitions.Of course that is easier said than done, particularly when promoting a self-sustaining model in an environment where some rival football clubs are backed by the generosity of sovereign wealth funds. Venkatesham understands the scepticism. “I’d completely get that, if there was one team who was winning the league every year by 20 points who had a completely different model to the rest. But that’s not what I’m seeing generally in the Premier League. That’s not what’s happening.”Sanllehí preaches the ideal of wringing every last drop out of their assets to try to achieve in a different way. “We need to be very, very efficient in the design of the first team. We need to be very efficient in the way we play and the way we generate the income to put more fuel into the machine. Your level is not only a case of how much you can pay your players,” he argues.“We need to regain that positioning, that privilege, to be seen as a Champions League club. From there the wheel starts rolling again. That is what is going to give us the speed, also to be attractive to better players, to generate more money. It is the virtuous circle.”On the back of an 11-game winning run, are they ahead of schedule? Sanllehí defers to a Spanish maxim: paso a paso – step by step. “Unanimously everybody thinks the expectation should be the shorter the better, of course. Unai would not accept anything less than going for Champions League right now on his own expectation.“I don’t want with this to put on additional pressure because we want to go in the right direction and sometimes – as he always says – paso a paso. We’re in a great streak of victories, hopefully it will last longer. The longer the better. But we know there are going to be ups and downs this season. Getting to the Champions League is one of the main objectives. But Unai would not settle for that. He would go higher. Not to over-promise and not to put extra pressure on him. But he’s going all the way.”As they talk the sun is streaming into the boardroom that overlooks the first-team training pitch at Arsenal’s London Colney. It is part of the structural reshuffling that the executive team have offices at both the training ground and the Emirates (where it has not gone unnoticed that Venkatesham has kept his desk within the open plan workspace rather than take the formal room upstairs, as he prefers to mix and talk to people).This reshuffle coincides with a radical period of change at Arsenal. In addition to Emery, numerous support staff came in and out around the time of Arsène Wenger’s departure, and Kroenke Sports \u0026amp Entertainment is formalising a full takeover of the shares. That is not a universally popular move with open, plural ownership now lost and the key question about annual interest payments resulting from the takeover being funded by £557m of borrowed money a continuing concern.But Sanllehí offers an alternative view about full ownership – as if the Kroenkes might have been holding something back during the standoff with the other main shareholder of recent years, Alisher Usmanov. “The commitment and engagement from the Kroenkes was very clearly stated several times in our recent visit. Now with full ownership that commitment has grown to a higher stage. They are sports-passionate people and they like to win.”The relationship with the Kroenkes is clearly important, and joking aside the WhatsApp group serves a purpose. Lines of communication are kept open. Venkatesham says: “If there is a decision to be made or a question that needs answering and we need to get hold of Josh and Stan, they are on, available and engaged whenever we want to get them. We don’t have the formality of a conference call every other day to talk about things because we don’t really see the benefit of that. Football moves so quickly you can have a conference call on Wednesday morning and then on Wednesday afternoon there is an issue and we need to talk to the guys.”So what might happen if an extraordinary opportunity, something exceptional outside the normal self-sustaining model, dropped into their laps? Would they take that to the Kroenkes and might they be receptive? Could they push for greater input?“They would definitely listen,” Sanllehí says. “What they have proved to us is that they are extremely reasonable and that they are passionate about this project. We talk constantly and they are very intelligent people. If there is a very clear opportunity we would definitely talk to them about it.”Venkatesham smiles. “The one thing I wish I could do is show you the WhatsApp group.” Naturally, though, while they get on with the serious business of running Arsenal, such tantalising detail must be left to our imagination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dabfd018dee0b2c47e9b96bd316ab88f3dfc7c42/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0221c1f91d4ae4885b00017fef9892ee","title":"how the world smiles secret to collective happiness helen russell","story":"Optimism is more necessary than ever, and understanding how other cultures approach life’s trials and joys may help us achieve contentmentIf you read the paper or look at the news online without becoming depressed about the state of humanity – or make it through your social media feeds before your mood lurches to despair – well done you. You are a beautiful anomaly. For everyone else: huddle in. It’s tough out there and it can be easy to get the idea that the world is getting more miserable by the minute, that we’re all becoming more isolationist and that these are bleak times indeed. Because when things are ticking along nicely, there’s very little to report. Negativity bias means that, as human beings, we experience “bad” events more intensely than we do the “good” – and we also remember them more. So we have to work hard to remain hopeful – or we can’t make things better.Optimism isn’t frivolous: it’s necessary. If we feel hopeless all the time, if we’re always in crisis, the natural response is to give up and stop trying altogether. But we can’t let snark or apathy win. We can be aware of the bad whilst being mindful of how we can make it better. And there are people all around the world finding meaning and happiness every day, both in countries that top the global happiness surveys and in those that don’t.Since I started researching what constitutes happiness in different countries, I’ve been inspired by testimonies about the unique cultural concepts that constitute “a good life”. Of course, definitions of “happiness” vary and metrics to measure contentment also differ. Thailand, for example, has been ranked the least miserable country out of 66 economies for the fourth year running in Bloomberg’s Misery Index. The UN World Happiness Report for 2018 put the Nordic nations in the top four slots as usual, based on healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom, trust and generosity.Canada, America’s more socially liberal neighbour, has ranked among the happiest nations since the report was first published in 2012, thanks to a generous helping of joie de vivre – especially in Quebec, the French-speaking province. Quebeckers are so happy that were Quebec a nation, it would be second only to Denmark in international rankings (when tasked with explaining why, Quebeckers proffer something along the lines of: “It’s because we’re French, but you know, not France French.” What other nation would describe an orgasm as “a little death”?).Canadians also have a good welfare state and an outdoorsy lifestyle, but what sets them apart from similar cultures is an emphasis on inclusiveness. Multiculturalism is regularly cited as one of Canada’s biggest achievements and the ability to celebrate difference is a distinguishing feature. The Canadian mindset has been heavily influenced by First Nation ideas of equality and instead of crushing aboriginal values, Canada embraced them. Canadians cottoned on to the idea that we’re all richer from a plurality of voices – and that opening up your social circle to welcome in new people and celebrate ersity is a pretty good life plan.There’s also a wealth of ideas from countries that don’t feature on any official lists. Brazil, the country of carnival, football and nuts, has a word for the absence of happiness: saudade, used to describe the feeling of longing for happiness that once was. The term was popularised in the 15th century when Portuguese ships sailed to Africa and Asia and those left behind felt the loss of loved ones. The Portuguese colonised Brazil in the 16th century and the word was taken up by settlers to remember the homeland they’d left behind – a concept now so celebrated in Brazil that it has its own day, on 30 January each year.Researchers from the University of New South Wales have found that accepting and allowing for temporary sadness in this way helps improve attention to detail, increases perseverance, promotes generosity and makes us appreciate what we’ve got. Saudade teaches us that a degree of melancholy in life is inevitable – desirable, even – and something to be savoured rather than ignored. No one can be carnival-happy all the time and the lows help us appreciate the highs.The Thai concept of mai pen rai, or “it doesn’t matter, don’t worry”, reminds us to maintain perspective. Hyperbole is so widespread in today’s society – especially on social media – that if we don’t “love” something it’s assumed we must “hate” it. Only real life isn’t like that. There are myriad shades of grey that we’d all do well to acknowledge before galloping to outrage. A mai pen rai approach dictates that instead of striving all the time for more, the way we live life now is good enough and that “walking the middle ground” is the route to happiness, a theory upheld by researchers from the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. Rest is important, too. Dolce far niente – or the sweetness of doing nothing – is a much treasured concept in Italy that’s seldom spoken out loud but is often hashtagged on Instagram, accompanying pictures of Italians in hammocks. Italy doesn’t top any happiness rankings, but the cliché of the carefree Italian exists with good reason. Italians do “nothing” like no other nation and perfecting the art takes style and skill. It’s watching the world go by over coffee and gelato. It’s laughing at tourists. Or politicians. It’s savouring the moment and really enjoying the present.In Turkey, keyif – or the pursuit of idle pleasure – keeps locals sane and sanguine in turbulent times. Inactivity feels like an act of transgression for many in Europe where the Protestant work ethic is alive and well and held up as a goal for all. And yet when we make time to rest, we have the energy and the reserves to partake in civic debatewash the cardeal with a tax return.Another wellspring for a happy life worldwide is resilience – proven to increase immunity and reduce stress. The unofficial motto for Icelanders and wannabe Vikings everywhere – Þetta reddast – roughly translates as “it will be all right” and has come to represent the unwavering belief that everything will work out in the end. Since Icelanders have made their home in such an inhospitable landscape, it’s a belief that helps them score highly on happiness polls even in sub-zero temperatures.In India, meanwhile, jugaad – meaning frugal innovation, a “hack”, or an attitude and commitment to getting things done, no matter how – has long helped Indians make the best of what they’ve got in hugely challenging circumstances.Some of the themes that emerged while researching my book were universal – such as time with family and friends, having a hobby, taking the pressure off at work, or engaging with nature – but others were more profound. The Bantu term ubuntu means “I find my worth in you and you find your worth in me”, a sense of interconnection and the belief in a bond or sharing that connects all humanity. Bantu is spoken in Central Africa, Southern Africa and the African Great Lakes region, but ubuntu has been claimed by South Africa as a humanitarian objective to live by. In the 1990s, it became a guiding light for the anti-apartheid movement and even appears in South Africa’s Interim Constitution.Nelson Mandela led with ubuntu and it drove archbishop Desmond Tutu’s work as chairman of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Ubuntu urges us to care more, asserting that to be happy, we have to make sure others are, too. Even the people we don’t know. Even when it hurts. As Tutu said: “I am sorry to say that suffering is not optional.” So forget Descartes’ “I think therefore I am,” it’s time for a new philosophical bumper sticker: “I am because you are.” Rested and resilient, with our compassion levels restored, we can take action and make things better for everyone. That way, we’ll all be happier – long term. The Atlas of Happiness by Helen Russell is published by Two Roads at £16.99 on 1 November.

Jimi Famurewa reportsThe British pub may be a byword for hospitality – roaring fires, inviting booths, glinting bottles – but it’s a welcome that has not always extended to immigrants. From the “colour bars” of the 1950s and 60s to the Essex pub landlord who, earlier this year, refused to remove an array of ornamental golliwogs from his establishment, ethnic minorities have, historically speaking, had good reason to approach this bastion of British culture warily.But there is another, lesser-heard story about pubs and the BAME community. Ever since 1965 – when Oliver “George” Berry took over Brixton’s Coach \u0026amp Horses pub and became London’s first black licensee – non-white Brits have been taking control of the spaces from which they were once excluded, often transforming them into vital cultural hubs in the process.Today, this tradition continues with Jamaican-run bars, rural gastropubs under the stewardship of African-born chefs and the Desi pubs of the Midlands which serve delicious Punjabi cooking to buck the general downturn in the trade.It’s even getting the sitcom treatment, in the form of Romesh Ranganathan’s The Reluctant Landlord, inspired by his Sri Lankan family’s time running a Sussex pub, which starts on Sky1 this week.So what are the unique challenges these landlords and landladies face? How do they balance the demands of thirsty students and first-generation immigrants looking for a taste of home? Here, five publicans share the view from behind the bar.This was the first pub I worked in, doing Sunday shifts in the early 1980s because a friend of my family drank here. It was owned by an African man called Nelson. He was one of the people who led the trend around here for black people to want to own pubs. He showed that it was achievable. If you’d just come here from Jamaica, the Golden Anchor was a place you could come in, meet family and friends, and maybe get work in the building trade. On the other hand, I remember walking into pubs in Bermondsey at that time and being the only black person there.By 1998, Nelson had passed away and the new landlords, who were Jamaican, were looking for someone to take over as the licensee. When I started, there were drug boys who effectively ran the pub it was why the other people had given it up. They would be getting their clients in here, not buying drinks. It wasn’t nice at all, but I had to front them out, little me against those boys. My brother helped me and, with some prayers, we got rid of them.Our Caribbean food and music is a big reason people come here. And if we stopped the dominoes, there’d be trouble. We had to move the game from one room to another recently, and the men who play created such a fuss, threatening a boycott. They’ve been playing here for more than 20 years: we know what they’re going to drink, how hot they like their soup. They see it as home, and when they’re dancing on a Saturday night to our DJs, that makes me happy.In all the time I’ve been here, we were never “a Caribbean pub” or “a Jamaican pub” in my mind. It was only when I heard people referring to us that way that I realised it was how people viewed us. But we can’t run this place for one group of people.Obviously the area has changed and, from late 2016 until May last year, we had a pop-up bar in the basement, Little Nan’s Tropical Den, offering kitsch decorations and serving cocktails in teacups. There are young white people who love the food, know what they want and what it should taste like.It’s important to me that they know they’re welcome, that we’re not just a black pub. Everyone is welcome.In 1993, I was 32, selling tools at the market and drinking here. The landlord at the time had fallen out with the brewery and decided to leave. One of the barmen said I should go for it, so I went to Weston-super-Mare to do a British Institute of Innkeeping course, interviewed with Holden’s Brewery and got the tenancy not long after. It was hard work at first. There was a barman who was stealing from me, but I kept him on long enough that he could show me how a cellar worked, teach me about cask beers and what have you.When I took over, there was no food at all it was a watering hole. But when the smoking ban came in, it killed the pub – trade dropped by about three grand a week – so a lot of the Desi pubs started opening kitchens. We started with tandoori chicken from a tent in the yard in 2003 and escalated to a proper chef in 2007. Now everybody wants to eat Indian food. It makes me laugh because when I used to work as an attendant at the swimming baths when I was 19, people would go, “Eurgh, you smell of garlic!”In the old days, we would get people coming to the pub and trying to intimidate us. I can’t say whether it was about race, but we dealt with it ourselves. If they wanted it, we gave it to them. It was like a cowboy film you don’t get the sheriff, you just carry on punching.These days, because of the food, my clientele has changed from a strong Asian base to a strong white British base. Sometimes I’ll bar an English fella for not behaving and he’ll say, “You’re racist.” But this is a business. It’s not somewhere you come and mess about. In its time, the pub has welcomed young, old, Irish, black, Asian. The stigma of racism has gone in Smethwick. And we Asian landlords bear no grudges.Before taking over here in late 2015, I could probably count the number of pubs I had been into on one hand. I’m originally from Nigeria, but I moved here to study and met my English partner. My background was in business, but I did culinary courses and, in 2011, started a business called Kidderminster Catering. I started looking for cheffing jobs, but they tend to mean working evenings and weekends, and I wanted to be there for my kids, who are now 11 and eight. That was when the pub came up, and I thought it was a fantastic way to showcase my food while also being together as a family.We live in the pub, so I haven’t needed babysitters. The children like being able to grab sweets and drinks from the bar. And my daughter gave the customers a laugh once when she came down in her pyjamas, thinking we were closed.At first, running the pub was challenging. We decided to open on New Year’s Eve 2015, which I now know is the worst time. Oh, my God. Before we even opened the door, there were people queueing on the main road and everything that could go wrong went wrong. The draught line stopped working, 200 people were waiting to be served, the tills broke. In the end, we just stopped charging people. It was a disaster, but I learned from it. If my front of house walked out tomorrow, I could clean my own draught lines, and tell you how a pint of beer should taste.This is an affluent, rural, white area, so I’m probably the only black person in town. But food offers common ground. People who would never have gone into an African-Caribbean restaurant come in here. There are people who a year ago would have said, “The thought of eating goat makes me want to puke.” Now, they’re sucking goat juices out of the bone and asking for really hot spice. That makes me so happy.I don’t forget my African history or where I come from. I’ve had people come in and say something racist, so I’ve given them some facts about black history. My husband always says, “If anyone wants to say anything bad about black people, she’ll have your head on a plate.” One guy was talking about immigrants, saying they just claim benefits and so on. I told him, “You can leave now.” I actually had to drag him out. People think that because you’re a woman or you’re black, they can walk all over you. No way.I came to this country from India in 2003 – as a student of public administration – and became a pub landlord in 2010. There was a lot of hard work in between. When I first arrived, I worked in an Asian supermarket during the day and a bar at night. Some days, I would work for almost 20 hours. The best way to stay awake was to not drink alcohol. Energy drinks, coffee – I don’t like those things.I think it was around 2008 that I decided I wanted to start a business, become a shopkeeper or something like that. But when I looked at it, I decided a pub would be easier and I liked the concept of Indian food in a British-style pub.In 2012, I started the play area – the Paw Ways – because it was very hard for me to bring families back to the pub. Some regulars weren’t happy with it, but I told them, “This is my pub now and I’m going to do what I want with it.” It’s got fibreglass animals – giraffes, dinosaurs, a crocodile – that I went to Devon to collect myself. I’ll keep on adding as many as I can.In our trade now, the biggest problem is staffing. It’s hard to find and keep good chefs because a lot of Indian people in the area are now buying pubs. They think it’s a money-growing tree, but it’s not. They don’t see the pain behind the story.If I’m paying my chef £300 and somebody says to him, “I’ll pay you £350 if you come to me”, then he’s gone and that’s a big problem.But I’ve got a good team and I’m proud of myself. I came to this country with no English and now I’m running a pub.This place used to be a music venue, and I remember when we first came to look around in 2014, the estate agent warned us that it was in a bad state. I thought, how bad could it be? But my God, it was disgusting. It smelled of puke and God knows what else the toilet was smashed to bits.It made sense to make the Caribbean aspect of the bar – the food, the music – our unique selling point. I didn’t want to go into any areas I wasn’t familiar with. Caribbeans aren’t really big on ales, so we don’t sell them. We focus on cocktails and rum instead. Another thing we brought in was our “Rastaman” mannequin. It was originally a statue of a blond-haired surfer guy that we asked a company to turn into a rasta he basically just looks like a white guy with a tan. Some students stole him one night and another idiot punched his arm off, but he’s still standing, just about.We’re not tied to a brewery or company, so I think we’re the first independent, black-owned bar in Sheffield. I’m only 25, but I’ve grown into being a landlord.There are strange moments, though. We’ve had customers come in who have assumed that one of my white staff members is the owner. On the other hand, I’ve had some black customers say, “Oh, there are too many white people here.” My response is always, why does it make a difference? We get a good mixture of white British people and Caribbean people, and we try to balance both.I also want to use Blues to start a black enterprise scheme. I got the taste for running my own business when I opened a cafe as part of my business and accounting degree. I had grown up with lots of moneymaking schemes – making beats and selling them to people, hiring my bedroom out as a studio. But as a young black guy, you’re probably less likely to be given a loan from the bank to start a business. I want to use funds from special nights to give minority people in Sheffield that helping hand, whether it’s assistance with a business plan, DJing apprenticeships or even helping a young barber rent a chair in a barbershop. It’s important to me that this is a place that helps the culture and the community.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61efeff56e2a21897721fe049dbab54c01321aa/0_70_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78fa2d5ab1c0dc160d517717ccb7960c","title":"photojournalist steve mccurry a life in pictures","story":"A new book, Steve McCurry: A Life in Pictures, compiled by the photographer’s sister Bonnie McCurry, captures his iconic images, from his early work in the US to his journey into Afghanistan hidden among the mujahideen, coverage of the 1991 Gulf war and 911, and more recent work"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a2754c044cfd54825e2771536be8c263827a34/19_0_1703_1022/master/1703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a903998f1b86d5c95a7b4378056b6e6","title":"weinstein ex assistant ban workplace non disclosure agreements","story":"Zelda Perkins says debate over her ex-boss and Philip Green highlights need for changeHarvey Weinstein’s former assistant Zelda Perkins has called on the UK government to urgently ban the use of non-disclosure agreements in the workplace following the Sir Philip Green allegations.Perkins, the most high-profile example of an inidual breaking an NDA drawn up between lawyers and powerful clients over allegations of sexual harassment, said the debate surrounding Green highlighted the need for the agreements to be made illegal.Perkins claimed she had been prevented from speaking out after alleging sexual assault against the film producer. She had thought her only option was to sign an NDA.Perkins, who worked for Weinstein’s Miramax Films in London during the 1990s, claims Weinstein “sexually assaulted and attempted to rape a colleague of mine”.Green was named in parliament on Thursday as the leading businessman accused by the  of sexual and racial harassment. Peter Hain, who identified him in the Lords, said he was using parliamentary privilege to circumvent NDAs used “to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying”.Perkins has now called for NDAs to be made illegal when used to cover up any type of crime committed in the workplace.“In an employment environment there isn’t any reason, or any time, when they are acceptable,” she said. “I know people shout out that it protects the victim as well, but it only protects the victim because of the current climate. There shouldn’t be any shame or fear about calling out bad behaviour, but at the moment the environment is skewed to help the perpetrator.”The government is reportedly considering prohibiting NDAs about sexual harassment in the workplace, but Perkins called for the ban to be much wider.“It shouldn’t just be that NDAs are banned around sexual harassment, it’s about discrimination, it’s about race, environmental accidents, it’s about people in power.“This about a whole cultural, social attitude change. If you’re in a position of power, part of the deal that you make when you have a lot of power is that actually you should be acting more responsibly than anybody else. Historically it’s always been like this, once people become powerful they think they are above everything.”Green has “categorically and wholly” denied allegations of “unlawful sexual or racist behaviour”. Lawyers for Weinstein have said the film producer “categorically denies engaging in any non-consensual conduct or alleged threatening behaviour”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26ff3d5b40970d91da89f2d3ca2a353a4ac1d429/0_77_4890_2933/master/4890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e03201e062ee1b23c17c443e51cb268","title":"the story of us how the inflated anzac myth obscures our national identity","story":"In this extract from his book On Patriotism, Paul Daley traces the arc of a once quiet and dignified commemoration to a modern sound-and-light showThe story of who we are – of where we came from and of the trails blazed by our ancestors – is everything. Even in my primary school years beginning in 1969, as our older siblings and cousins were burning draft cards and marching in the streets against Australia’s part in another imperial war, Vietnam, Anzac already seemed secure, though not nearly as ostentatiously so as today, in our slowly evolving national narrative.In 1964, the year of my birth, Donald Horne sketched in his polemic The Lucky Country a lackadaisical Australia, neither boldly republican nor imperialist. He wrote that thanks, perhaps, to the rise and defeat of European fascism, nationalism “is now so hesitant that it no longer achieves self-definition. No one any longer tells Australians who they are, nor do they seem to care”.“The very lack of any definite nationalism, of statements on who Australians are and where they stand in history, cannot be wholeheartedly deplored in an age that has seen so much horror and cruelty unleashed in the name of nationalism,” he wrote.National birth had, it seemed, not only skipped 60,000-plus years of Indigenous continental habitation, it had also failed to incorporate Federation in 1901, an event that almost 12 decades later still sits in the outer stalls of public consciousness as little more than a big Coag meeting with beards.Anzac Day, Horne reckoned, was “an expression of the commonness of man (even death is a leveller), of the necessity for sticking together in adversity ... It is not a patriotic day but ... a ‘tribal festival’, the folk seeing itself as it is – unpretentious and comradely”.All the original Anzacs have gone. Most of their children are in their seventies and eighties, their grandchildren in their fifties and sixties. After my generation passes, there will be no living Australian memory of the soldiers who fought in World War I –nobody left to remember the ageing Anzacs on the trams, ferries and buses, worse for wear but for the most part dignified after commemorating together at their modest sunrise services before carrying on to play two-up in parks and pubs across Australia on their one day of the year.Their lives will be rendered with ever less human complexity, to become more storied and honed by an already vast army of mythologists. They will be further rendered soldier white hats who either stoically endured or who gave national birth while dying in battle, all the while bequeathing us fellow countrymen and women with supposedly unique characteristics of courage, ingenuity and mateship – traits that EuropeanAustralian myth has overlooked in all its enemies from the Ottomans, Germans and Japanese to the tens of thousands of Indigenous warriors and civilians slaughtered right here in the name of white settlement.Back when Horne wrote his book, there was no rolling TV coverage of, and elaborate commentary on, the Anzac parades in the capital cities, events that lured a few thousand people in the sixties and seventies. Perhaps two or three hundred would turn up for the dawn services at the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne and the Australian War Memorial in Canberra – where crowds of 35,000 and 50,000, respectively, fronted on Anzac Day 2018.But then again, 25 April 2018 represented peak Anzac – three-quarter time in a 51-month, $600m carnival of Australian World War I commemoration that ends on 11 November: Remembrance Day. What was, when Horne wrote his 1964 book, a day of folksy, thoughtful reflection has been transformed into a permanent commemorative sound-and-light show. Any capacity for quiet reflection on the 62,000 who died in World War I, or the 102,000 defence personnel who’ve perished in all of this country’s overseas operations, has been drowned out amid the type of boisterous jingoism and exclusive you-flew-here-we-grew-here style of nationalism that has imbued Australia Day with ever greater potency since the 1988 bicentenary.Australia’s spending on commemoration during the four years of Anzac 100 (this country’s official commemorative program) has dwarfed that of other participant nations in World War I, even though other countries experienced many more combatant and civilian deaths. Australia has spent the equivalent of almost $9,000 for every soldier killed, compared with far lower spending by the United Kingdom ($110m, or $109 on each of its 1.01 million dead), New Zealand ($31m, or $1,713 on each of its 18,100 soldiers killed) and Germany (2.8 million fatalities, $6m total, $2 on each).In the decades after the Great War, the returned services organisations had greater affinity with the conservative side of parliament. Today, no political party monopolises commemoration. Consecutive Labor and Coalition governments and their leaders over the past three-and-a-half decades (with the exception of Paul Keating) have increasingly clung to and conflated the Anzac myth with national foundation and identity. Anzac 100 has flourished, the ridiculous commitments to its funding announced, bolstered or unchallenged under prime ministers Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Rudd again, Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and now Scott Morrison.In 2015, the historian Peter Cochrane wrote, “Drape ‘Anzac’ over an argument and, like a magic cloak, the argument is sacrosanct”. A long tradition of obscurant political bipartisanship has protected Anzac’s mythology and funding. It still shrouds Anzac with immunity from scrutiny over all manner of things – from the questionable proposition that Gallipoli is the foundry of the nation and its character, to the acceptance by Anzac’s shrine, the Australian War Memorial, of funding from weapons manufacturers to commemorate our dead in foreign conflicts, while stubbornly ignoring the frontier wars that claimed, by some estimations, more Indigenous lives on this very continent than those of Australian soldiers killed between 1914 and 1918.This is an edited extract from On Patriotism by Paul Daley, out 29 October from MUP.

The amendment, if passed, will state that acceptance of the prime minister’s deal must be dependent on a public vote taking place beforehand, in which people would be offered the choice of leaving on the terms of that deal, or staying in the EU.The group, led by the Tory MP and former GP Sarah Wollaston, is determined to maintain the momentum from last weekend’s march through London by 700,000 people in favour of a people’s vote, by showing remainers that MPs in all the main parties are prepared to fight for them in parliament.Wollaston is working with a team of two other GPs – the Tory MP Phillip Lee and Labour’s Paul Williams – and the SNP’s Philippa Whitford, who is a surgeon. They are particularly concerned by the effect Brexit will have on the NHS but warn it will also be a catastrophe for the economy and jobs.They believe the move has the backing of more than 100 MPs, and that they have a chance of pushing the amendment through if the Labour leadership shifts position and whips its MPs in favour of a second vote.A senior Labour figure who backs the move said: “There are some supporters of a second referendum who think the main push should come later, amid the chaos that would ensue from May’s deal failing to get through parliament or a no-deal. But we believe a killer amendment like this could be our only chance. We cannot afford to miss it.”The prospect of such a vote will increase the pressure on the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who would prefer a general election to a second vote. A majority of his party members and activists want a second referendum, and most would prefer to stay in the EU rather than accept a poor Brexit deal.Wollaston, who spoke at the “people’s vote” march, said: “Without a second referendum vote on the final deal there is no informed consent to Brexit. The consequences will last for generations. Valid consent requires the government to set out the final version of Brexit and allow people to weigh up the risks and benefits.“Quite simply Brexit will be bad for health, science and the economy in ways that will touch all our lives. As a group of four current and former clinicians we feel that the principle of informed consent is as important when it comes to Brexit as it is to patients when weighing up the pros and cons of surgery.“People must have the right to look at the final plans, the evidence about consequences and have the opportunity to change their minds.”Williams said: “Before politicians make the biggest leap that this country will make in all of our lifetimes, we should check with people to make sure this is really, really what they want to do. We now know so much more than we did in 2016. Companies are stopping investments in the UK. NHS staff are leaving because they don’t feel welcome. Medical research collaboration with Europe is ending.“Our country will become poorer, have less influence and have less control with the type of Brexit deal that Theresa May is agreeing. Is this really a price worth paying?”Senior ministers confronted the prime minister last week over their suspicions that No 10 will agree a deal that they could never accept. At a stormy cabinet meeting on Tuesday, May was told there must now be the “closest possible political supervision” of the Brexit negotiations.Ministers demanded a full cabinet discussion, including an assessment by the chief whip, Julian Smith, and a legal ruling by attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, before Britain signs anything. The so-called “Irish backstop”, demanded by the EU and agreed to by May last year, would at the very least keep Northern Ireland tied into the EU’s customs and standards rules.Ireland’s EU commissioner, Phil Hogan, told May there was no chance the EU would back down on the issue. “Nobody should be in any doubt about the unity of the EU to ensure that the commitment to an operational backstop on the island of Ireland is honoured and included in the withdrawal agreement so that a hard border on the island of Ireland is avoided,” he told the Observer.In a hair-raising rundown of planning for a no-deal Brexit, Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, told colleagues he was looking at whether trade could be rerouted through Dutch and Belgian ports should the French take a “tough stance”. He said Britain was highly dependent on the Channel tunnel and said the private sector should “think creatively” to help solve the capacity problem at UK ports.On aviation, it was pointed out that while companies such as Ryanair could move their headquarters to keep planes flying between EU destinations, this was “not an option for British Airways”. It was also announced that the government was about to tender for warehouse space to store crucial medicines.Leaders of the SNP, the Greens, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats met the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels last week. In an article written after the talks, Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid’s leader at Westminster, and the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, said one message had been that Labour was now the main obstacle to another referendum.At its party conference earlier this month Labour said it would push for a general election in the event of Brexit chaos, but another referendum was an option if it could not force one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3172b0cdf9f3728f882e8008a8ac70279a1f3a3/446_22_4395_2637/master/4395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7407a486f1fce485ed04ff5cb3b24f39","title":"mega mission mars ancient life nasa rovers sample return","story":"American rocket engineers are being urged to push their next Mars mission to the limits of technological performance. Space scientists have told Nasa they want the agency to “dream big” to ensure their new robot rover, scheduled for launch in 2020, visits a maximum number of sites to increase chances of uncovering signs of ancient life on Mars.Rock samples – hopefully bearing fossils – would then be left in caches on the Martian surface, to be collected several years later and returned to Earth in a complex series of robot “sample return” missions costing more than $10bn.For this investment, the scientific community says it wants to have the strongest possible chance of finding signs of ancient Martian life – hence its call for the next robot rover to the red planet to visit the largest possible number of places where it can collect rocks, hopefully rich in fossils. However, it acknowledges this mission will push the robot vehicle to the very limits of its performance.“The community prefers a mega-mission,” said Bethany Ehlmann, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology, quoted in Nature this month. “If we are going to do a sample return, it has to be a sample cache for the ages.”The planet today has almost no atmosphere, no liquid water, and its surface is bombarded by intense radiation. “We now think the likelihood of life existing on its surface is slim to non-existent,” said Matthew Golombek, of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.So Nasa’s next Mars mission has been designed to answer the query: was there ever life on Mars?US scientists are concentrating on rocks formed in watery environments billions of years ago, when the planet was much more Earthlike. These rocks, as they formed, would have preserved remnants of any life that flourished before the planet’s atmosphere evaporated and its surface water boiled off.It will be the task of the next, as yet unnamed, Mars rover to drill into promising sediments, collect samples and place them in test tubes that will then be dumped in caches. The original proposal was to create one cache but, at a meeting this month, scientists pressed for several to be created.Three sites close to each other were pinpointed as being particularly promising andwere voted as favourites among scientists at the meeting in Glendale, California: these are known as Jezero crater, Northeast Syrtis and Midway. Jezero and Midway are thought to be most useful. However, the two sites are 17 miles apart. Nasa’s most advanced robot, Curiosity – a sister craft to the forthcoming rover – has travelled only 12 miles since it landed in 2012. “Creating two caches at Jezero and Midway would push our technology to the very limits,” Golombek admitted. “On the other hand, we need to make sure we get the best possible samples. We are going to have to work hard on this.”Around 2026, Nasa plans to launch a follow-up mission that would land a rocket launcher and new robot craft, called Fetch Rover, on Mars. Fetch Rover will gather up the caches and deliver them back to the rocket, which will then blast the samples into orbit round Mars. There it will rendezvous with an orbiter to carry the samples back to Earth.“We will have the strictest quarantine conditions enforced when we collect and store those samples,” said Golombek. “It will be worth the effort and expense, however. This is going to be our best chance of finding out if life evolved independently on another world and that life here is not just a lucky accident.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/096e0e0fc5f5f3284bd71e4c934f9049cab05c71/0_86_4950_2971/master/4950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3e02319aa73152c880a13bfdbb6de58","title":"daniel ricciardo mexican grand prix lewis hamilton f1","story":"• Red Bulls lock out front row of the grid in Mexico• Hamilton can seal world championship in Sunday’s raceThat Lewis Hamilton will clinch his fifth world championship in Mexico City on Sunday remains almost a certainty. Doing so with the celebratory flourish of victory however will require the British driver to be on absolutely top form after Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo claimed pole position, locking out the front row with his teammate Max Verstappen.If it is a race contested with the same fierce competition that defined a thrilling qualifying, it should at least prove to be a memorable meeting at which the British driver wraps up the title.Hamilton, despite some exceptional performances over the single lap this season, could manage only third on a track where the Mercedes has not been at its best. Crucially, however, his title rival Sebastian Vettel, who must win to keep his title hopes alive, was behind him in fourth.Hamilton requires a seventh place or better finish at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez to equal Juan Manuel Fangio’s five championships. He is under no pressure to force a win and will be able to manage his race accordingly. He has repeatedly played the percentages well this season and there is no reason he should not do so again to ensure the title.His biggest concern will be staying clear of trouble from the off – he was sent to the back of the field with a puncture when he clashed with Vettel’s Ferrari on the opening lap last year. Hamilton insisted he would not alter his approach from the start line, however. “If you go easy, you can get hit. If you go too aggressive, you can hit or still get hit,” he said. “You’ve got to race it like normal and go in for the win. That’s what I’m going to be doing. I mean, that’s what we’re here to do – to race.”The Red Bull’s form in long runs in practice suggests they will carry strong pace into the race and that they have every opportunity to take the win. The team principal, Christian Horner, confirmed his drivers would be allowed to race and, with this the best chance either has of a final win this season, their fight is likely to be uncompromising.Ricciardo was ecstatic at taking pole, having upset a narrative that had seemed almost inevitable. With Verstappen quickest in every practice session and on his first run in Q3, the Dutchman looked all set to claim the record for youngest ever pole-sitter. Ricciardo, however, refused to lie down and took pole with a superb lap on his second run in Q3 with a track record time of 1min 14.759sec. He had to be at his best to beat Verstappen, who was just two hundredths down. The Dutchman was visibly disappointed and complained his car had struggled with rear-locking during the session.Yet Ricciardo, whose two previous poles had both been at Monaco, had executed what was his lap of his season. He was marginally tighter into the hairpin in the stadium during the run, enough to make a difference when there had been almost nothing to choose between the two teammates.Ricciardo gave a guttural roar of celebration on taking the place. “I let a bit out once I heard I got pole,” he said. “It’s been a while since pole. It’s been a while since we had a pretty good weekend in general and we’ve been quick all weekend, from the start. And from the team’s point of view to get a one-two in qualifying is awesome.”It is a hugely positive result for the Australian, who is going to Renault next year, as he has been strongly out-qualified by Verstappen this season. For Red Bull it was a vindication of their optimism in Mexico. The thinner air at altitude here negates their power deficit and the high downforce setup plays to the strengths of their car. They were able to make the most of it when it mattered and are well set to take the win. Hamilton might have other ideas but with a championship on the line may well opt to let the two duel it out between themselves and secure greater glory.Valtteri Bottas was in fifth with Kimi Räikkönen in sixth. Nico Hülkenberg and Carlos Sainz were strong for Renault, finishing in seventh and eighth, with the Saubers of Charles Leclerc and Marcus Ericsson in ninth and tenth.Fernando Alonso in the McLaren was 12th and went out in Q2 behind the Force India of Esteban Ocon. The second Force India of Sergio Pérez was in 13th in front of the two Toro Rossos of Brendon Hartley and Pierre Gasly.Romain Grosjean in the Haas was eliminated in 16th in Q3 with his teammate Kevin Magnussen in 18th. McLaren’s Stoffel Vandoorne was in 17th with the two Williams of Lance Stroll and Sergey Sirotkin once again at the back of the field in 19th and 20th."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/245716f7e1924d61e7abfc674d2873c86c8352a8/477_105_2416_1450/master/2416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46b642a6024b5a01b85caa9164d3090e","title":"sri lanka england t20 match report","story":"• England 187-8 Sri Lanka 157 all out• Denly marks first international for eight years with star displayEight years in the international wilderness may have seen lesser cricketers give up on the dream of one day returning to the highest level. But not Joe Denly.And on a steamy night in Colombo the 32-year-old’s unwavering belief culminated in a fairytale comeback for his country, bowling England to a 30-run victory over Sri Lanka in their one-off Twenty20 with career-best figures of four for 19 off his leg-spin.There were other standout performances in a match that saw Eoin Morgan’s side end the rain-affected white-ball leg of their tour with the record: played six, won four, lost one.Adil Rashid claimed three for 11 from four overs, underlining his confidence and form at present, while Chris Jordan helped close the deal with for two for 29 after jetting in for this match alone. Jason Roy had earlier led the way with the bat too, crashing an eventful 69 from 36 balls that helped set the hosts 188 to win.But few could begrudge Denly being handed the over-sized cheque for man of the match, having chipped in a useful 20 from an unfamiliar position at No7 in England’s 187 for eight – he opens for Kent – before wiping out the stumps of both openers with the new ball.When he finished off with two wickets in the final over to see Sri Lanka bowled out for 157, it capped a remarkable evening for a player who was discarded on the eve of England’s World Twenty20 win in 2010 and has scarcely featured in selection debates since until his one-time county colleague Ed Smith took over this year.“It’s been a long time coming,” said Denly, whose absence has ned 384 England matches across all formats. “Never give up on that dream. I certainly feel a different player to where I was back then and I came in with the attitude of embracing it and enjoying every moment of it.”The total that resulted from England being asked to bat – one sliced in two by an hour of rain at 11.2 overs – was a pretty harum-scarum affair, not least for Roy who found incident at every turn.On 20 he survived a return catch to Isuru Udana. Two balls later Sri Lanka were appealing for obstruction after a shy at the stumps struck his backside. In the one over from Lakshan Sandakan he was dropped twice on 34 and 41 – two shoddy efforts in the deep – and there was another on 53 as Kamindu Mendis, the ambidextrous spinner, was denied a wicket on debut by a tumbling deep cover.Roy, who had earlier lost Jos Buttler and Alex Hales in the space of three balls – the latter wrongly adjudged lbw when sweeping Amila Aponso to end a miserable tour of 16 runs from three innings – was also one half of a slapstick run-out that saw Morgan depart for 11.But these madcap moments should not detract from some fearsome shots along the way, as Roy opened his account second ball by slotting Lasith Malinga over long-off for six before clearing the rope a further five times. Of his four fours, a slapped drive through cover off Mendis was anything but ambiguous.Roy’s departure, caught behind trying to cut Sandakan, came just moments before the rain delay and from 113 for four England’s innings fizzled out a touch. Moeen Ali blazed 27 from 11 balls but was bowled on the sweep, while Ben Stokes stuttered a touch with 26 from 27 as he and Denly were undone by Malinga’s low-slung wizardry.It may have been unfamiliar territory for Denly but, having developed his wrist-spin over the past few years, being asked to take the new ball in Twenty20 is certainly not. In his first two overs his slider crashed into the stumps of Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Mendis to derail the chase from the outset.Rashid was not to be upstaged on a heady night for English leg-spin, snuffing out a surge by Dinesh Chandimal and Mendis as Hales salvaged something from his trip with a pair of cool catches on the rope. When the Yorkshireman trapped Dhananjaya de Silva lbw for 17 on review in the 11th over, Sri Lanka sat 77 for five.From there it was a case of closing out the game. And though the hulking Thisara Perera struck six sixes amid a 31-ball 57, any meaningful support was vaporised by Liam Plunkett yorking the last recognized batsman in Dasun Shanaka.Jordan picked up the tail-end pairing of Udana and Amila Aponso – the former clothing a full toss to mid-off, the latter castled by another toe-crusher – before Denly returned for the final over to have Perera caught on the rope and bowl Malinga neck and crop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd1f72899c68003c7f5a138df846efd13aeb46b9/0_81_5184_3112/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4829ed0c9f98080aa5e7848c7f33cd60","title":"boston red sox los angeles dodgers world series game 4 latest score","story":"Email from Chris O’Brien:The pen isn’t really that depleted, thanks to Eovaldi.Most of them pitched an inning of less. They’re grandTrue, it could be a lot worse.The infamous Manny Machado is up now, hopefully this time he won’t be turning any doubles into singles like yesterday. Instead he just flies out to JD Martinez. And that does it for the first. just 17 more to go. (Joking. I hope.)And now it’s the Gritty-esque Justin Turner whose doing his job and making Rodriguez throw a whole bunch of pitches, eventually walking after working a full count.Max Muncy is up now for the Dodgers. As you may imagine he gets a tremendous ovation from the fans here. He works a full count and the crowd gets even louder. He grounds out the first. No magic this time around.Eduardo Rodriguez is up, in for Eovaldi, who pitched so memorably in “relief” last night (although it’s extremely likely that Rodriguez will threw far fewer pitches in his start than he did in his). Rodriguez strikes out Freese to start things off here in the bottom of the first.Good start for Rich Hill. It should be noted that the Dodgers aren’t a fan of having him face lineups more than twice, so the less hitters he has to face per inning, the better.Instead Rich Hill gets Martinez to swing and miss. That’s two strikeouts in the inning for Hill and we go to the bottom of the 1st.Steve Pearce takes a walk, giving J.D. Martinez a chance to extend the Red Sox’s success in two-out situations.Adam Benintendi flies out. That’s two down for Rich Hill, or Dick Mountain, as he likes to be known. No really that’s his nickname.And Mookie Betts strikes out. The probable AL MVP has been in a slump here in the World Series.Rich Hill enters the game and throws the first pitch to Mookie Betts and it’s high. 1-0. We have baseball!Email from Adam FletcherMy first world series - 1986, on the American Forces Network radio service that you could pick up on Medium Wave, just near BBC Radio Wales (god bless Greenham Common). I set the alarm for 12.30am and was woken by ‘take me out to the ballgame’. Particular memories - the ‘Go Mets parachuter in Game 6, and then Buckner, obviously. By the time of the Twins Cardinals match up the following year I’d moved away to University and could barely get a signal.If you’re gonna have a first World Series there’s worse ones to have than 1986 (unless you are a Boston fan).Email from Roger Kirby, a veteran of these liveblogs:Hi Hunter, so on 5hrs sleep here we go again. I wonder how many folks in L.A. used up their earthquake emergency rations during last nights game?Prediction? A slugfest by either one or both teams tonight. The bats have been cold for too long. Don’t count the Sox out of this, they have long ball guys too. The result? Anyone’s guess after last night.It’s hard to imagine that the Red Sox will ever go as cold at the plate as they did last night.And we’re getting close to game time. Los Angeles looks a lot nicer than Boston does right now.Meanwhile, Kirk Gibson was here not to throw out the Opening Pitch but reenact his legendary home run:I wouldn’t mind setting a new record for shortest. It’s not gonna happen with Rodriguez pitching though.It’s prediction time! I’m going with the Dodgers tonight for reasons that are mostly obvious. They’re the most depleted team and even in normal circumstances, Eduardo Rodriguez is an inefficient (although often effective) pitcher. He struggles to get through five innings, which means Cora could have to lean on his exhausted bullpen.Your thoughts? Send them to @HunterFelt or tweet them hunter.felt.freelance@the.Before I forget, I have to give a shout out to David Lengel for covering the entirety of the 7+ hour baseball epic without showing any signs of fatigue. Eovaldi-esque. I feel a tad bit guilty it was the only game I wasn’t scheduled to attend or blog. (Note: this may have just jinxed it. This one’s going ten hours, isn’t it?)David Freese batting leadoff. Let’s get weird.Holt is starting over Kinsler, which probably should make Sox fans happy.The Red Sox had a chance to win Game 3 in extra innings had Ian Kinsler hadn’t made this play. There can’t be anyone on the planet who hopes that Boston goes on to win the whole thing more than Kinsler. Nobody wants to the goat. I will note that this game would have been much different had the first four batters in the Boston lineup went 0-for-70 billion at the plane.If they had to do all over again, the Boston Red Sox probably wouldn’t have bothered to tie things up late in last night’sthis morning’s Game 3. They could have lost the game with the knowledge that Los Angeles Dodgers starter Walker Buehler had overpowered them his brilliant but now barely-remembered pitching performance. Instead, Jackie Bradley Jr tied the game up 1-1 in the eighth and the teams entered extra innings in what ended up being the longest game in World Series history.Long story short, Max Muncy’s walk-off home run sealed the 3-2 Dodgers win, preventing the team from falling into a a 0-3 hole. Boston’s lead in the series has been cut to 2-1 and this series has officially begun.While both team’s bullpens were depleted in Game 3, it feels that Boston has been hit harder. They couldn’t even find a starter who didn’t pitch last night. Today’s starter in Eduardo Rodriguez, who came into Game 3 to strike out Joc Pederson. The Dodgers, meanwhile, are going with former Sox hurler Rich Hill. All of this has been bad for the Red Sox, but good for baseball. If the Dodgers had lost, the World Series would have been effectively over. It’s impossible to imagine that they would be able to win four straight against this Red Sox team, especially with not two games at Fenway Park. Now, the Dodgers could tie with a win tonight and we’re guaranteed that this is going at least five games. So, tonight we’ll see if the Red Sox can shake off the heartbreaking loss or if the Dodgers can make this a six game series. If you want to contribute to this liveblog you can email hunter.felt.freelance@the or tweet @HunterFelt. Hopefully this time around we’ll have a final before the seven hour mark. It’s Game 4 of the World Series between the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodgers Stadium. The game starts a bit past 8pm EST, but we will return with lineups and things of that nature beforehand.Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s how an epic Game 3 unfolded:Max Muncy nearly ended this mind-bending game in the 15th inning, but a ball that looked destined to end up as a home run hooked just around the right foul pole, and a collective groan from the home fans in Dodger Stadium followed. When the Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman stepped up to the plate three innings later, he made sure it would be the final at bat of the game, if not the day.A game that began at 5.10pm on Friday ended at 12.30am on Saturday when Muncy launched a Nathan Eovaldi 90mph fastball into the left-field bleachers. Muncy rounded third, and the Dodgers dugout emptied in delirious euphoria to celebrate the 3-2 victory. Finally, at long last, they were headed to bed, and more importantly, won’t face elimination against the Boston Red Sox when the teams play again later in the day.Click here for the full report:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c95a0f0545e87b08760f315ceffa2f8ea5386c5a/298_310_3544_2126/master/3544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55950ad341f43c13a9ef17159389c51b","title":"50 best uk pubs sunday lunch craft beer history dog friendly","story":"The pub is a great British invention. Here, experts pick their favourites for Sunday lunch, picturesque settings, craft beer, history and more. All (but one) are child- and dog-friendlyFor those who prefer their views more landscaped than wild, this pub is next to Henley’s elegant Georgian bridge, at the point where Oxfordshire meets Berkshire. The river is placid, the ducks entertaining, the air clean, and sunsets and mist keep the view varied all year round. The Angel ought to be a snooty tourist trap but remains a proper pub, with proper ale – Brakspear is a true Oxfordshire classic. The pub even has its own moorings for people with boats – or you can just wear deck shoes and pretend.• theangelhenley, every day 11.30am -10pm (closes 7pm Sunday)Permanently moored at Hotwells, west of the city centre, this retired industrial vessel, built in 1936, is now one of Bristol’s brightest, airiest pubs, offering a view of the magnificent SS Great Britain across an expanse of water always teeming with activity. There’s a range of interesting local beers in cask and keg, with a particular emphasis on the reliably decent Bristol Beer Factory. Sit on a stool by the window and watch dinghies swoop and turn and water taxis glide by, while historic ships the Matthew and the Mayflower (not that one) make their rounds. And you may occasionally see a dog on a paddleboard.• grainbarge, noon-11pm (11.30pm Thu-Sat)Like many licensed premises in attractive settings, this old pub is now more hotel-restaurant, but at its heart remains a welcoming stone inn, decked out with nautical relics. It’s still fine to turn up in hiking boots and have a pint without eating, either on the terrace on a sunny day or at the bar next to the wood-burner (dining is more formal in the evening, with lighter fare at lunch). In the right weather, Babbacombe Bay does a passable impression of the Mediterranean, with the sea just the right shade of turquoise. Inland, the wooded slopes and red Devon sandstone are beautiful too. To stay the night is pricey, with rooms from £245.  • caryarms, noon-11pmPopular with hikers who huddle here to warm up and dry off (“Please Do Not Block the Fire As Others Around You Also Like to Feel the Heat”) the Crown is a no-nonsense pub with no-nonsense old-fashioned beer and warming, filling food. Looming over the plain stone building is Pen-y-Ghent, the smallest of the famous Three Peaks, but a wonder nonetheless, especially with the shadows of fast-moving clouds playing over its green-grey bulk, or snow on its sides.• crown-hotel, Mon-Fri noon-3pm, 6pm-11pm , Sat noon-11pm (10.30pm Sun)The view from this pub is dominated by the town’s castle, a relic of the Norman invasion. Beyond that is the steep wooded cut of the twisting Wye Valley: you can’t see it from the pub, but a short walk between pints will get you there. The Three Tuns is an old pub with a modern makeover that works rather well – it’s idiosyncratic and has friendly bar staff. There’s a line-up of solid ales from Wales and south-west England.• On Facebook, Mon-Fri noon-11pm, Sat-Sun 10.30am-11pmThe start of the Pennine Way, just outside the village of Edale, is only a short train journey from Manchester or Sheffield, but feels much further, offering a deep country atmosphere without too much effort. This pub makes a point of welcoming those with muddy feet and is surrounded by darkly looming but still manageable hills.

The beer garden is unusually lovely by English standards, too.• dorbiere, noon-11pm (Sun 10.30pm)Moors and oceans are great, but looking up the Tyne towards the city’s bowed bridges from this pub in Ouseburn is another kind of delight. It is especially exciting at sunset, as the Instagrammers and amateur photographers of north-east England have discovered – city lights gleaming against Miami Vice skies. The pub cleverly treads the fine line between craft beer hipness and down-to-earth backstreet local atmosphere (the ancient tables have Scottish \u0026amp Newcastle blue star logos). Imperial stouts and double IPAs sit alongside sessionable cask ales, aspirational street food alongside local meat pies.• On Facebook, 11am-11pm, Fri-Sat 10am-midnightThis old-fashioned harbourside pub sometimes feels ready to weigh anchor and set sail itself, thanks to nautical fixtures, maps and memorabilia. Views are of Porthgain’s picturesque working harbour, the Celtic sea, and hillsides dramatically strewn with the ruins of hoppers that once held crushed stone from nearby quarries, for road building. In summer, the green in front of the pub is packed with tourists and excited children, but out of season the pub is a warm, safe spot for watching waves break over the harbour wall.• sloop, 9.30am-10pm (midnight Fri-Sat)This part of Suffolk rolls away forever, with a sky that’s somehow bigger than anywhere else. The Harbour Inn, by the River Blyth among boat sheds and jetties, is a pub designed against flood: in the lower bar, power-points are on the ceiling, pints are passed down through a hatch, and the floors are tiled for the ease of sweeping away mud. In summer it’s the perfect spot for watching clean white clouds float over the marshes, while at night there’s the opposite of a view – blessed blackness, and muttering estuary winds that bring to mind the ghost stories of MR James.• harbourinnsouthwold, every day 11am-11pmThis is a rambling, cosy pub with two beer gardens, its own affiliated microbrewery, and a sigh-inducing view of Trevaunance Cove between cliffside stretches of the South West Coast Path.

There are always six hand-pumps in the compact bar, offering beers that change as regularly as the weather in this part of the world (breweries include Nomadic and Wild Child). The pub also hosts beer tastings, meet-the-brewer nights and an annual harvest festival. During the 2015 flooding, the pub, sitting on higher land, acted as hub and hearth for those affected by the deluge. This is a well-pubbed part of the world, but the atmopshere and beers mark it out as special.• foxandgoose.org, Mon 2pm-midnight, Sun-Thu noon-midnight, Fri-Sat noon-2am Time has a habit of leaving its trace on village pubs and the Duke is no different. Originally built as a medieval hall house, it became an inn during the 17th century. Old beams can be seen above the bar, and the ghost name of a former brewery owner is just visible on an outside wall. Reopened with the help of what is obviously a very active community (volunteers also run the village shop), this is a lively place attracting drinkers, foodies and families with events including pizza nights, beer and food evenings and a general sense of a good time. Help yourself to dog biscuits if you bring your best friend.• thedukeofmarlborough, Wed-Sat noon-11pm, Sun noon-6pmThe good people of Bamford thought big when saving their pub in 2013: they also took over an adjoining cafe and post office, so you can send a postcard, have a cup of tea and a scone and, when the sun is over the yardarm, into the pub you pop for a pint or two. Flagstones, bare stone walls, wooden beams and settles set the scene for the interior, and in the winter you can sip your beer by the log-burner. There is good robust, home-cooked food and a sense of belonging, and after a day walking in the Peak District, foamy Black Sheep bitter is an ideal contemplative pint. • anglers.rest, 11am-11pm (Sun 10.30pm)Opened as the Hope Beer House in the 1870s, this pub got its mock-Tudor panelling between the wars. In 2010, closure loomed, but locals clubbed together and bought the lease (adding the freehold in 2015). Now it’s an award-winning pub with two bars and a conservatory at the back. The mood is comfortable and cosy, with plenty of old photographs, thoughtful beers from the likes of Siren, Vibrant Forest and Magic Rock and a hum of conversation in the air – all of which demonstrates wherever there’s a lively community, hope is always present. • hopecarshalton, Mon-Sat noon-11pm, Sun 10.30pm. No childrenIn 2010, what was then the Bevendean pub was closed by the police due to a series of antisocial incidents, leaving this housing estate close to the South Downs and Brighton University without its hub. Four years later it reopened as the Bevy, after locals bought it and carried out essential works (the vicar spent a day sanding). The result is a bright, airy, chilled-out and chatty pub that is more than just a place for a pint and something to eat (breakfasts are very popular). There’s a cafe, meeting space for clubs and organisations, quizzes and music nights. The whole project is an example of how an urban pub in an unfashionable area can be saved. • thebevy, noon-11pmThis part of the world is made for thinking: the mountains of southern Snowdonia brood, while the slate mines of neighbouring Blaenau Ffestiniog are long silent. But at Y Pengwern (the Pengwern Arms) there is laughter, the clink of glasses full of copper-hued beer brewed in nearby Porthmadog, and the strum of guitars on music night. Seven years ago villagers bought the last pub in the village, which had been closed since 2009, and saved this former drovers’ inn, where Victorian writer George Borrow once had a few ales. The new kitchen uses as much local produce as possible. There are also rumours of a ghost, Martha, who once owned the pub. She can now rest easy. • ypengwern, Mon-Thu 6-11.30pm, Fri 5pm-midnight, Sat noon-midnight, Sun noon-11.30pmThe beer at this stone-built pub in a beautiful fellside village doesn’t have to travel far – it’s made next door. Community ownership of Hesket Newmarket Brewery came first, in 1999, and it was only several years later that the villagers (including long-time regular Chris Bonington) clubbed together to buy the pub. There’s a real fire, black-and-white prints on the wall and mugs and jugs hanging from wooden beams. This is ale territory, with not a creme brûlée porter in sight, though American hops make an appearance in the Brim Fell IPA.• theoldcrownpub, Mon-Thu noon-2.30pm, 5.30-11pm, Sat noon-11pm, Sun noon-10.30pmThe Rose \u0026amp Crown was taken under community ownership in 2013, the first of its kind in the north-east. Built in the 17th century, it’s a cosy little hideaway in a village close to Slaley Forest. The decor is traditional (settles, wooden beams and a solid bar), the beer from a variety of local breweries including Allendale and High House Farm (all cask beers come from within a 10-mile radius). The menu reflects the mixed tastes of a rural community, from black bean vegetable stir fry to a whale of a battered fish with chips. There’s a disused nuclear bunker close by, but the Rose \u0026amp Crown is a much more life-affirming attraction. • roseandcrownslaley, Mon-Thu and Sun noon-10.30pm, Fri and Sat noon-11pmIf there’s no one behind the bar when you arrive, chances are someone on your side will serve you, such is the fraternal nature of this compact village pub just outside Exeter. The community currently leases the pub and is raising funds to buy it outright as the building’s owner wants to sell. It would be a shame if it was lost, as it is a true community hub, hosting a book club, gin tastings, quizzes and bingo it’s also welcoming inside, with horse brasses, beams, a wood-burner and the kind of patterned carpet all village pubs aspire to. Three cask beers are available, as well as Sandford Cider, made in nearby Crediton. Here’s hoping the villagers meet their target.• stokecanoninn, Mon-Thu 11.30am-2.30pm, 5.30-11pm, Fri-Sun 11.30am-11pmRed brick, solid, implacable – the Red Lion has stood opposite the village green since the 18th century. In the early 1980s, then owner Whitbread decided to sell, and it was rumoured it would become a steakhouse – banishing any sense of localism. But the villagers rallied round and the UK’s first community-owned pub came into existence. Cricket is big in Preston, and the Red Lion is almost like a club house for the four teams that turn out in the summer. There are cosy log fires, darts, great food and, in early November, a fireworks display. No wonder it’s currently Camra North Hertfordshire’s Pub of the Year.• theredlionpreston, Mon-Fri noon-2.30pm, 5.30-11pm, Sat noon-3.30pm, 5.30-11pm Sun noon-3.30pm, 7-10.30pmBy Adrian Tierney-Jones, member of the British Guild of Beer WritersOn a limestone cliff overlooking the Jurassic coast, this was originally a pair of cottages and has only been a pub since 1793. It boasts a museum of stonemasonry and local fossils, and the big stone slabs used as beer garden tables make it feel like there’s been a pub here since the stone age. There’s no bar: you queue outside the scullery door. This is one of a handful of pubs to have made it into every single edition of Camra’s Good Beer Guide. • squareandcompasspub, summer noon-11pm, winter noon-3pm, 6-11pmWander into the small village of Warham and you could believe you’ve stepped back into the 1950s. The interior of the pub does its best to maintain this illusion. One room resembles a Victorian sitting room, with a portrait of her imperial majesty and another of local lad Lord Nelson flanking an old piano. Another room is a scullery full of old posters advertising Oxo, mustard powder and bile beans. This interior may not be strictly “authentic” – the landlord is a keen collector – but that really doesn’t matter. It’s still an absorbing escape from the 21st century. • warhamhorseshoes, Mon-Sat 11am-11pm, Sun noon-10pmLondon’s last galleried coaching inn is hidden inside a former railway goods yard: you could work on busy Borough High Street for years without spotting this National Trust-owned pub. Tourists from the US and Japan cross the river in search of its ancient wooden balconies that stand in defiance of the Shard, looming overhead. Dickens definitely drank here Chaucer began the Canterbury Tales in the Tabard, which stood next door until the 1880s and Shakespeare almost certainly saw plays performed in its courtyard – a predecessor of, and inspiration for, the first purpose-built theatres. • greeneking-pubs, Mon-Thu 11am-11pm, Fri-Sat 11am-midnight, Sun noon-10.30pmDuring the 1819 Peterloo Massacre, the 15th Hussars and the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry – consisting largely of local businessmen – rode past this pub on their way to slaughter unarmed civilians. The place had a different name then, but according to legend it acquired its new one when it sheltered people from the carnage. The story is told in murals on the pub’s walls, and along corridors which always seem to lead to snug corners you never noticed on previous visits. A lone survivor of long-demolished streets, this hulk of a building still seems to succour the exhausted office workers who slump through its doors. • On Facebook, Mon-Thu noon-midnight, Fri-Sat noon-1am, Sun noon-11pmAs places where communities gather, Belfast pubs were easy targets during the Troubles, and the Sunflower wasn’t the only one to be attacked. It is, however, the only one that retains a monument to those times in the shape of the iron cage outside the door, where people could be checked for weapons. Today, the cage remains unlocked. A slogan on the wall beside it, copied from long-gone graffiti just up the road, reads: “No topless bathing. Ulster has suffered enough,” reminding drinkers that humour was always a defence against adversity. • sunflowerbelfast, Mon–Thu noon -midnight, Fri-Sat noon-1am, Sun 5pm-midnightPurpose-built as an inn in the 14th or 15th century, the George has been endlessly remodelled since (recent work revealed 15 types of plaster on the top floor alone). Its visual attraction lies in additions that are clearly very old sitting atop stone so ancient it almost seems to be melting. Inside, the open fires, candlelit tables and leaded windows feel unchanged rather than artificially preserved or restored, evoking centuries of people sitting here eating, drinking and laughing. Upstairs, the creaking bedrooms will provide a challenge for even the most sceptical disbeliever in ghosts.• georgeinnnsp. Mon-Sat 10am-10pm, Sun noon-10pmThis red-brick Victorian pub is a classic example of designs that are much more beautiful than they strictly needed to be. Joyless reformers used to complain that features like tiles, stained glass and snob screens, all beautifully preserved here thanks to a Grade II listing, used to keep people in pubs spending money they didn’t have. There was also a view that the poor simply didn’t deserve surroundings like this: it would give them ideas. Laurel and Hardy drank here when performing in Birmingham, and even served behind the bar.• thebartonsarms, Mon-Sat noon-11pm, Sun noon-10.30pmMany pubs offer the promise of stepping back in time. The difference with the Canny Man’s is that you can’t be quite sure what time you’re stepping back into. At first glance it’s Victorian, but the 1940s crooning from the jukebox, the plush Venetian red stools, the collections of parasols, photographs, musical instruments and several lifetimes worth of random stuff, mean that if you were born any time between 1930 and 1980, this place will remind you of visiting an ancient aunt. She never had a drinks list this good though.• cannymans, Sun-Wed 11am-11pm, Thu 11am-midnight, Fri-Sat 11am-1amHidden down a back alley (like any self-respecting ancient tavern), Whitelocks is the oldest pub in Leeds. Built in 1715, it is long and narrow with low ceilings. You’re inevitably pressed up close to a bar that seems filled with more drinks than you could have thought possible. The eight-inch step up behind the bar means the staff gaze benignly down on you, making you feel like a grown child in a magical, alcohol-infused sweet shop. The beer selection is timeless rather than old-fashioned: the sister bar next door is full of craft beer, but in places like this, decent ale never went away.• whitelocksleeds, Mon-Thu 11am-midnight, Fri-Sat 11am-1am, Sun 11am-11pmThe very best pubs serve as extensions of the publican’s personality, and may even be manifestations of their passions and interests. High in the Preseli hills, and built of pinky-red corrugated iron, Tafarn Sinc was thrown up quickly as a train stop connecting the slate mines in the hills to the towns in the valleys below. There’s no reason why it should now be a pub with a garden featuring mannequins on an old station platform and steam train sound effects. But there’s no reason why it shouldn’t, either. • tafarnsinc.cymru, daily 11am-late (closed Mon in winter)By Pete Brown, author of Miracle Brew: Adventures in the Nature of Beer (Cornerstone, £9.99). Available at  Bookshop for £8.59Despite its location between Cowgate and the Royal Mile, this bar and 350-strong bottle shop remains cool, calm and civilised, even in Edinburgh’s busiest seasons. Twelve keg lines pour innovative beers from breweries as distant as Leith’s Pilot and London’s Partizan (in pints now too, not just schooners!), and you can drink anything from the shop in the bar (£2 corkage). Tap takeovers with the likes of Burning Sky or Malmö’s Rocket add further interest.In this plainly decorated former Georgian coaching inn, the cask ale selection starts out traditional (Stancill’s Barnsley Bitter, £2.60 a pint), but its keg lines are devoted to wild, modernist beers from global leaders such as Manchester’s Cloudwater, Copenhagen’s Warpigs and Barcelona’s Garage Beer. Its cask beer festivals (the next is 29 Nov-1 Dec) are a riot of one-off brews, as are the Shakespeare’s own out-there collaborations (horseradish and beetroot stout, anyone?). Similarly, its Stupidly Delicious Beer events showcase rare, aged imperial stouts alongside just-released, super-fresh double IPAs. • shakespeares-sheffield, Sun-Thu noon-midnight, Fri-Sat noon-1pmOpened in 1997 – when the very concept of a European-style cafe-bar was a novelty, “specialist beer” meant Belgian and the cool kids were still drinking Red Stripe – North has evolved into one of the UK’s foremost beer hangouts. It has also spawned six sister bars and North Brewing Co (which launches its own 24-tap bar in Leeds this November). North’s minimalist, wooden-slat interior – it’s like drinking in the belly of a whale – feels timelessly modern and its caskkeg lines showcase contemporary beers from the northern craft powerhouses alongside international trendsetters such as Brus or Basqueland. Decent, snacky scran and late-night DJs, too. • northbar, Mon-Tue 11am-1am, Wed-Sat 11am-2am, Sun noon-midnightIn a region dominated by St Austell brewery pubs, Falmouth is something of craft beer sanctuary (see also, pub-bookshop Beerwolf). A natty bar in the historic Old Brewery Yard, Hand is an 11-tap setup (two gravity-dispensed cask beers are kept in the cellar), which flies the flag for cutting-edge Cornish breweries Harbour, Verdant, and Black Flag, as well as sourcing from far and wide. It recently held a tap takeover with New York brewery Equilibrium. Note: £1.50 corkage to drink in from the bottle shop. • On Facebook, Mon-Thu 1pm-1am, Fri-Sun noon-1amHead out into Ouseburn and there are grittier (Free Trade Inn) and quirkier (Cumberland Arms) pubs that are equally essential, but this surprisingly swanky brewpub under the Tyne Bridge – part post-industrial craft bar, part gentleman’s club – is a cosy winter bolthole. It is closely associated with the excellent local Wylam brewery, whose beers feature prominently, as do experimental creations from the pub’s own microbrewery. The Bridge’s food is relatively affordable and reliably brilliant. • thebridgetavern, Sun-Thu noon-11pm, Fri-Sat noon-1amThe best beer bar in London? That is impossible to call. It is a huge city with numerous options which, either on choice (Craft Beer Co, Euston Tap) or novelty for a beer tourist (Crate, the Harp, the Rake), might easily fill this slot. A stylish railway arch bar in Bethnal Green, Mother Kelly’s gets the nod because across its six fridges and 19 keg beer taps, even the most well-travelled beer geek will find something new and arresting. From a Three Floyds and Burning Sky collaboration to Metal Face, an aged mixed-fermentation saison from Oxbow Brewing (no, me neither), Mother Kelly’s is a feast of one-offs, experimental ales and rare collaborations from around the world – some eye-wateringly expensive. • motherkellys, Mon 4pm-11pm Tue-Thu noon-11pm Fri-Sat noon-midnight, Sun noon-11pmDown by the Mersey, hot new craft outlets come (Dead Crafty, Black Lodge brewtap) and go (RIP the 23 Club) but, fittingly, given that its ground floor is decked out to resemble the prow of a boat, the Ship ploughs steadily on through every new wave in beer. Originally, a real ale pub, the Ship now has 10 cask pumps augmented by 14 craft-keg lines of constantly rotating joy. The Ship also runs a city-centre bottle shop (Ship In A Bottle), the Flagship brewery and the Wirral Beer Festival (Easter 2019). • theshipandmitre Sun-Wed 10am-11pm, Thu 10am-midnight, Fri-Sat 9am-midnightBy Tony Naylor,  food and drink writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e962aae55b614264cf44f2a5f0b4c31c0cdec8ae/0_54_4270_2564/master/4270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0f24adae1c6eef9d8acc4d45f88f205","title":"strictly come dancing week six halloween special as it happens","story":"The 11 remaining couples took part in Strictly’s annual fright-night spectacular. But who will go bump in the night?I’ll be back tomorrow at 7.45pm for the results, so join me then for the dreaded dance-off. Thanks for joining in, and enjoy the rest of your Saturday! HxSo that’s it for the Halloween Spooktacular (DRINK)! That was quite fun, albeit a mixed bag on the dance front. Huge round of applause to the costume and makeup department as usual. Ashley and Pasha and Faye and Giovanni are joint top of the leader board, and Seann and Katya are at the bottom - wouldn’t be surprised to find them in the bottom two tomorrow, maybe alongside Dr. Ranj and Janette or Graeme and Oti? My faves tonight were definitely Stacey and Kevin, Joe and Dianne and Ashley and Pasha, although I’d probably slip Kate and Aljaz a vote for some mean marking. Scores: 6,7,8,8 - a total of 29 for Lauren and AJ.Craig thought Lauren’s shaping could do with some work, but he loved her focus and energy. Darcey loved Lauren’s attitude, but she needs more shaping. Shirley thought it was Lauren’s best dance, and Bruno thought it was a strong, proud and powerful performance.  So Lauren is supposed to be the Evil Queen from Snow White, whilst AJ looks like Westley from The Princess Bride. Nice log-splitting chopper action there. Lauren is doing a decent job of evil queen fierceness and focus, but her Paso lacks precision and her footwork is a bit stompy. Not nearly scary enough, sadly - a great effort but not enough attack. And FINALLY, it’s LAUREN AND AJ! Tonight they’re dancing the Paso Doble to ‘Poison’ by Nicole Scherzinger. I’m not familiar with this song from the Scherzinger back catalogue, but she’s the wicked queen of the pop banger. God, imagine being the Dave Arch singer who has to belt this out with Scherz IN THE AUDIENCE.Scores: 8,9,9,9 - a total of 35 for Joe and Dianne.Bruno though it was a Foxtrot with a bite, and Joe’s improvement has exceeded his expectations – Joe is leading the dance and he’s a good actor too. Craig loved the breakouts, and might even start following Joe on social media. Darcey loved the footwork, and we might well see Joe in the final. Shirley gives Joe a hug and talks about his nan – has anyone told her he’s 27 and not 15? It’s embarrassing, stop it.This has a Twilight fairground theme, with Joe spinning Dianne’s Waltzer. Scream if you want to go faster. Joe has addressed all manner of issues with his frame and is actually starting to look like a proper dancer. Very much enjoying the literal pushing and pulling – not sure the music quite works but it was a pretty good effort from Joe. Enjoyed that. Only two left! Next up it’s JOE AND DIANNE! This week they’re dancing the Foxtrot to ‘Youngblood’ by 5 Seconds of Summer. This is quite a stompy tune, more suited to something like a Tango (in my humble opinion). But the kids love a bit of 5SOS and it’s got ‘blood’ in the title, so l’m on board. Scores: 9,10,10,10 - a total of 39 for Faye and Giovanni. She isn’t going to win either, the nation demands a journey. Shirley thought it was first class, and an outstanding routine. Bruno thought it had all that jazz, and Craig agrees that it was A-MAY-ZING. Darcey loved it too – a stunning performance. Fog! DRINK! Well this is...theatrical, although there’s a bit too much floor humping for my liking and Faye actually does Jazz Hands. I’m sure that from a dance perspective that was incredibly good, but absolutely not my cup of tea I’m afraid. Who’s next? It’s FAYE AND GIOVANNI! This week they’re going for Couple’s Choice – a TheatreJazz routine to ‘Fever’ by Peggy Lee. Very disappointed that Faye hasn’t gone down the commercial route for her Couple’s Choice – I was hoping for a dance medley of Steps’ best moves at the very least. Still, TheatreJazz is absolutely my favourite thing*. I’m not accepting ‘Fever’ as a Halloween song, nothing spooky about running a temperature. BINGO FULL HOUSE! Down the rest of the bottle.Scores: 6,6,6,7 - a total of 25 for Charles and Karen.Darcey thought it started with loads of attack and intent, but there were moments with timing issues and Charles feet were a bit flappy. Shirley loved the routine and concept, but there were quite a few mistakes. Bruno loved the wacky energy and it had an infectious appeal. Craig loved it too, it just needed a bit of tidying up.Shirley in those evil contacts AND the schoolmistress glasses is entirely terrifying. Can I just express my disappointment that Charles opted to play it safe as Riff Raff, rather than strapping himself into a basque, stockings and suspenders as Frank N. Furter? If you’re going to do Rocky Horror, you might as well do it properly. I’m aggrieved.I am however very happy about the amount of actual Jive in this - Charles has got great timing and is giving his kicks and flicks both barrels. Bags of energy, great routine, and brilliant characterisation - I’m glossing over a few timing issues. LOVED that. Next up it’s CHARLES AND KAREN! This week they’re dancing the Jive to ‘Time Warp’ from the Rocky Horror Picture Show, following in the hallowed (halloweened?) footsteps of Jamelia and Tristan. If you have a 3D TV, you might want to move your chair back a bit before Charles does the pelvic thrusts.I’ll accept Time Warp as a Halloween song due to the film having the word ‘horror’. Also it’s a horrible song.Scores: 3, 5,6,6 - a total of 20 for Seann and Katya.

A 14th device was reported by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who has called for Trump’s impeachment.Cesar Sayoc was arrested at an auto parts shop in the city of Plantation on Friday morning. His white van, which was covered in stickers celebrating Republicans and denouncing the president’s opponents, was parked outside.Sayoc, 56, has an address in the Miami suburb of Aventura and an extensive arrest record. According to his social media accounts, he works as a booking agent for a live events company and is a former wrestler and cage fighter.Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, said at a press conference in Washington Sayoc had been charged with five offences including threats against former presidents, assaulting current and former federal officers and mailing explosives. The charges were filed to federal court in Manhattan.“Let this be a lesson to anyone, regardless of their political beliefs, that we will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats, intimidation and outright violence to further an agenda,” Sessions said.Asked why most of Sayoc’s alleged targets were Democrats, Sessions said: “He appears to be a partisan.” A court filing said the stickers covering Sayoc’s van included “images critical of CNN”, the TV station frequently derided by Trump, whose New York studios were the target of two bombs.Speaking at the White House, Trump praised the “incredible job” done by investigators and promised to punish the person responsible. Speaking later at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump won applause from his loyalist supporters for calling for national unity and an end to political violence. But he soon attacked the media, encouraged chants of “CNN sucks” and set the audience up to boo the Democratic House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and reprise “lock her up” chants aimed at Hillary Clinton.FBI director Christopher Wray said Sayoc had been linked by a fingerprint to a package sent to the California congresswoman Maxine Waters. DNA possibly from Sayoc was also found in one of the packages, Wray said, stressing that they contained authentic explosives.“These are not hoax devices,” Wray said, adding that more could yet be in the mail.Three bombs were confirmed by authorities when charges were brought, bringing to 13 the number known to have been sent. None exploded before being found and no injuries were reported.The packages found on Friday were sent to two senators, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California to James Clapper, a former director of national intelligence. Steyer, a donor to Democratic groups, said an additional suspect package addressed to him was intercepted in Burlingame, California.Sayoc was born in Brooklyn, New York, and registered as a Republican in 2016, according to public records. His social media accounts contain photographs and video clips in which he is wearing Trump’s signature red baseball cap with the slogan “Make America Great Again”.The 56-year-old has also posted material online denigrating Muslims and raising popular rightwing conspiracy theories including the false claim that Clinton killed a former deputy White House counsel, Vince Foster.He threatened CNN in a tweet in August. Rochelle Ritchie, a former aide to Democratic politicians, said on Friday she reported Sayoc to Twitter earlier this year after he warned her: “Hug your loved ones real close every time you leave you home.” Twitter told her Sayoc had not violated its rules. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.Sayoc’s arrest record stretches back more than 25 years and includes charges for theft, battery, domestic violence and other offences. In August 2002, he was found guilty of making a bomb threat to a utilities worker.Daniel Lurvey, an attorney who represented Sayoc in some of his criminal cases, said Sayoc had been “normal and courteous” and did not seem politically angry. “I think it’s a recent phenomenon that’s happening to a lot of people who have feelings under the surface that are brought out by this isive political climate,” said Lurvey.On Friday afternoon, police and security guards were blocking off an upmarket 27-story condominium block in Aventura, where Sayoc has been listed as a resident.Neighbours said they were surprised. But one, Dan Ochsenschlagen, said there had been friction on the condominium board between Sayoc’s mother, the registered owner of the apartment, and other board members. Ochsenschlagen said Sayoc’s mother, who often made political statements, was president of the board for 17 years until she was voted out last December.“Some of the things that were going on were very questionable,” Ochsenschlagen said. He said he had reported what he called “financial irregularities” to police in Miami.  was not immediately able to verify the claims.Authorities hoped Sayoc’s arrest would end the steady discovery of more matching envelopes, containing what appeared to be pipes packed with explosives and connected to wires, across the US. The criminal complaint against Sayoc said the packages included photographs of the targets’ faces that had been crossed out with a red “X”.The first package was discovered on Monday in a mailbox at the New York home of George Soros, a wealthy liberal donor. It was followed by similar packages intercepted by the secret service that were addressed to the homes of Obama and Clinton.Over the following days packages were found addressed to former vice-president Joe Biden, former attorney general Eric Holder, former CIA director John Brennan, Waters and the actor Robert De Niro. All are high-profile opponents of Trump.The package addressed to Booker was intercepted in Florida while the one for Clapper was discovered at a post office in Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan. It was addressed to Clapper at the offices of CNN, a few blocks away, where he is employed as an analyst.CNN’s Manhattan offices were evacuated on Wednesday when another suspected pipe bomb was sent there, meant for Brennan. Both former intelligence officials have been outspoken critics of Trump’s actions in office. Clapper on Friday said the packages were part of campaign of “domestic terrorism” intended to sow fear.“This is not going to silence the administration’s critics,” Clapper told CNN. “But anyone who has in any way been a public critic of President Trump needs to be on extra alert and take some precautions particularly with respect to mail.”Clapper praised the FBI for its work and for persevering in the face of abuse from the president. Trump has accused the FBI of being involved in a “deep state” conspiracy to undermine him and of botching an inquiry into a private email server used by Clinton. “Will the FBI ever recover its once stellar reputation?” he asked in a tweet in August.Shortly before the arrest, Trump complained that the attempted bombings were damaging his party’s prospects for next month’s midterm elections. He also appeared to stoke conspiracy theories.“Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this ‘Bomb’ stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows – news not talking politics. Very unfortunate, what is going on. Republicans, go out and vote!”, Trump said. The president had also complained in a 3am tweet he was being unfairly blamed for the attempted bombings.The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said Trump’s reaction was “wholly inappropriate” and showed he had “never fully made the transition” to being presidential. “Am I hopeful that the zebra changes his or her stripes today? No,” Cuomo said on CNN.Supporters of Trump speculated without evidence that the devices were not viable and could not have harmed people. Cuomo said: “No one can say that they were fake bombs. These were dangerous devices that could explode.”De Niro made his first remarks on the pipe bomb discovered at his offices in lower Manhattan. “I thank God no one’s been hurt, and I thank the brave and resourceful security and law enforcement people for protecting us,” he said. “There’s something more powerful than bombs, and that’s your vote.

Thirty nations had declared war between 1914 and 1918. Many countries along with Great Britain sided with the allies, including France, Italy, Russia, and the United States. The Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria supported Germany.Do you have letters, diaries, photographs or even memorabilia from any relatives or friends who remember Armistice Day?

Joyous, of course, unless you are a parent of small children, own pets, are working a night-shift over the weekend, or don’t like the trade off of earlier sunsets for a bit more morning light.2018 may mark one of the final times that the continent of Europe changes the clocks back in unison with the UK – or indeed at all, as moves are afoot to abolish daylight saving time in the EU.Since 2002, EU Directive 200084EC has regulated the time change between winter and summer time in the EU, stating that the last weekend in March and the last weekend in October should be the switchover dates. But a 2017 report by the European parliament into the practice has led to the European parliament voting that daylight savings time arrangement be reconsidered, allowing member states to opt out of changing their clocks. Some non-EU European countries, like Russia, Turkey, Belarus and Iceland, have already abandoned the practice.The argument in favour of the harmonising the clock change across the EU is that it helps the single market to function, and is beneficial to the transport sector, especially cross-border, while also making some energy savings.But scientists and politicians have become increasingly worried on the impact it has on the human sleep cycle. In 2016 an investigation by the German Bundestag concluded that “the process of adaptation to the time change might be more difficult for some people than has been assumed in earlier years”.Researchers had previously thought that the clock change, particularly in spring, caused people to suffer minor jet-lag style symptoms for a couple of days after the change. They now think, according to the Bundestag report, that the effects can last up to four weeks, and that “for some people the process of adaptation itself takes place only insufficiently or not at all”.While not the highest consideration in Brexit talks over the Irish border, it raises the possibility that in the future Dublin could have to choose between abolishing daylight savings time and creating a time-zone border with Northern Ireland, or retaining it and being out of step with the time zones of some fellow EU states.Changing the clocks seems set to stay in the UK. It is just over 100 years since the concept of changing the clocks was introduced by the 1916 Summer Time Act, and there doesn’t appear to be any great groundswell of opinion among British politicians about changing domestic arrangements for British summer time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59160972cb691bef69210aaddf0a0b5a15f396c/0_73_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4f8d298c39c1871f3ea4f0ab2b27aad","title":"exclamation marks week in patriarchy","story":"Much has been written on whether women should cut down on exclamation marks in the office. Sorry, but the answer is no!Nikki Waller, a Wall Street Journal editor recently did something extremely brave and incredibly difficult. She went a month – an entire month! – without using exclamation marks in email. The point of this sadomasochistic experiment was to investigate why the perky punctuation mark has become such a ubiquitous part of office communication and why so many people, particularly women, are self-conscious about their exclamation mark habit.Female bosses, Waller notes, “tread a thin line”. To be taken seriously in the workplace, women have to project gravitas and authority but also not come across as too tough and unfeeling.“Routine emails can become complex calculations about warmth, likability and authority,” she writes, with exclamation marks offered like olive branches. Like me! But respect me. But like me! While freeing herself from her exclamation addiction, Waller says, was tricky, it “felt great”. No longer weighing the emotional impact of every sentence, she felt like “just another manager, making sure work gets done”.There has been much written, in recent years, about whether women should cut down on exclamation marks in the office. Just as there has been much written about how women should stop saying sorry so much. And how they should be more assertive. And how they should speak up more. The upshot of all this advice is that if you want to get ahead in the corporate world, you should act a lot more like a “man”.Sorry, but I find that infuriating! Women are socialized to be people-pleasers, sure, but there’s nothing wrong with that. Trying to make other people feel comfortable is a good thing. It should be encouraged! Rather than telling women to lean in to obnoxious behavior, we should be encouraging a corporate world that isn’t governed by stereotypically male values. We should be teaching men to act more like women.We should also stop complaining about the proliferation of exclamation marks. Grammar snobs may love to hate them, but the reason we are so fond of them is that they’re an incredibly efficient way of conveying tone in electronic communication. It’s time we just got over exclamation inflation and embraced the much-maligned form of punctuation once and for all!Sahle-Work Zewde, a seasoned UN diplomat, has become the only female head of state in Africa. Her unanimous appointment comes a week after Ethiopia reorganized the government so women had half of all cabinet posts. While the role of president is largely ceremonial in Ethiopia, Sahle-Work’s ascension is still hugely significant. “In a patriarchal society such as ours, the appointment of a female head of state not only sets the standard for the future,” Fitsum Arega, the chief of staff for the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, said on Twitter. “But also normalizes women as decision-makers in public life.”On Thursday the New York Times published a report alleging Google protected a former employee, Andy Rubin, from sexual misconduct charges. After Rubin, who created Android, was accused of coercing a female colleague into a sex act, Google allegedly investigated and found the claim credible. The New York Times say that he was asked to resign but given “a hero’s farewell” and a $90mn exit passage to soften the blow. After the story was published Google’s CEO sent an email to all employees saying it had been “difficult to read” and the company was “dead serious about making sure we provide a safe and inclusive workplace”.Randa Siniora, general director of the Women’s Centre for Legal Aid and Counselling in Palestine, recently became the first female Palestinian campaigner to address the UN security council. “The Israeli occupation and the resulting humanitarian crisis are deeply gendered and exacerbate existing gender inequalities,” she said. “Women disproportionately endure the violence of occupation borne by all Palestinians, and often with gender-specific consequences.”But women are overlooked in the political debate. The plight of Palestinian women is also frequently overlooked by western feminists, I would add. Then again, there are so many more important things to write about. Such as: are exclamation points sexist?Yeah, I know penguins have nothing to do with the patriarchy, but it’s been a tough week.

She was here on a bright September day five years ago, when thousands thronged the nearby university square hoping to glimpse the then wildly popular Angela Merkel. And she was here last week, when the chancellor appeared in Fulda again, this time speaking behind closed doors to a few hundred diehard supporters.“Merkel will helicopter in, talk to the big businessmen for an hour, and then leave,” said Müller, 50. “All the while I’ll be standing here, trying to sell my sausages. Merkel should come to the market. I’m looking for someone that’s nearer to the people. But what do I know? I’m just a sausage seller.”Müller might swear she’s not important, but on Sunday, she and fellow voters in the central state of Hesse have the power to deliver a second electoral upset within a fortnight to Germany’s embattled ruling parties, potentially plunging both into fresh crises. The regional election is seen as decisive for the future of Merkel’s rickety coalition government.Last-minute polling showed support plummeting for both her Christian Democrat Union (CDU) and coalition partner the Social Democrats (SPD) in a swing state traditionally seen as a bellwether for national politics.Both parties were predicted to drop 10 points each since the state’s last regional election in 2013. Such a trouncing would come on the heels of a disastrous result in Bavaria that was widely seen as a protest against the failings of the Berlin government.“None of the parties are there for us,” said Müller, who has voted for both CDU and SPD in the past, but was still undecided. “What should I do? I have to vote, it’s my duty to stop the far right getting into power. But I also know I won’t be heard. I can vote for whoever I like the politicians will still do whatever they want.”With tensions running high in the CDU, mutinous members have implied that if Bouffier falls, it may cost the chancellor vital votes when she stands for re-election as party leader at its conference in early December. But Merkel, who joined Bouffier on the campaign trail last week, was at pains to play down the significance of the regional vote for her party, government and chancellorship.“Hesse, and what happens here, is being watched and considered from far beyond Germany’s borders,” Merkel told supporters on Thursday in Fulda. “I want to point out once again that on Sunday the vote is about Hesse. Afterwards we’ll talk again about Berlin.”“For me this will be a protest vote against all this nonsense in Berlin,” said Heiko Becker, 48, a lifelong swing voter now leaning towards the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). “Things are good for us in Hesse, but no one cares about that. It’s all about going against Merkel nowadays. Lots of people are switching their votes.”“We’re definitely profiting from the weakness of the grand coalition,” said Marion Neumeister, head of Fulda’s Green party office, adding she had noticed a marked increase in voters actively approaching her asking to be persuaded to vote Green. “We hardly have to say anything. Look at what they’re doing in Berlin, they’re driving people towards us.”The Greens are now polling at their highest nationwide since Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011. In the past, said Neumeister, local party members joked darkly that they’d only see such highs again if another nuclear reactor melted down. “Now we have our meltdown,” said Neumeister, eyeing the latest polls. “The CDU meltdown.”But disillusion with stagnant Berlin politics isn’t only a problem for the CDU. For Hesse’s SPD, the coalition’s record is proving just as awkward.“It seems a large part of the population doesn’t want this grand coalition any more,” said Sebastian Busch, who is standing for the SPD in Hesse’s western district of Rheingau. “In the long term, we have to bring people a vision of a future in which one can trust politicians to do what they say they will.”The reckoning could come sooner rather than later. If the SPD is overtaken by the Greens in Hesse, party leader Andrea Nahles could be forced to step down. In the most extreme case, such a result could shock the SPD into leaving Merkel’s coalition, which would almost certainly trigger new elections.But however miserable it is in the current government, the SPD’s dismal nationwide polling figures means the party has little to gain from voluntarily forcing an election.“That would be the worst outcome for the SPD,” said Andrea Römmele, a communications professor at Berlin’s Hertie School of Governance. Merkel, she added, was likely to remain safe if the CDU could keep power in Hesse under a three-way coalition with the liberal Free Democratic Party and the Greens.“The only way Angela Merkel won’t come out OK is if Bouffier doesn’t remain state premier in Hesse,” said Römmele. “The way the polls are now, that’s not likely. We’ll have a government soon in Bavaria and a government in Hesse, and that will be the end of the conversation for now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc8c81cc5ed3264f5937d8914481c68a4a99f588/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e381dc185cda51c6f9d4ee264a206f6a","title":"ireland votes to oust blasphemy ban from constitution","story":"Decision is latest in ‘quiet revolution’ of seismic social and political changes in the countryCampaigners in Ireland celebrated the end of a “medieval” ban on blasphemy on Saturday, after voters overwhelmingly supported a referendum to remove the offence from the constitution.The decision was the latest reflection of seismic social and political changes in Ireland, which the taoiseach Leo Varadkar has described as a “quiet revolution”.“It means that we’ve got rid of a medieval crime from our constitution that should never have been there,” said Michael Nugent, chairperson of Atheist Ireland, which had campaigned for years to have blasphemy taken out of the constitution.Voters also returned president Michael Higgins to office, giving the 77-year-old poet and human rights campaigner another seven-year term by a comfortable margin.Until recently, Ireland was deeply conservative, dominated by the Catholic church, but the country has legalised gay marriage and abortion in popular votes, and is now led by an openly gay taoiseach.The government had already laid out legislation to remove the offence of blasphemy from the constitution and all relevant laws, should the referendum be passed.It has been more than 150 years since anyone was prosecuted for blasphemy in Ireland, but the country had passed a blasphemy law in 2009, making it the only western democracy to bring in new legislation in the 21st century.Three years ago, Irish police investigated comments made by comedian Stephen Fry on TV, when he described God as “capricious”, “mean-minded”, and an “utter maniac”.

Istanbul police say that Khashoggi was tortured and then murdered, and his body dismembered with a bone saw. Woods and farmland outside the city have been searched, but his remains have not been found.Erdoğan reiterated during an address to parliament on Friday that Riyadh must disclose the location of Khashoggi’s body and identify who ordered his killing – a sign that Ankara is willing to keep up the pressure on the beleaguered kingdom and its de facto ruler, the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.Khashoggi’s killing has severely damaged the heir to the throne, who many believe must at a minimum have been aware of the Saudi operation, which involved several members of his personal guard and other senior officials. It has also proved a major test for the Trump administration. The White House has put the young prince at the heart of its Middle East policy, key for both combating Iranian influence across the region and brokering an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.President Donald Trump has hardened his stance on the matter in the past week, calling it the “worst cover-up in history”, while at the same time emphasising Saudi Arabia’s role as America’s most important Arab ally and the value of US arms sales to the country.Jim Mattis, the US defence secretary, who also spoke at the summit in Manama, said that Khashoggi’s killing had “undermined regional stability”. Washington was considering additional punitive measures against those responsible after issuing visa bans for the suspects in the case, Mattis added."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Casey polls strongly to finish second while voters back removal of blasphemy offenceAnd the winning numbers are 14, 24, 30, 38, 40, 45, with bonus number 36President stresses potential impact of people\u0026rsquos words after securing second termUp to 20,000 athletes preparing to participate in 39th capital city endurance eventTaoiseach: \u0026lsquoI endorsed President Higgins, my party campaigned for him, he has won\u0026rsquoTaoiseach\u0026rsquos comments come as Fine Gael begin confidence-and-supply talks with Fianna F\u0026aacuteil\u0026lsquoAll useless\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquono to everybody\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquono to abortion\u0026rsquo among comments on ballot papers in presidential election\u0026lsquoThis kind of resentment has been smouldering and building for a period of time\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoI think . . . we need to tap into why people voted for him.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe President Michael D Higgins has said that in re-electing him for a second term voters have chosen hope over “any exploitation of ision or fear” and promised to be a president for “all the people”.Speaking in Dublin Castle after his re-election on the first count was confirmed, Mr Higgins said the Republic was in “a time of transformation” and he pointed to a “momentum for empathy, compassion, inclusion and solidarity which must be recognised and celebrated”.He acknowledged “the offer of public service that my fellow candidates have made in standing for this important role as president of Ireland” and said had been “deeply moved” by all the support he has got across party lines.“Over the next seven years, I will represent your voice, Ireland’s voice, as we face challenges that are not local,” he said.Mr Higgins received 822,566 votes, 56 per cent of the total poll to secure another seven years in Áras an Uachtaráin. It is the highest vote ever in any of the eight presidential elections in the history of the State.Independent candidate Peter Casey polled surprisingly well, taking 23 per cent of votes.Businessman Seán Gallagher, who 29 per cent of voters backed in 2011, performed poorly, receiving 6.5 per cent of votes.Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada was fourth on 6.4 per cent, with Senator Joan Freeman on 6 per cent.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has ruled out apologising to defeated presidential candidate Peter Casey. Mr Casey had called on Mr Varadkar to apologise over comments the Taoiseach made urging the public “to send a clear message” at the ballot box.Arriving at Dublin Castle for the declaration of the results in the Presidential election On Saturday night Mr Varadkar said: “Well I won’t be doing that.” “Yes a lot of people voted for Mr Casey,” said the Taoiseach, before adding that “we shouldn’t lose sight of the result here. I endorsed President Higgins, my party campaigned for him, he has won by a massive majority on the first count.” Referring to Mr Higgins’s success as a “ resounding result” and “historic victory”, he said the President had topped the poll “in every single constituency” among “all sections of the community, rural and urban”.To the echo of laughter Mr Varadkar said it was “highly unlikely” that Mr Casey would now be joining the Fine Gael party. Mr Varadkar also referred to recent polls which have shown Fine Gael to be 13 points more popular than Fianna Fáil, but said the popularity would not make him call a November election. He said he had refused to call an election in May after the last referendum and “people didn’t believe me. I hope you believe me now.” While he said “it is of course very encouraging that my party is on 35 per cent and we are ahead in every region, I think every age group and I think in both rural and urban Ireland. But no, I am not planning an election my focus is on getting people’s work done.” Mr Varadkar said the nature of the Presidency had been evolving since the election of Mary Robinson. “It has become an office that is not in the ownership of political parties. President McAleese, for example, when she sought re-election she sought re-election as an Independent. President Higgins sought it as an Independent today. I think people see the presidency differently to how they saw it in the past. What Fine Gael will do when they consider the presidency is to consider our options. On this occasion we considered our options and we saw we had an incumbent who did an excellent job, he would be overwhelmingly endorsed by the Irish people – and he was.” Asked if he believed the presidency should be brought into the scope of the Freedom of Information Act, Mr Varadkar replied it was something that the Government would consider. He said the presidency was constitutionally not answerable to Government, but “that is not to say it is not answerable to the people”. He said the Government would also “put proposals to the Irish public” in May that would open the presidential election to Irish citizens no matter where they live. In relation to the length of a presidency he said “a five-year term . . . would be more in line with modern norms than seven-year terms. But again that would require a referendum.”Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3678406.1540672706!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"higgins calls for republic of equality in acceptance speech","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Michael D Higgins gives a speech following the announcement of his re-election as President at Dublin Castle. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsPresident Michael D Higgins has said “words matter” and can hurt but also heal, as he made his acceptance speech for a second term in Áras an Uachtaráin.Mr Higgins also said Irish people wanted to see “security in shelter, housing that can be a home” as he sought to outline the themes for his next seven years in office.The President elaborated on his idea of a “real republic” that was at the centre of his re-election campaign but also made comments that could be seen as criticism of Peter Casey, who came second to Mr Higgins.Mr Casey’s campaign was boosted by controversial comments he made about the travelling community.In his speech in Dublin Castle after being declared the winner, Mr Higgins said: “Words matter. Words can hurt. Words can heal. Words can empower. Words can ide. The words and ideas I have used in this campaign, reflect a vision for Ireland based on four strands.”These strands are: “equal and together” “strong sustainable communities” “sharing history, shaping the future” and “Ireland’s voice matters”.“The next seven years will offer opportunities to do things in new ways including everybody,” Mr Higgins said.“That requires identifying and facing exclusions, and more than just eliminating barriers, it means the exercising of new invitations. A real republic is a republic of equality, of share vulnerabilities and of collective capacities.”He also touched on the current housing crisis and said “our people want to see security in shelter, housing that can be a home, as part of a healthy community”.“We are in a time of transformation and the Presidency, through its direct representation of, and direct conversation with, the people of Ireland, is an independent space where new ideas and possibilities can emerge.”He said Ireland must also “face the future with inclusion and creativity”, as he said he would like to see the next period of commemoration of the State’s foundation “spark a debate about the values , na fiúntaisí, the principles required in today’s Ireland”.“We will in 2019 celebrate the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil. We should use it to return to looking at our institutions and consider how they serve our values. How all people will participate in decision making in Ireland.”The next period of commemoration will mark “challenging, often difficult, periods of our history”. “This task will require sensitive thought, reflection and understanding – an ethics of memory and a narrative of hospitality, enabling different versions of shared events to be placed side by side, uncomfortable truths acknowledged.”In other comments that may be seen as a criticism of Mr Casey, Mr Higgins said: “The people have made a choice as to which version of Irishness they want reflected at home and abroad. It is the making of hope they wish to share rather than the experience of any exploitation of ision or fear.”Of his “real republic”, Mr Higgins said it is “a life lived together and ‘together’ has been one of those words that has resonated throughout this campaign, as has another word-authenticity. Both are so important. People are interested in conversations and ideas that are sincere and constructive.”He also said it is a “republic of equality, of shared vulnerabilities and of collective capacities”. “People at home and abroad speak to me about the need to rebalance environment, economy and society – and the need to ensure that the new technologically-driven changes are harnessed in a way that has universal benefit rather than creating new forms of inequality that our shared future will be one of sustainability and decent work a future that acknowledges a duty of care.”The President said he would be a president “for all the people, for those who voted for me and those who did not”. Now is the time, he said to be “active rather than passive”.“Clear choices are opening up as to what will be the character of our Irishness. Will it be a commitment to inclusion and a shared world or a retreat to the misery of an extreme inidualism?“Over the next seven years, I will also represent your voice, Ireland’s voice, as we face challenges that are global – responding to climate change and sustainability, the challenge of global hunger in a way that is sustainable, Brexit, trade and a fragile multilateralism.The urgent need to end the scourge of violence against women cannot be deferred, but must be ended now.“I will, on your behalf, represent an Ireland committed to a peaceful world and a shared planet and together we will ensure that Ireland’s voice matters.

Higgins.Of the nine elections held since the office of President was established in 1938, the 2018 poll will go down in history as the most insipid, vapid and instantly forgettable. The level of antipathy was borne out by the turnout, which was shockingly low. Until now the lowest turnout was 46.7 per cent for the 1997 election, which was in itself a lively enough affair. In 2011, when there were seven candidates, the turnout was 56 per cent.The low 2018 turnout cannot be wholly attributed to the fact there was an incumbent, Michael D Higgins, in the field. The 1966 campaign had a turnout of 64.7 per cent even though the sitting president, 84-year-old Eamon de Valera, decided not to campaign and RTÉ consequently - and bizarrely - decided not to report on the campaign at all. De Valera’s younger rival, 49-year-old Tom O’Higgins, ran a modern and energetic campaign. He emphasised the generation gap between de Valera and himself to good effect. Of course, he also had the backing of the second largest party, Fine Gael. The incumbent survived, but by less than 1 per cent. It did show that a sitting president could be vulnerable. Whatever about that theory, 2018 was never going to be the year where it was put to the test. This campaign never sparked. Early on, a limited number of controversies were uncovered. There were allegations of a jetset lifestyle enjoyed by the President, while another candidate became embroiled in a controversy involving the HPV vaccine. One candidate was reminded of a 1978 car accident, while another had to defend a loan from a businessman whose company was investigated for pyramid selling. There was also one particularly inflammatory issue: Travellers. But the debate just got clogged at those points and never properly flowed on from them. For a full month, the questions revolved around those narrow set of issues, like endless decades of the Rosary. “Now, it’s all changed. None of that made a difference. People did not give a fig that Higgins was flying to Belfast on the Learjet or about the allowance. They just didn’t care. None of those issues had any traction.”Sure, Peter Casey’s contentious comments on Travellers propelled him into a clear second place. Significant though that may have been, it was not the main narrative. Nor was the fact that Higgins is set to be elected on the first count with a huge personal vote. Or the significant setback for Sinn Féin with the underperformance of its candidate Liadh Ní Riada.The most significant factor was the low turnout and the ramifications it will have for the quality of Higgins’ mandate, and the status of the Office of President. From a long way out the strategy pursued by the Higgins’ team was a clever one, maximising his position and popularity, putting him out to the public one day as President and the next day as a presidential candidate. Here was a politician who could truly run with the hare and chase with the hound. But while it successfully ensured his re-election, it helped contribute to a process that was a non-event, with little interest generated among the public. Here was a popular incumbent up against opponents who were unknown, unproven and raw - undercard material, to be blunt about it. The fact that three of them - Casey, Sean Gallagher and Gavin Duffy - were Dragons’ Den panellists made it farcical. Joan Freeman seemed overwhelmed at times and was a single-issue candidate in a race where issues do not feature. Ní Riada’s main problem was that she did not have the profile and instant recognisability of the late Martin McGuinness who stood as the Sinn Féin candidate in 2011 - it was always going to be a struggle for her. Higgins may have limited his debate appearances, but he was never vulnerable to any of the attacks he faced, nor did he ever cede his status as the superior candidate.Ultimately, Higgins received two contradictory prizes: an overwhelming majority and an underwhelming mandate. As he approached the last year of his presidency, Higgins knew if he wanted to serve a second term, he had two potential problems to face. The first was his age: he would be 84 by the time his second term was completed. The second was an undertaking he made in 2011 - presumably based on his age - that he would serve only one term.For the second half of his presidency, Higgins had hinted at his desire to stand again. But the wheels were really set in motion at the Ploughing Championship in Co Offaly in September 2017. There, during an interview with Seán O’Rourke, he gave a strong indication he would seek a second term: “I am going to give the job my full concentration and will make an announcement after the summer next year.”His reasoning: a simple change of mind. Plus, even though he was now 77, he felt healthier now than he did at 70. And he also argued there were new challenges that were not apparent in 2011 that he was best equipped to handle as Head of State, including Brexit and climate change. There were a small number of backbench TDs and Senators in the two biggest parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, who believed he was reneging on a promise and wanted to run a candidate against him. However, even in late 2017, the leadership of both parties had little inclination of going to all the bother of running a costly campaign to take on a popular president. There were some “noises off”. Last autumn, Independent Senator Gerard Craughwell said he would begin a search to find an Independent candidate to take on Higgins. The name of the RTÉ presenter, Miriam O’Callaghan, who had reportedly toyed with a run in 2011 was again being mentioned - but she ruled it out early. Meanwhile, Higgins was beginning to lay the groundwork. The volume of pubic engagements increased during the latter half of 2017 and into 2018. That was particularly noticeable in August - there were no holidays this year. A number of other strategic decisions were taken early. As former president Mary McAleese had done, Higgins waited until late summer before announcing his candidature - he did it during July. It was unusual for a sitting President to be involved in an election. Higgins decided he would continue with a full Presidential programme (where he would appear as President) and conduct a parallel campaign as a candidate. Thus his status after September 25th would change from day to day. An adviser to a rival said: “The prime example of it was Ballinasloe Horse Fair. All the other candidates arrived down and were bombarded with testy questions. But Michael D Higgins was there as President and so he could get maximum publicity without the need to answer any questions. He was having it both ways.”This is how another strategist for a losing rival assessed it: “The 12 months lead-in has been masterful. He has done nothing to cause a wobble on the throne. The justification for being dethroned lessened with each passing day.“The bonus was you were able to do all the presidential things while being a presidential candidate. I know you are being President in Croke Park but you are also waving live to 800,000 people. The inherent advantage there is priceless.”On the face of it, what happened in September 2018 was very familiar. We had seen it before, with presidential hopefuls doing the rounds of county councils seeking four nominations. There were complaints that Higgins had deployed the McAleese tactic of delaying announcing his intentions until the last possible moment, narrowing the timeframe for rivals. To be fair, Higgins’ intentions had been well known for some time. The problem was a logistical one. Councils were in recess during August. In addition, they were not in a position to nominate until the writ for the election was moved, and that did not happen until early September. It played out as it did in 2011. But the tenor and the atmosphere was not generating the same interest now as seven years ago. “It was a very different campaign back then,” says a key adviser for one of the candidates. “In 2011 we had 11 to 12 aspirants and they were whittled down to seven. The likes of Fergus Finlay Maireád McGuinness Pat Cox Gay Byrne and O’Callaghan were all being mentioned back then.“All that created a story before the story and kept interest levels high. Look at Fianna Fáil’s pursuit of Gay Byrne for example.”The adviser continued: “Here, the interest was marginal. I know Brexit, the Charleton Tribunal and the cervical cancer scandal rightly took priority. But the campaign never took off, either in the summer or the autumn. You could count on one hand the number of times the presidential election was the top item on the news.”Even though candidates being nominated by councils is relatively novel (Dana Rosemary Scallon was the first in 1997), local authorities now jealously guard that power. There was some intrigue during the summer about who would run. Fianna Fáil’s front bench had ruled out running a candidate and endorsed Higgins, as did Fine Gael Labour the Greens and the Social Democrats. Notwithstanding that, there was an effort by a Galway councillor to get Fianna Fáil’s Eamon O Cuív on the ballot paper, a move strongly pressed down by the leadership. Some other names were mentioned, including Craughwell, Senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh and Noel Whelan. But all were ruled out by summer’s end. A number of potential candidates had emerged by the end of August including Duffy and Freeman. In mid-September, Gallagher re-emerged onto the scene, followed by the third former Dragons’ Den panellist: Casey. Thus began the carousel of county council meetings. Gallagher had clearly come prepared. Within 24 hours of entering the race he had his four nominations secured: Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim and Wexford. There was almost unanimous support for him from Fianna Fáil, which quickly resulted in him being seen as that party’s proxy candidate. Unlike in 2011, he did not demur from the description. Meanwhile, Duffy and Freeman had also secured their four nominations within days. Duffy had won the support of Fine Gael TDs in Meath. He had previously chaired the party leadership debates between Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney. Despite denying any party affiliation, he too was perceived as a proxy candidate. Would anyone else join them? There were some marginal candidates, and more serious ones. Kevin Sharkey and Jimmy Smyth garnered some headlines. There was also the freelance journalist Gemma O’Doherty. Her belief in the conspiracy theory that the State was involved in the murder of crime reporter Veronica Guerin put paid to her chances. In Fingal County Council, the late journalist’s brother, Councillor Jimmy Guerin, described her allegations as hurtful, offensive and “disgusting”.“In 22 years only two people I have come across say John Gilligan is not responsible for Veronica’s murder: one is John Gilligan. The other is Gemma O’Doherty,” he said. With Duffy’s nomination, that looked to be that. But that was when Casey announced his arrival. He had entered the race late, because he had fallen ill in the US and had been in hospital until early September. Upon his return, some of his early addresses to councils were unfocused and unpolished. He also made a few strange promises, including one to donate his pay to councils. In his address to Dublin City Council he said both his parents were alcoholics, before quickly correcting himself: “Sorry, workaholics.” Independent councillor Mannix Flynn retorted: “Same thing. You couldn’t make this up.”It was at this meeting that joke candidate Bunty Twuntingdon McFuff made her first appearance, with an outrageous pink outfit and even more outrageous comments, that sent up the whole process. Bunty would later make a cameo appearance on the Claire Byrne Live debate on October 19th when she started (unfunny) heckling from the audience but was shut down quickly by Byrne, who would have none of it. Meanwhile, Sinn Féin officially endorsed Ní Riada on September 16th. She had been the frontrunner and was seen as the modern type of forward-looking politician Sinn Féin were now projecting under the leadership of Mary Lou McDonald. Ní Riada had a problem though. She might not have had the late McGuinness’ baggage, but neither did she have his national profile. Casey was getting traction, though. Councillors were keen to exercise their democratic powers, and Kerry and Clare both obliged on September 17th. By the following day he had secured the required four councils with backing from Tipperary and Limerick. There were now six candidates in the race. O’Doherty was the only person who was still seriously chasing a nomination. She got some of the distance in Kilkenny but it was soon clear she could not continue to go down this route. The only other way of getting a nomination was to get the backing of 20 Oireachtas members. That had proved difficult in the past - Eamon Ryan of the Greens in 2004 and Independent senator David Norris in 2011 had both failed to muster support in that manner, although Norris did get the backing of four local authorities seven years ago.Now Craughwell and the Roscommon-Galway TD Michael Fitzmaurice, who had been working on this for some months, were saying they might have the numbers to back a candidate. However, when they met on the night of September 19th, it became obvious very quickly that it was not possible. They had 19 TDs and Senators but there was disagreement over the voting system, and some said there were some candidates they would not support in any circumstance. In the last few days before the close of nominations on September 26th, O’Doherty tried herself to win over 20 Oireachtas members but fell short. The die was cast. For well over a year, a small number of parliamentarians had been trying to prevent a “coronation” for Higgins by forcing an election. Part of this exercise was to raise questions about the cost of the Presidency and how its funding was being spent. By virtue of its Constitutional status, the Office of the President is not answerable to the Oireachtas or to the Courts. Nor had it been included in Freedom of Information legislation. That meant that Áras spending was opaque to the public. Craughwell claimed the President had stayed in a hotel earlier this year in Geneva that cost €3,000 per night. There were also questions about expenses and allowances. To counter this, during the summer, some details had been posted on the President’s website setting out funding and expenditure in the Áras. But it was skeletal and scant and really provided no real information on how public money was being spent. It was in this context that the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) decided to look at funding and governance in the President’s Office on September 25th, the day before nominations closed. Supporters of Higgins, including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, protested, inferring it was a political witch hunt. The secretary general of Government, Martin Fraser, nominally the accounting officer for the Áras, wrote to the committee suggesting such an inquiry might be unconstitutional. The PAC, and its chairman Seán Fleming, disregarded the suggestion and pressed on. It was at PAC’s next meeting that the additional unaudited allowance of €317,000 per annum paid to the President became public knowledge. It also emerged that an audit committee for the Presidency had not met for nearly four years: Fraser agreed that that situation was “suboptimal”. Some PAC members made hay of it. Fianna Fáil TD Marc MacSharry suggested the €317,000 could give rise to “the perception of a slush fund”. It was a loaded phrase that was immediately slapped down by Fine Gael member Kate O’Connell. But it stuck. And that €317,000 issue was to follow Higgins as tenaciously as his Bernese Mountain dogs, Bród and Síoda, for the rest of the campaign.The so-called “slush” fund dominated Higgins’ first press conference the following Wednesday. He explained it had been set at that level (€317,000) since 1998 and had been available to his predecessor McAleese. He gave some details of how it was spent, primarily to host events for the 20,000 visitors to the Áras. But he declined to make public the full figures until after the election. Higgins stuck to that line, claiming it would give him comfort to disclose everything, but the proper presidential thing to do was to wait until after the election, otherwise a precedent would be set. In the meantime, how the money was spent remained a mystery. Casey, who made several outlandish claims, even made a video suggesting €10,000 a year was being spent on the two dogs for grooming. Ahead of Higgins’ launch a person had broken into the Áras. Casey went so far as to say it was a stunt. Later both Casey and Higgins would have the most barbed clashes of the debates, with Higgins accusing Casey of having a “fantasy list”. In a robust exchange in the final debate, Higgins responded to Casey’s claims he was telling lies by replying his practice was “not to comment on people who say I am incapable of telling the truth”.Higgins has maintained he is not an extravagant person and the detailed breakdown of the €317,000, promised in November, will shed light on all that. A pattern was now emerging from all candidates that is familiar to presidential elections. Because the real powers are so limited, and the “soft powers” are so abstract, there is a undue focus on probity, to the exclusion of everything else. The media are also complicit in that.One of Higgins’ key strategists said it prevented all candidates from having any real chance of setting out their stall: “From our point of view we were frustrated that we could not get off trivial issues. It was all expenditure and allowances from beginning to end. Sure they were issues of public interest but they were hardly the defining quality of a president. “What is happening is they are taking the flaws of each of the candidates and amplifying them.”And that in a nutshell is what presidential campaigns in Ireland have become. Another aspect of note of Higgins’ launch was the huge number of campaign staff and volunteers he had, most of them from the Labour Party. Unlike the other candidates, who had tiny teams, his campaign ran an effective ground war, sending teams of canvassers out regularly in every constituency in the State. Incidentally, at least one past president did have extravagant notions when it came to lifestyle. Erskine Childers, elected in 1973, requested a heated swimming pool (which would have cost a colossal IR£100,000) and a squash court after his election. He also saw a IR£16,000 Daimler with sliding roof featured in Autocar magazine and told the Government of the day it would not be a “super expensive car”. Needless to say, the requests were all refused by the Department of Finance on cost grounds. By the time Senator Joan Freeman launched her campaign on October 1st, she was also under siege. Freeman had never stood for election. She was a Taoiseach’s nominee to the Seanad in 2016 and was best known for being the founder of suicide-prevention charity Pieta House and the Darkness into Light walk. Freeman struggled in the campaign. She was not a natural politician, or a natural debater, and struggled with areas outside her own interests - mental health and wellness - especially relating to the Constitutional role of the President. Her most effective line was that she was an ordinary person who was standing against four millionaires (Higgins was one of them) and a candidate supported by a big party (Ní Riada). In the early days of the campaign, she had to defend herself against claims she was involved with the Iona Institute (her sister is Theresa Lowe, and her niece is Maria Steen, both of whom campaigned for a No vote in the abortion referendum). She herself voted No. She said that two of her daughters had voted Yes and that she would not oppose signing the Bill into law if she were President. On October 1st, there was another looming issue. To fund her campaign, unlike others, Freeman had to get loans. One of them had come from a man called Des Walsh, whom she had briefly dated 40 years ago before losing touch with him. He was now a successful businessman in the US and he had loaned her €120,000, with the Standards in Public Office Commission insisting on a 9 per cent interest rate. But the company Walsh had headed, Herbalife, had paid a €200 million fine after being investigated for pyramid selling. Freeman said Walsh was retired and the money had come from his “personal wealth”, not from his company. When asked had she conducted background checks on him, or done due diligence, her response: “The fundamental question - sorry I might seem very shallow - what does he look like 40 years later? Is he married? Does he have children? Where does he live?”And that became her Achilles heel of the campaign.As it happened, Duffy launched his campaign the following day in a business centre in Smithfield, Dublin. He focused very much on his business acumen, claiming he would be the best candidate to be “deployed” to address the challenges posed by Brexit. Duffy remained a moderate voice during the campaign. He had an idea of setting up an Irish youth corps. He also shared his idea of the State holding on to AIB (something that had little to do with the Presidency). During the launch he claimed a clean record: “I am saying here you will not find anything in my track record. I know in my business there never has been a tax issue, a bad debt issue, I have never been involved in litigation.” In saying his record was clean, Duffy also referred to any questions that might relate to his personal life. Duffy and his wife Orlaith Carmody have four adult children. Turning to his wife at the launch, he said: “A big consideration for us entering the race, was there anything in our personal lives that could embarrass our children? There is not.”A few days later, the Mail on Sunday reported on an accident Duffy was involved in back in 1978, when he was 18, in which a young woman sustained a serious injury. He had two further driving offences, the most recent from 25 years ago. It was embarrassing but it was all from a long time ago. “I felt really sorry for Duffy,” said a member of Higgins’ camp. “The treatment he got about a car crash he was involved in when he was 18 or 19 was disproportionate.”It did not seem to have any lasting purchase. Duffy’s problem was this: When he entered the race, he had no idea Casey harboured ambitions. Plus, he had it on good authority that Gallagher would not contest this time. When all three got nominations, he readily accepted it was ridiculous, and said they diluted the potential of each other. It descended into near slapstick when the three former Dragons’ Den participants were placed side by side in the final Prime Time debate.“RTÉ said it drew lots but it was a farce. I’d like to meet the person who drew lots to draw my Lotto numbers for me,” a member of Duffy’s team said afterwards. Duffy stuck to his message but got little traction. It was another of the Dragons who would soon draw all the attention.For the first fortnight of the campaign, Ní Riada was off the national radar. Her campaign team focused on her Euro constituency and the Gaeltachtaí, and she did a lot of local radio. The idea was a ground war first before working on a national profile. Ní Riada had a lot going for her. She became a member of the party within the last decade and that meant “less IRA stuff coming up”, as one Sinn Féin person put it. This campaign was a bit different. The campaign was run from her bus, with a small team. And the Sinn Féin leadership was mostly absent from the campaign. That was strange. The party is to the political doughnut what Krispy Kreme is to the sweet doughnut. You would expect McDonald and Northern leader Michelle O’Neill to be constants. But they were more absent than present. Party people maintain that McDonald was instrumental in ensuring the membership supported the candidature. One of Ní Riada’s big goals was to mainstream the unity debate and her strategists believe that worked to a certain extent, even though it was a “bit messy” to get messages across in a crowded field. Like other candidates, there were plenty of stones in her shoes. She was constantly asked about her stance on the HPV vaccine following a “naive” Facebook questioning of it in 2016. She also struggled in justifying that the €47,000 net she took home was anywhere near the average industrial wage. Her late arrival into Sinn Féin did not help her escape questions about the North - she came under pressure on the Máiría Cahill case and also on her refusal to describe IRA atrocities as acts of terrorism. Against that, she said during the Claire Byrne debate she would be willing to wear a poppy. That gesture did not go down well with some Sinn Féin representatives, however, who would never wear it under any circumstances. Did disappearing for two weeks at the start make it harder for a relative unknown to be known? The support levels, well below the party’s average, suggest that poor choices were made along the line. There was huge focus on the broadcast debates, given how pivotal they had been in 2011, especially the explosive Frontline debate that changed the course of the election. While they attracted huge audiences - 900,000 for the final Prime Time debate - nobody particularly distinguished themselves or disgraced themselves. Higgins agreed to participate in three, a radio debate with Cormac O hEadhra, and two TV debates - one hosted by Pat Kenny on Virgin Media One and the other hosted by David McCullagh on RTÉ. Listening back to the debates, it was uncanny that the same tiny set of questions mostly recurred. It was like playing a game of Cluedo where the only possible suspicion allowed was Colonel Mustard in the Conservatory with the candlestick.The impact of the absence of Higgins from the Claire Byrne debate was negated by the decision of Gallagher not to participate. Still, it was here that Ó Riada said she would wear a poppy. It was during the Ó hEadhra debate that Casey first said that the President had taken a Learjet from Dublin to Belfast. The jet incident and the Traveller controversy played out fully in the debates chaired by Pat Kenny on Virgin Media One and RTÉ’s David McCullagh.Casey’s stump line was that he had lived a third of his life in Ireland, a third in Australia, and a third in the US. No guessing which of those cultures he imported as he embarked on his presidential campaign. His first tweet showed him hitting a golf ball into the Atlantic as he said this would be the only driver he would bring to the Áras. The straight-off-the-bat stuff comes directly from hyper-partisan US politics. He was criticising a report (unconfirmed) the president took his official drivers abroad with him. It was clear that Casey was not going to indulge in any soft-shoe shuffle criticism of Higgins, who others were treating as a designated national treasure. At his launch he said the only good thing Higgins had done was meet the Queen. He went on to say he had been a wonderful president at the start but had stopped being wonderful about three years ago. He used as evidence figures which suggested a sharp drop-off in public appearances after the first year, of 42 per cent. It was the first of many direct attacks Casey made on the President. The most direct related to Higgins using the jet to go to Belfast. Some others were fanciful. He claimed Higgins had objected to Traveller housing in Galway in 1968. That was another politician with the same name, Micheál Ó hUiginn. He also suggested the Áras intruder might be a stunt, and even put out an attack ad on Twitter claiming €10,000 was spent each year on dog grooming. What catapulted Casey into the public consciousness was a podcast he did with Independent News and Media in which he lambasted a Travelling family in Co Tipperary for refusing to move into a €1.7 million estate of six houses built especially for them. He claimed they had demanded stables and paddocks and said their attitude was a disgrace, given the homeless crisis in Dublin. He also refused to accept that Travellers had a separate ethnic identity and, most provocatively, claimed that house values fell when Travellers moved into an area. The comments were met by angry response but instead of backing down Casey doubled down on them. “There is far too much political correctness in this society,” he said.In that night’s TV debate on Virgin Media One, Gallagher accused him of making a “racist comment” when he said encouraging Travellers to be separate was “like giving chocolate to a diabetic”. “I don’t think they are a different race at all so how can that be racist,” he replied. The following day, Thursday, he travelled to the hamlet outside Thurles to view the estate. It was the biggest media moment of the campaign. There was a big contingent of media and also of gardaí. Casey faced tough questioning from reporters and was accused of partaking in a stunt. He took great exception to that. He also declined to meet the local family. They came to the estate afterwards and criticised him for not meeting them. They also accused him of being racist. Casey shipped a lot of flak overnight for his comments and his visit to Cabragh Bridge. Then on Friday morning came a bombshell, a statement from Casey saying he was taking the weekend to consider whether to withdraw or stay in the race. In an emotional interview with Áine Lawlor on RTÉ Radio, he again denied there is a racist bone in his body, but also conceded he had not realised that Traveller ethnicity had been officially recognised in 2017. However, by Sunday, Casey was back in the race, buoyed up by 1,300 supportive emails he said he had received. There was an element of dogwhistle politics to it. Casey had tapped into a section of the community who have antipathy to Travellers. And it was bigger than many had thought, even though he was probably also a repository for angry voters. The distance between Dublin and Belfast is about 165 kilometres according to Google Maps, and the journey takes about one hour and 43 minutes if you are not impeded by traffic. In the first radio debate on October 13th, Casey claimed Higgins had used the jet to go to Belfast, which probably saved him no more than half an hour to 40 minutes each way. Higgins was nonplussed and gave an answer to a question that was not asked, saying he had only used the helicopter 14 times in seven years. The story receded then until Higgins was asked about it during his second live debate, with Kenny, the following Wednesday. He cited security reasons, saying there was no transfer by road available at the border. And so that might have lain until the following weekend, when it was disclosed the PSNI had no issue with escorts and security. The following day, there was a subtle shift in explanation, with Higgins saying: “I take the advice from my office and my office judges these trips in terms of… logistics and security.”No reference to the PSNI. Front-runner Higgins was repeatedly criticised for using the Government jet for a trip to Belfast during the final presidential debate involving all six candidates. This issue led to some prolonged clashes in the final TV debate. Casey accused him of “being untruthful” on the issue. Higgins said taking the jet allowed him to fulfil a very busy schedule that day. His account was inconsistent but it made little difference. With others talking over one another, he emerged from the debate relatively unscathed. It was a strange and anti-climatic ending to the campaign. The viewing figures were high but the social media engagements fell dramatically as the weeks progressed. The social media figures generally were on the low side.According to Stephen O’Leary, head of social media monitoring company Olytico there were five significant spikes in conversation on Twitter.“They coincided with the radio debate, and the four televised debates. The biggest of these spikes came during the last televised debate during which over 20,000 tweets were published.”Even then that was not huge. Generally, says O’Leary there were “without question, low levels of conversation. You would attribute that to the fact that it has been a one-horse race. “You have a popular incumbent like Michael D Higgins and a field with no stand-outs.”Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3678310.1540650945!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"michael d higgins vs peter casey some perspective is important","story":"Arriving at the Dublin count at the Convention Centre, Independent candidate Peter Casey says he will run for president again - unless he is Taoiseach at the time of the next presidential election.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t President Michael D Higgins: he won with a resounding majority, the largest ever in a national election. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe    The most important fact of the presidential election is that Michael D Higgins won with a resounding majority, the largest ever in a national election.There has been, and continues to be, an understandably intense focus on the 20-odd per cent that Peter Casey secured in the election. Fair enough: that 20 per cent is important. But the other 80 per cent is important too, no?And that overwhelming majority was dominated by the huge vote for Higgins – an intellectual, a socialist, a man of letters, a man of the left.He has also been a career politician, a democrat and a parliamentarian – someone who has dedicated his life to advancing his social and political goals through the routes of parliamentary politics and public advocacy.Someone who has been content to work our democratic system, even if he has always been impatient with it. Someone who has made the compromises that come with power and so managed to leave a legacy of enduring achievement. Someone conspicuously happy with the status and dignity of the highest office and determined to use it as a rhetorical platform.For all the venom directed at our established way of doing politics and government, someone who is very much of that world has just won 56 per cent of the vote. Casey won 21 per cent. So, you know some perspective is important here.Casey is enjoying his moment in the sun on Saturday. He might found a new party. Or join one. He might stand for office. He might not. He’ll let us know soon. He might run for president again, if he’s not taoiseach. (Sure maybe he could do both?)Students should be able to live on university campuses. People should be able get on the housing ladder. We are too focused on Dublin. We should use the networks of the diaspora. It’s a disgrace that elderly women are on hospital trolleys. And so on and so on, brain-farting out soundbites and platitudes.This isn’t the rise of a new political force. It’s taxi-driver stuff. It’s the end of the bar in the golf club after a long day. It’s Ross O’Carroll-Kelly’s dad with a Derry accent.This was a second order election with a low turnout and a result that was a foregone conclusion. It is the latest indication that there is always – always – a protest vote, a two-fingers to the establishment vote (Sinn Féin gets a chunk of it, usually so do Independents).Do you really think Casey will be a significant figure in our politics in six months? In six weeks? Like Dana is? Like Declan Ganley is? If there was a space for a right-wing, conservative, law and order, low taxes party, then what happened to Renua?That is not to say that Casey’s vote is without significance. It is not. A fifth of the voters is a lot of voters, and despite the candidate’s disavowals on Saturday morning that raising the Traveller issue had contributed to his surge, it’s pretty clear that it did. The Traveller thing was the trigger for him, allowing him to break away from the Higgins challengers, amplifying his voice and focusing his campaigning appeal.Political analysis often makes the rhetorical mistake of seeking one simple answer to what are actually quite complex questions. But the question of why Casey did so well does not just have one answer, it has several Travellers are certainly part of it, but just part of it.Other parts include the traditional protest vote. And the general humpiness of many voters – feeling squeezed by the cost of living, under pressure from everything, running faster and faster just to stand still – is part of that picture.That and the sense among voters that they had a free pass to give anyone and everyone a kick in this election, from which no direct effects on their daily lives were possible, as the President does not do budgets or make social policy.But whatever the exact composition of the Casey vote, it is certain that parties and candidates will be looking closely at it. Casey’s comments about Travellers and the welfare state will no doubt embolden a hundred cheaper imitations in the local elections to come next year.Anyone who thinks that antipathy to Travellers – some of it rooted in prejudice, some of it in response to bad behaviour by some Travellers – is something new in Ireland hasn’t been listening very closely.But it has not been widespread in politics. As a result of this election, that may begin to change. What usually happens is not that a new vehicle emerges for these views – but that the existing parties assimilate them.There is no reason to think it will be different this time. This election has not turned the world upside down. But it will have effects on our politics.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":null,"title":"picture editors 25 favourite images princess eugenies royal","story":"Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank kiss after their wedding on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor CastleUCL rugby team disciplined over sexist chant on night outPittsburgh synagogue shooting: Gunman kills 11 people in \u0026#39deadliest anti-Semitic attack in US\u0026#39Former England football manager Glenn Hoddle \u0026#39responding well\u0026#39 to treatment after collapsing at BT studiosStrictly Come Dancing 2018 Hallowe\u0026#39en Special: Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer tied at top with highest scores of seriesChristmas losing its sparkle as shops cut ranges of glittery cards, wrap and crackersMillennial brides want their bridesmaids to wear white as the concept of \u0026#39being upstaged\u0026#39 is dying outExclusive Philip Hammond interview: Budget plan to get UK’s broadband up to speed  Labour accused of plotting to hold up no-deal Brexit preparationsSenior Brexiteers are expressing \u0026#39strong interest\u0026#39 in a \u0026#39plan B\u0026#39 for Brexit Ministers pledge to reform NDAs in wake of Sir Philip Green scandalComment: There\u0026#39s a surprisingly simple way to destroy the cult of Corbyn: abolish PAYE\u0026#39Unscrupulous\u0026#39 essay mill companies are using social media to tempt students into cheatingBritain\u0026#39s forgotten watermen to be remembered for their wartime sacrificeHow pipe bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc\u0026#39s social media posts show his rapid descent into extremismComment: Britain\u0026#39s wretched civil service is medievally enslaved to EU mastersComment: European courts risk corroding free speech to create special status for IslamComment: \u0026#39Sir Philip Green once said that I needed to be careful not to have an accident\u0026#39Crown producer to make film about 1970 Miss World protests staring Keira Knightley seven years after it was first rejectedWhen do the clocks go back, why do we use GMT – and will the EU soon put an end to \u0026#39falling back\u0026#39?Comment: Fashion industry insiders on Sir Philip Green: \u0026#39He lives and behaves like an emperor – it’s his way or else’We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177653497_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc legal correspondent wrong say nda signed freely","story":"BBC legal correspondent criticised for saying NDA was signed freely Court of AppealThe BBC has been told it is “inaccurate” to claim that women who entered into non-disclosure agreements after they had made allegations about sexual harassment did so “freely”.Media and employment lawyers have said it is likely there would be an “imbalance of power” during negotiations to settle a claim and therefore it was incorrect to view these contractual relationships as free of “abuse”.Yesterday, a BBC journalist claimed the judgment by the Court of Appeal “made clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure”.

IndependentAsda is set to begin consulting with staff over potential job cuts, and could slash 2,500 roles next year. Job cuts would probably affect Asda’s petrol, bakery, back office and “hosting” operations, as well as roles in its clothing arm, George, according to Press Association. In a statement, the company said: “In a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them\u0026nbspand, inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do, or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores.Asda cuts price of petrol by 2p a litreAsda customers steal shopping baskets to avoid paying for bags What removal of Asda price guarantee scheme will mean for shoppers“We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers.“We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren’t easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them.”The GMB union said Asda’s decision to announce potential job cuts just two months before Christmas was a bad one. Gary Carter, the union’s national officer,\u0026nbspsaid: “These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run up to Christmas, is doubly appalling.”He added: “Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company. “These cuts make no sense whatsoever – slashing our members’ jobs would hurt the service ASDA customers receive. GMB will fight tooth and nail for every single job.“With all the speculation surrounding the proposed Sainsbury’s merger and potential sell offs of stores – this news will not put anyone’s mind at rest.”Asda and Sainsbury’s announced plans for a £10bn tie-up in April\u0026nbspand the deal is being scrutinised by the competition watchdog.Last month, Asda announced it was scrapping its price guarantee scheme, which gave customers money off if the cost of their shop was not 10 per cent cheaper than if bought at a rival chain. The company said at the time: “It’s a decision we’ve not taken lightly because we love it dearly, but in reality, we know our customers don’t love it enough for us to keep it.“Instead they want us to focus our investment on lowering our prices, and they’ll let us know if we’re falling out of step with the competition.”In July, the supermarket said it was entering into consultation with colleagues at its Enfield Home Shopping Centre in London, putting 261 jobs at risk.

Firms including BP, Rio Tinto and Volkswagen, are facing calls to reconsider their ties to lobbying organisations whose climate change policies do not match up to the targets set out by the Paris Agreement. Investors have written to 55 companies in total, asking them to “review the lobbying positions being adopted by the organisations of which you are a member”, particularly any groups which might oppose progressive climate change policies. Some of the other businesses that have been approached include Unilever, Nestle and Rolls-Royce. The 55 firms have been chosen due to their high greenhouse gas emissions and “significant role in energy intensive sectors”, investors said, and the decision to take action on “back-door” lobbying comes weeks after the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe.He may have accepted it but Trump will do nothing about climate changeClimate change to cause global beer shortage, research showsBanks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEGovernment urged to act fast on climate change after UN warningUnder current climate commitments by world leaders, the Earth will be 3C warmer by the end of the century, according to the IPCC’s report. However, the worst effects of global warming - including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities - will only be avoided if the global temperature increase stays below 1.5C, a figure the scientists think will be exceeded within around 20 years. Adam Matthews, director of ethics \u0026amp engagement, Church of England Pensions Board, said: “Misleading and misaligned corporate lobbying practices undermine the ability of governments to act on climate change and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The influence of trade associations is often exerted behind closed doors and can be deeply insidious to public policy making on climate change. “As the recent report from the IPCC clearly highlighted, the stakes are high and time is against us. It is therefore right that investors are challenging Europe’s most high-emitting companies to ensure consistency in their lobbying practices.”Stephanie Pfeiffer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said: “Long-term investors have a clear interest in the Paris Agreement being implemented to support the necessary transition to a low-carbon global economy. Shareholders should rightly expect companies in which they invest to advocate for the climate policy required for this to happen. This includes ensuring the trade bodies of which they are members are working to the same end.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He was born in the Kerala region of southern India and his parents roamed the country working for the government as part of the rubber board. Then his father decided to go into the private sector, setting up as a producer of adhesives. “My dad wasn’t the best entrepreneur,” Janardana says. His father had no difficulty obtaining a line, or lines,\u0026nbspof credit – but not from entirely reputable sources. He was being charged 10 per cent per week i.e. a higher rate of interest than Wonga\u0026nbspused to levy. Labelling his father’s lenders\u0026nbsploan sharks is unfair to sharks. “Debt collection is not exactly regulated in India,” says Janardana the younger. “People were lining up outside the house screaming at us to give them their money back.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt was the son who paid them all off in the end. He studied engineering, worked in telecoms, rolling out the network in India, then went to business school, was hired by Capital One, and started in its credit card office in Washington DC. Fortunately the exchange rate of dollars to rupees was favourable at the time. Junior, then aged 24, salvaged the family finances. In April 2008, I was labelled a party\u0026nbsppooper. People said ‘it’s only a Wall Street\u0026nbspcrisis. It’s a US thing. We’re not in the\u0026nbspsubprime\u0026nbspmortgage business’“It’s more about reputation – face and respect – in India,” he says. “Sometimes your parents’ social security is you. To be fair, they wouldn’t have incurred so much debt if not for me. I was living off them for a long while.” In the wake of that traumatic experience, and while working for Capital One, lending to consumers, and having responsibility for collections and defaults, Janardana could feel defaulters’ pain. He was abnormally sensitive to any looming crisis. The year 2007 found him based in London. “We were all gung-ho for growth,” he says. But Janardana pointed out even when the economy was doing well, losses were piling up, and he forecast rocky times ahead.“In April 2008, I was labelled a party pooper. People said ‘it’s only a Wall Street crisis. It’s a US thing. We’re not in the subprime mortgage business’.” But Janardana’s warning was heeded and by September 2008, when everything unravelled, Capital One\u0026nbsphad a head start of three or four months, and had already shut down new custom\u0026nbspand reduced exposure. Still, “it wasn’t a fun time. Most of 2008 was spent just trying to survive.” By that\u0026nbsptime,\u0026nbspJanardana had decided not to return to the US, and to become a British citizen. Zopa attracted him because it was something completely different: a\u0026nbsp“peer-to-peer” system\u0026nbspin which investors and borrowers are brought together for mutual advantage, with Zopa in the middle, like the shaded area of a Venn diagram. One person’s loan is another’s investment. Investors do better than they would by parking money in a bank – albeit with higher risk – and borrowers get a much better deal than Janardana’s entrepreneurial father ever did. The typical borrowers are teachers and nurses in their mid-30s, often for the purpose of home improvements or buying a car. The average loan size is just under £10,000. With his engineering background, the thing that particularly pleased Janardana was how Zopa had managed to speed up the process of obtaining a loan. The business does its own risk assessment. But what really concentrated minds, was the question of comparison sites. Zopa had previously informed applicants if they could get a loan in 27 seconds flat. But Money Supermarket said approval had to be 12 seconds for it to show up on its site – Zopa got it down to seven. The exact rate is outlined within three minutes. “The real rate,” stresses Janardana, “not the ‘lowest rate’ – which is so misleading.” Janardana has been CEO since August 2015. “We’ve had a charmed four years,” he says. The business\u0026nbsphad a turnover of £265m in 2014-15, now it’s more than £1bn. Revenue has gone up from £11m to £45m. Customer satisfaction, according to Trust Pilot, hits 4.8 or 4.9 out of 5. Now Zopa is two years into building a fully-fledged online bank, and is running the registration gauntlet, performing the required stress tests. It\u0026nbspwants to “extend the ethos of peer-to-peer into retail banking”.The average amount people borrow from ZopaWe are sitting in the Zopa HQ on the south bank of the Thames, looking out at the river flowing languidly by, with the towers of the City leaning over it. It’s probably something to do with his personal history, and his mum and dad nearly going under, but when Janardana speaks of “giving customers more control”, it’s easy to feel the passion and conviction beyond the expression of good intentions. He objects to what he calls “the winlose model”. He ought to get a job as chancellor of the exchequer. In fact, he comes out with a line neither the chancellor – nor anyone else, other than Jeff Bezos\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspgets a chance to say very often. “We had too much money”. In other words, there was more lending than borrowing. Citizens Advice\u0026nbspknows\u0026nbspcustomers who renew loans generally get a worse rate than those who switch. Banks make money by upping the rate. “We could have pulled the same trick, but we don’t want to do that,” says Janardana, sounding a bit like Chris Tarrant on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. “With us you always get the same rate as a new customer. A bank where we win, and our customers win.” Even if he is CEO, Janardana still talks regularly to the guy who handles “complaints”. He wants people to be happy and sometimes Janardana speaks more like a yoga teacher than a money expert. It’s rather zen and soothing. “I want,” he says, “to take away the points of tension.”A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Job cuts would probably affect Asda’s petrol, bakery, back office and “hosting” operations, as well as roles in its clothing arm, George, according to Press Association. In a statement, the company said: “In a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them\u0026nbspand, inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do, or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores.Asda cuts price of petrol by 2p a litreAsda customers steal shopping baskets to avoid paying for bags What removal of Asda price guarantee scheme will mean for shoppers“We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers.“We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren’t easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them.”The GMB union said Asda’s decision to announce potential job cuts just two months before Christmas was a bad one. Gary Carter, the union’s national officer,\u0026nbspsaid: “These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run up to Christmas, is doubly appalling.”He added: “Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company. “These cuts make no sense whatsoever – slashing our members’ jobs would hurt the service ASDA customers receive. GMB will fight tooth and nail for every single job.“With all the speculation surrounding the proposed Sainsbury’s merger and potential sell offs of stores – this news will not put anyone’s mind at rest.”Asda and Sainsbury’s announced plans for a £10bn tie-up in April\u0026nbspand the deal is being scrutinised by the competition watchdog.Last month, Asda announced it was scrapping its price guarantee scheme, which gave customers money off if the cost of their shop was not 10 per cent cheaper than if bought at a rival chain. The company said at the time: “It’s a decision we’ve not taken lightly because we love it dearly, but in reality, we know our customers don’t love it enough for us to keep it.“Instead they want us to focus our investment on lowering our prices, and they’ll let us know if we’re falling out of step with the competition.”In July, the supermarket said it was entering into consultation with colleagues at its Enfield Home Shopping Centre in London, putting 261 jobs at risk.

Firms including BP, Rio Tinto and Volkswagen, are facing calls to reconsider their ties to lobbying organisations whose climate change policies do not match up to the targets set out by the Paris Agreement. Investors have written to 55 companies in total, asking them to “review the lobbying positions being adopted by the organisations of which you are a member”, particularly any groups which might oppose progressive climate change policies. Some of the other businesses that have been approached include Unilever, Nestle and Rolls-Royce. The 55 firms have been chosen due to their high greenhouse gas emissions and “significant role in energy intensive sectors”, investors said, and the decision to take action on “back-door” lobbying comes weeks after the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe.He may have accepted it but Trump will do nothing about climate changeClimate change to cause global beer shortage, research showsBanks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEGovernment urged to act fast on climate change after UN warningUnder current climate commitments by world leaders, the Earth will be 3C warmer by the end of the century, according to the IPCC’s report. However, the worst effects of global warming - including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities - will only be avoided if the global temperature increase stays below 1.5C, a figure the scientists think will be exceeded within around 20 years. Adam Matthews, director of ethics \u0026amp engagement, Church of England Pensions Board, said: “Misleading and misaligned corporate lobbying practices undermine the ability of governments to act on climate change and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The influence of trade associations is often exerted behind closed doors and can be deeply insidious to public policy making on climate change. “As the recent report from the IPCC clearly highlighted, the stakes are high and time is against us. It is therefore right that investors are challenging Europe’s most high-emitting companies to ensure consistency in their lobbying practices.”Stephanie Pfeiffer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said: “Long-term investors have a clear interest in the Paris Agreement being implemented to support the necessary transition to a low-carbon global economy. Shareholders should rightly expect companies in which they invest to advocate for the climate policy required for this to happen. This includes ensuring the trade bodies of which they are members are working to the same end.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The lender reported a 10 per cent increase in profits in the third quarter, up to £961m from £871m in the same period of 2017.\u0026nbspIn the year so far, the bank said profit is £2.8bn.Mr McEwan\u0026nbspsaid: “This is a good performance, set against a highly competitive market and an uncertain economic outlook. “We are growing lending in our target markets and are in a strong position to support the economy.

The settlement allowed the UK government to resume selling off its stake in the bank, which it has held since it bailed out RBS during the crisis.

Amazon shares dropped as much as 8 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported quarterly sales of $56.58bn (£44.16bn), missing expectations of $57.1bn. Alphabet’s stock fell 4.7 per cent after it posted revenue of $33.74bn, missing Wall Street’s target of $34.04bn, although earnings of $13.06 per share came in well ahead of the expected $10.42 per share. Google reveals it has sacked 48 employees over sexual harassmentGoogle leak reveals plans for censored search engine in ChinaEbay sues Amazon, accusing rival of illegally poaching sellersAmazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employees“Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing. “But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.”Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “poorly received” earnings from Alphabet and Amazon had “soured the mood on what had been a rebounding US session”. However, Christopher Rossbach, CIO of investment firm J. Stern \u0026amp Co, said the companies both remain fundamentally strong, despite missing market expectations. “While their revenues were both slightly lower than expected, with Amazon additionally guiding slightly lower than street expectations for the next quarter, they still both show good profitability,” he said. \u0026nbsp“Alphabet is the leader in search and advertising, and Amazon is the leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, and increasingly benefits from advertising too. The fundamentals of both companies are intact and we believe that any significant weakness is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.”Other tech stocks that dipped in after-hours include Apple, which fell 1.6 per cent, and Twitter, which was down 2.5 per cent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s not about them -\u0026nbspthe character -\u0026nbspbut the character imposed by the designer.”Vodianova – who was the world’s third highest earning model in 2012 and is currently ranked by models as one of the fashion industry’s New Supers – said the proliferation of social media has changed\u0026nbspthe whole fashion industry.“For young models, it’s really, really hard. It’s really hard without this following. I know a lot of brands are asking models how many followers they have – this dictates whether they get the job or not.\u0026nbsp“It’s interesting because that means personality is celebrated and it’s not really about the brand\u0027s\u0026nbspideal of the, let’s say, face. It’s crazy because very beautiful girls, or whatever that means, will miss out and the job will go out to someone who is very charismatic and funny and has a lot of personality. Some people find it unfair but I think it’s interesting.”The model, who does a range of campaigning work, noted the “competitive” nature of this shift but said it allowed for a greater ersity of models.She argued the growing influence of social media has led the industry to embrace a greater range of body shapes but it still had a long way to go.“A lot of it is forced by social media and by the fact more and more of these conversations are surfacing. The industry sort of follows it like a trend. Unfortunately, it is\u0026nbspstill not normalised enough.“The issues of one type of body and perfection are changing a lot because we now see consumers wanting to see more ersity,” she added. “Big influencers and the brands themselves now have a great presence on social media so they can hear from their consumers directly about what works and what does not.

It’s very interesting.”But she said the issue of body ersity has yet to revolutionise the world of catwalk high fashion – noting such designers create their clothes with slim women in mind.\u0026nbsp“That is the way they want to see it. But then often what is in the catwalk is not what you find in the shop,” she said.Asked whether she thought this provided a negative role model for young girls, she said the responsibility needed to lie with designers rather than the models themselves.Created with Sketch.Model with Down\u0027s syndrome makes strides worldwide Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Model Madeline Stuart, who has Down\u0027s syndrome,  standing on a runway during rehearsal at the Angel Orensanz Foundation during New York Fashion Week Madeline having her final touches made before before walking in the Colleen Morris presentation of the SpringSummer 2019 collection during London Fashion WeekMadeline has her makeup applied backstage before the Colleen Morris Presentation Madeline enjoying her time backstage of the Soiree show at London Fashion WeekMadeline walking onto the catwalk for the Colleen Morris presentation Madeline and her mother, Rosanne, pose for photos while sightseeing in Trafalgar Square Madeline walking in the Swedish School of Textiles show at London Fashion WeekMadeline celebrates after stepping out of a taxi cab as she arrives for New York Fashion WeekMadeline looks through a window as her mother is interviewed about Madeline\u0027s modelling careerRosanne Stuart attempts to cover her daughter, Madeline, from rain as they walk to a show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline waits backstage as a dress is steamed before a runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline having her make up applied backstage before walking in the Lulu Et Gigi presentation at New York Fashion WeekMadeline being assisted backstage before walking in the Rutu Bhonsle runway show at New York Fashion WeekMadeline standing backstage before walking in the Burning Guitars runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline standing backstage between two male models at New York Fashion WeekMadeline stands among models backstage after walking in the Burning Guitars presentation during New York Fashion WeekMadeline sits at the Remedy Diner with her mother and manager Rosanne after walking in a runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline sits in the back of a taxi cab after walking in a runway show during New York Fashion WeekModel Madeline Stuart, who has Down\u0027s syndrome,  standing on a runway during rehearsal at the Angel Orensanz Foundation during New York Fashion Week Madeline having her final touches made before before walking in the Colleen Morris presentation of the SpringSummer 2019 collection during London Fashion WeekMadeline has her makeup applied backstage before the Colleen Morris Presentation Madeline enjoying her time backstage of the Soiree show at London Fashion WeekMadeline walking onto the catwalk for the Colleen Morris presentation Madeline and her mother, Rosanne, pose for photos while sightseeing in Trafalgar Square Madeline walking in the Swedish School of Textiles show at London Fashion WeekMadeline celebrates after stepping out of a taxi cab as she arrives for New York Fashion WeekMadeline looks through a window as her mother is interviewed about Madeline\u0027s modelling careerRosanne Stuart attempts to cover her daughter, Madeline, from rain as they walk to a show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline waits backstage as a dress is steamed before a runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline having her make up applied backstage before walking in the Lulu Et Gigi presentation at New York Fashion WeekMadeline being assisted backstage before walking in the Rutu Bhonsle runway show at New York Fashion WeekMadeline standing backstage before walking in the Burning Guitars runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline standing backstage between two male models at New York Fashion WeekMadeline stands among models backstage after walking in the Burning Guitars presentation during New York Fashion WeekMadeline sits at the Remedy Diner with her mother and manager Rosanne after walking in a runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline sits in the back of a taxi cab after walking in a runway show during New York Fashion Week“What is it to do with catwalk models? We can’t blame catwalk models.\u0026nbspThey are beautiful. And they are often very healthy. They are naturally skinny,” she said. “Whether there should be more ersity, that is another story. A lot of these girls and a lot of these models were born this way. I was born this way so I can speak on their behalf.”\u0026nbspShe called for a greater variety of female body types to be represented on the catwalk. “There will always be a place for girls who are naturally slim, but I would love to see more beautiful, curvy women on the catwalk. I see a lot of these shows and I think it should be more like in real life.”\u0026nbspVodianova joined the United Nations Population Fund to lead a global symposium on tackling the taboos surrounding women’s health around the world in Antalya in Turkey on Thursday and Friday of this week.“Too often women’s health issues go unheard and unnoticed because of unwarranted stigmas and taboos which have let far too many women down for generations,” she said.She said the global issue of period poverty was close to her heart – revealing she was subject to fierce trolling after sharing a photo of herself holding a sanitary pad with her two million Instagram followers.The model said she received\u0026nbsparound 5,000 comments in less than ten hours and\u0026nbspthe reaction of Russian women to the image was “crazy”.“Most of it was harsh criticism saying ‘How can you do this? There are teenagers following you.\u0026nbspWhy don’t you start posting pictures sitting on the toilet? Why don’t you post toilet paper?’ I could not believe my eyes. I am not used to so much hate and criticism thrown my way.”\u0026nbsp“Then I thought this is really cool actually.\u0026nbspiIt proves my point that these conversations are so important. I just did not realise this\u0026nbspshame and stigma was so close to home in Russia.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Everyone lapped it up and someone in a BBC boardroom smiled a very smug smile.Oh how we missed him!

Government policy seems stuck in reverse\u0027Click to followThe IndependentGreen campaigners have lined up to attack chancellor Philip Hammond for announcing a multi-billion-pound boost for building and upgrading roads – days after world scientists urgently warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut.In Monday’s budget, Mr Hammond is due to champion £30bn of funding for new roads and road repairs, hailing it “the biggest-ever cash injection for England’s largest roads”.\u0026nbspYet the chancellor is recycling an old Conservative party announcement, The Independent can reveal – and environmental experts including Greenpeace’s chief scientist said he should have done a U-turn on the party\u0027s earlier pledge.What will Phillip Hammond present in the budget?Hammond is ready to end austerity – if May agrees to his Brexit dealBanks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEGovernment urged to act fast on climate change after UN warningIt comes after the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned the world has 12 years in which to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. And earlier this month the government cut grants for electric cars and scrapped those for hybrids.Mr Hammond will say in his budget speech that a £28.8bn fund will be dedicated to strategically important roads such as motorways and major local routes, for improvements, upgrades and easing congestion under the plan, which covers 2020-25. Major new roads could be built too.He will also set aside extra cash to fix potholes, repair damaged roads, and trial new methods of transport such as electric bikes.But in the 2015 budget, then-chancellor George Osborne announced that for cars registered after April 2017, all vehicle excise duty would go to a new roads fund from 2020.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCar tax raises about £6bn\u0026nbspa year, and calculated across the five years of Mr Hammond’s plan for 2020-25, amounts to £30bn – the sum he will be trumpeting in the budget.Publicising the move in advance, the Treasury said: “This will be the first time ever that ‘road tax’ will only be spent on roads. Roads are a crucial part of transport infrastructure and it’s right that from 2020 motorists see their road tax directly paying for improvements to their roads.”But both Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace’s chief scientist Doug Parr said Mr Hammond should have reconsidered Mr Osborne’s plan.“It’s less than three weeks since we had a very severe warning from scientists on the effects of climate change. When we need to start cutting emissions, how compatible is this roads programme he’s talking about?” said Mr Parr.It’s very disappointing to see this government announce over and over again a ‘new’ roads programme“He should have considered the state of nature, of public transport, of pollution and of climate change and done a U-turn.”Friends of the Earth’s campaigns director Liz Hutchins said: “Doesn’t Philip Hammond read the news? Earlier this month UN scientists warned that we only have a dozen years to prevent catastrophic climate change.“Yet rather than investing in a low-carbon economy, the chancellor is gearing up to create more pollution that wrecks our climate and damages our health.“We could be a world leader in building a cleaner, safer future, but government climate policy seems to be stuck in reverse.”More than half of motorists plan to swap diesel for eco-friendly carsSian Berry, co-leader of the Green party, said: “’It’s very disappointing to see this government announce over and over again a ‘new’ roads programme that will just make traffic problems worse.\u0026nbsp“Building new roads just creates new traffic. Real, green investment in our future would boost walking and cycling, green energy and local public transport.”Simon Alcock, of environmental charity ClientEarth, said: “Emergency measures to protect our children from traffic pollution would cost £153m, which is a drop in the ocean compared with the numbers the government is allocating to roads.\u0026nbsp“Ministers seem unwilling to find money to protect children from traffic pollution around schools but are happy to spend billions on roads.”The Treasury said the roads fund would help “make journeys quicker and easier for millions of commuters across the country, while boosting productivity and road safety. Congestion costs UK households over £30 billion every year and the equivalent of more than 100 million working days could be lost, between now and 2040, unless action is taken.”Councils will receive £420m for potholes and repairs and to keep bridges open. A further £150m will help improve local junctions.The government’s Transforming Cities Fund will be extended by £680m to support local transport projects such as cycling networks, new buses and trams.The chancellor is also expected to announce an extra £90m to trial “next-generation” methods of transport, potentially including self-driving shuttle services and electric bikes.RAC spokesman Simon Williams told The Independent: “It’s great news for motorists. We know from research that there has been a big increase in dependency on the car so roads are important for the country.“We found 59 per cent of drivers said they would be very keen to take public transport if it was better, but it’s not as affordable, comfortable or frequent as it should be, and many people in rural areas have not choice of how to get to work.”He said motorists were suffering too much damage to their vehicles from potholes, which also posed a safety risk to others when drivers swerved to avoid the holes.A Treasury spokesman said the government was not boosting roads in isolation but was also improving air quality.He said: “We need to repair our roads and ensure the right roads are in the right places, and it’s part of our mix of strategies.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Campaigners say they are alarmed that the proposal appears to be going ahead despite the lack of a formal public consultation, environmental assessment or parliamentary enquiry.“If given the green light, this development will change the face of England’s countryside forever. Yet no formal assessment of the environmental impact it will have has taken place,” said Paul Miner, head of strategic plans and devolution at CPRE.“Despite costing at least £5.5bn in public money, there has been no formal public consultation around developing the Arc. The lack of debate equates to a major, and troubling, democratic deficit at the heart of the proposals.”Hundreds of thousands urge government to stop fast-tracking frackingGreen MEP for the South East, Keith Taylor, said the study revealed “the terrifying extent of the impact of the Oxford-Cambridge Arc”, and questioned the legality of pushing ahead without consulting with local communities.“It clearer than ever that the project is a monumental disaster and act of environmental sabotage,” he said.Responding to the claims,\u0026nbspan NIC spokesman\u0026nbspsaid: “Our recommendations come with the clear condition that new schemes should not compromise the high-quality natural environment for existing and future residents, and do not need to involve any changes to existing Green Belt protections.“In fact, our report made clear the need for significant investment in landscape improvements, affordable housing and sustainable transport. These changes are vital to make the most of the area’s economic potential and the contribution it makes to the wider UK economy.”CPRE\u0026nbsphas called for a full assessment to be conducted that looks at the impact on people’s health and wellbeing as well as environmental impacts including climate change.Instead of investing in the new expressway, the group called for investment in improved public transport in the region alongside a commitment to building “genuinely affordable homes”.The government is aiming to build 300,000 new homes need to be built each year in England to meet demand, and experts have warned of significant backlogs.Mr Brokenshire said: “The Oxford-Cambridge Arc is an opportunity to further strengthen rural economies, enhance the environment and benefit local communities.“Our new planning rulebook strengthens protections for the Green Belt and\u0026nbspwe have sets out our ambition to ensure housing projects are more environmentally friendly.”Campaign to Protect Rural EnglandShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

In those circumstances, I suggested the EU should begin preparatory work on the extension of Article 50.“Because what would not be a good thing in my view is if we managed to get a referendum but it was too late because we had left the EU or the EU had not made preparations for an Article 50 extension.”Mr Khan added: “Whatever Theresa May brings back will probably be rejected by cabinet, almost certainly rejected by the party, and if not will definitely be rejected by parliament.“That’s why I said to Michel Barnier: listen, you need to start preparing for the possibility of extending Article 50 because if that is the case we will need time to have a referendum.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

It is only right that they have a say in their nation’s future.”Mr Hutton added: “This careful analysis shows just how badly young people – already disadvantaged by the breakdown of career structures and high housing costs – will be further hit by Brexit.”And Mr\u0026nbspOluwole said: “Now that the implications for our generation have become clear, we need a People’s Vote on the government’s Brexit deal.”The research comes as the Brexit talks remain deadlocked over the issue of the Irish border backstop – with just five months until departure day next March.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Amazon shares dropped as much as 8 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported quarterly sales of $56.58bn (£44.16bn), missing expectations of $57.1bn. Alphabet’s stock fell 4.7 per cent after it posted revenue of $33.74bn, missing Wall Street’s target of $34.04bn, although earnings of $13.06 per share came in well ahead of the expected $10.42 per share. Google reveals it has sacked 48 employees over sexual harassmentGoogle leak reveals plans for censored search engine in ChinaEbay sues Amazon, accusing rival of illegally poaching sellersAmazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employees“Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing. “But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.”Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “poorly received” earnings from Alphabet and Amazon had “soured the mood on what had been a rebounding US session”. However, Christopher Rossbach, CIO of investment firm J. Stern \u0026amp Co, said the companies both remain fundamentally strong, despite missing market expectations. “While their revenues were both slightly lower than expected, with Amazon additionally guiding slightly lower than street expectations for the next quarter, they still both show good profitability,” he said. \u0026nbsp“Alphabet is the leader in search and advertising, and Amazon is the leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, and increasingly benefits from advertising too. The fundamentals of both companies are intact and we believe that any significant weakness is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.”Other tech stocks that dipped in after-hours include Apple, which fell 1.6 per cent, and Twitter, which was down 2.5 per cent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While campaigning on Tuesday, Irish prime minister\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar outlined his support for the reform.“What we want to have in Ireland is a 21st\u0026nbspCentury constitution for a 21st\u0026nbspCentury republic,” he said. “We’ve already reformed our Constitution to allow for things like marriage equality, women’s right to choose.“We believe that having a criminal offence for blasphemy in Ireland is a bit outdated so we’re asking people to change that. It’s very much part of a reform of our whole Constitution to make the country more modern.”Created with Sketch.

Surveys in recent weeks suggested he enjoyed the support of around two-thirds of the electorate.But the real surprise of this election result has been the performance of runner up Peter Casey, who took 23.1 per cent of the vote.Mr\u0026nbsp Casey is a Derry-born businessman now based in the US, who has starred as an investor on the Irish version of Dragon’s Den. He was an outsider candidate polling just 1 per cent\u0026nbspin polls published last week.However, his campaign took a turn at the weekend after he made controversial comments about the travelling community in Ireland, who he claimed were “basically people camping in someone else’s land”.While it initially appeared the comments might derail his campaign, instead it appears to have drawn a fifth of voters to his camp. In the past, Mr Casey has also criticised Ireland as a welfare state, suggested the country should abandon its historic neutrality, and has also criticised its relationship with the EU.Among the losers in this election are Sinn Fein, who were hoping that their candidate Liadh Ni Riada could provide a fresh alternative to\u0026nbspMr Higgins, but she came in third place.\u0026nbspThe party has failed to match the 13 per cent of the vote earned by Martin McGuinness at the last election, with early results indicating many of the party’s supporters voted for Mr Higgins, or Mr Casey.The result will also be disappointing for Sean Gallagher, another businessman who came second in the 2011 election, but has now seen his support base collapse. The other two candidates, Joan Freeman and Gavin Duffy, earned low results, predicted by the polls.Created with Sketch. Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Such is Mr Higgins’ popularity in Ireland – for a while it seemed he might be re-elected unopposed – as Mary McAleese was in 2004. But polls showed that while the majority of people wanted him back for a second term, most people also wanted to see a campaign.Mr Higgins stood with the support of the main Fine Gael and Fianna Fail parties, and commanded support across the political spectrum.A veteran Irish politician, Mr Higgins was a lifelong member of the Labour party. He has served as a mayor, a senator, a TD in the Irish parliament, and was minister for culture in the 1990s. During this period he helped set up the first Irish language TV station TG4, being a fluent speaker himself. He also has a background in academia and is respected as a published poet.A natural statesman, Mr Higgins has been praised for his ability to reach out across all sections of Irish society, his handling of difficult anniversaries in the past decade, and for how he represents Ireland on the world stage.He has achieved a rare feat in Ireland by becoming a somewhat beloved politician – something which is easier to carry in the largely ceremonial role of the presidency, which is above party politics.But he did come in for criticism during this campaign – particularly from Mr Casey – over the cost of the presidency, his use of expenses and how transparent this was to the taxpayer. None of this damaged Mr Higgins’ reputation personally, but it is likely he will push for some reform of the office during this second term.The Irish presidency is a largely ceremonial role, but the office holder does occupy a unique space which can both set and respond to the mood of the nation.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We do need to turn this round because the consequences of delivering Brexit will be awful. The consequences of not delivering Brexit are still significant.It\u0026rsquos a real challenge that we got. We\u0026rsquore on it but sometimes we need to do that a wee bit quieter than perhaps is usually my style.SNP has been publicly opposed to Brexit with the party threatening to vote down Theresa May\u0026rsquos final deal if it excludes a bespoke trade agreement for Scotland.\u0026nbsp14.00 update: Relatives of EU nationals should be allowed to remain in UK after brexit, say ministersA pilot of the scheme to allow EU nationals to remain in the UK after Brexit should be extended to family members, Scottish and Welsh health secretaries have saidThe EU Settlement Scheme pilot, due to begin in November, is open to health and social care workers and university staff, offering them the chance to apply for settled status before the UK leaves the EU in March.However family members are not included and will have to wait to a later date to have their status confirmed.Scotland\u0027s Health Secretary Jeane Freeman and her Welsh counterpart Vaughan Gething have urged UK Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes to reconsider, and have offered to host a pilot in Scotland and Wales in which relatives can take part.Ministers are calling for the families of EU nationals to be allowed to remain in the UK (Image: getty)Failure to do so would mean the ministers could not actively promote the pilot, they said.In a letter to Ms Nokes, the health secretaries said: We reiterate our view that the scheme as currently proposed is much more likely to deter, rather than to encourage, our EU staff from taking this opportunity to clarify their immigration status ahead of the UK leaving the EU on March 29 2019.We ask that you reconsider your decision not to include family members in the scheme.If you are amenable, and if your concerns are mainly about making the pilot cohort too large to manage, then we would be content to pilot the inclusion of family members in Scotland and Wales.If you are not able to agree to this, we would not feel comfortable actively promoting the scheme to health and social care staff in Wales and Scotland, although it is not our intention to oppose, or in any way to obstruct, the smooth operation of the scheme across the UK.A Home Office spokesman said: The EU Settlement Scheme will make it easy for EU citizens to get the status they need. In late August, we invited a small number of EU citizens to apply as part of the first testing phase to prove some of the functionality and processes.In order to ensure that the numbers of those involved in the testing remain controlled, family members of those applying during the private beta are not able to apply - unless they are themselves eligible through their employment with, or support from, the participating organisations.Family members of those granted status under the private beta can apply when the scheme is rolled out more widely.

Why do they not get paid what they are worth to their company, and why are so many overlooked for promotion The sad fact is that for every £ men earn, women make just  pence.Just over one in ten women negotiated their starting salary, while more than half of all men haggle with their boss before they have even started work.When women do ask for more pay, they are  per cent less likely to get a raise. Andthey do receive a wage increase it will be  per cent less than men get.Sadly, it is common in business that women are often viewed as weak or unable to cope. And once we think about or start a family, we become toxic to employers.I receive hundreds of direct messages on social media from women asking: “How do I get a pay rise  How do I get noticed at work  How can I get promoted  How can I get on after maternity leave ”So now I am launching Get What You Want, a series of online masterclasses and podcasts covering everything from getting promoted to dealing with the word no, overcoming challenges, negotiating pay, writing a fantastic CV and nailing an interview.It will also cover baby-proofing careers, as well as becoming a super-mum after maternity leave.A lot of women have skills but just lack confidence. As women, we don’t shout about our wins enough for fear we will appear arrogant, even though men talk about them all the time.Here are some of my tips to winning at work.When people say: “I hate my job” I always ask: “Why are you telling me  I can’t do anything about it.”YOU have to do something. Sit down and work out what it is you don’t like about the position and set yourself a task of getting a new one.Be very dedicated and very professional and excel when you get to the interview.Many people don’t realise that when you are invited for an interview it is because they believe you can do the job.The secret is convincing them that you can do the job better than anyone .You should be able to talk about your specialist subject, which is yourself.People find it very dficult to list all the things they have done really well in a professional way to show good examples of why they can do the job.Opening a negotiation is all about knowing your worth.And knowing your value is really about your self-worth. They are totally linked.Write down all the things where you have made a big ­contribution, all the things that you have changed and made a dference, how you have added value. Put together testimonials to really back up what you have done.Then work out what more you want to do, because going above and beyond your job description is very important.Take out all the emotion, go in and lay out for your boss the facts of what you’ve contributed to the organisation.Sometimes people can be very passive. They say: “I’ll go along with what everyone  agrees with.”They want to avoid conflict. They don’t really think their opinion is as important as other people’s, so they are simply giving others a licence to ignore them.Learn to say no. Say: “I don’t really have the time butI can make the time I can do it for you.” Otherwise you become like a human sponge. Don’t let them take advantage.Employers take advantage of women’s lack of confidence, especially a mother ing from maternity leave. Many feel so grateful to have a job that they tend to put up with almost anything.Eleven per cent of new mothers report that they have been dismissed or made redundant where others in their workplace were not, or were treated so poorly they felt they had to leave.That means as many as , women are losing their jobs each year.Have a really clear plan of how you will manage at home and manage work.

Ms Knightley, who adds, “Rescue yourself,” clearly feels she is protecting daughter Edie by banning something that doesn’t concur with her own off-the-shelf, Poundland version of what feminism should be.But what she’s in danger of doing is wilfully nurturing a potential “snowflake” who, rather than develop the critical thinking skills that allow healthy debate, will simply stick their fingers in their ears and cry foul when they see or hear something that dfers from their own world view.Keira, tonight’s homework is to really readCinderella and analyse it.Look past the Disney-esque cute rodents, pretty frocks and glass slippers and instead dig a little deeper to ­appreciate the original’s narrative of how hope can turn unjust oppression into ­triumphant reward.Cinderella is a young woman who has not only suffered the loss of her loving father, but now faces a letime of abuse from an uncaring stepmother and her equally unpleasant daughters.But instead of sitting in the ashes ­waiting unquestioningly for whatever fate might have in store for her, she remains resolutely ­optimistic and decides to secretly defy her nemesis by gatecrashing a hot-ticket party to which she hasn’t been invited.Now that’s girl power.Ultimately, she “‘rescues” herself by proactively going to the ball where, instead of abuse, she experiences the redemptive qualities of love and kindness.They just happen to come in the form of a handsome prince.In the same week, Kristen Bell — who coincidentally voices Anna in the Disney film Frozen — found herself caught up in the slipstream of Keira’s PC virtue signalling after reportedly saying that Snow White gives young girls the wrong ­message about consent “because you cannot kiss someonethey’re sleeping”.Except Kristen’s comment was taken out of context and she’s got the balance right.Because what she actually said was that she reads the story with her two ­daughters, aged five and three, then asks them: “Don’t you think it’s weird that Snow White didn’t ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple ” before starting up a conversation about the dos and don’ts of taking food from strangers.Or, “Don’t you think that it’s weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission ” to float an almost subliminal, age-appropriate understanding of what does and doesn’t constitute ­consent.Kristen isn’t banning tales of old, she’s using them to stimulate discussions.In other words, teaching her children the vital le skills of critical thinking — dictionary definition: “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment” — and being able to rationally debate that judgment with someone whose view might dfer from your own.Attempting to sanitise a child’s world by airbrushing history will hinder, not help them.Instead, wield history’s lessons as a tool to educate.Cinderella was of its time and now the Disney pendulum has seemingly swung the other way to depict a world where all the central characters are feisty, opinionated young women who power-kick their way through le.But how will Keira’s daughter know how far the depiction of Disney ­princesses has comeshe’s not allowed to see where they’ve been ONE morning last week, I spent a glorious couple of hours walking around Westminster Abbey.Buried or commemorated there are, among others, more than , great Britonsincluding Sir Isaac Newton, Jane Austen, Noel Coward, Charles Darwin, the Bronte sisters, Clement Attlee, Charles Dickens, David Livingstone, Stephen Hawking and, of course, the grave of the unknown warrior, buried on November ,  “in honour of the many multitudes who during the Great War of - gave the most that man can give . . . le itself.”My mother works at the Abbey as a “blue-gowner” – the volunteer guides there to answer any questions not covered by the electronic headsets – and, while showing us the ft by ft grave of poet Ben Jonson, who is the only person there to be buried upright, she was approached by a couple of earnest-looking women in their early twenties.Amid such a rich seam of history, rigorous intellect and achievement, what did they ask “Excuse me, where did David Beckham sit for the royal wedding ”THE number of stay-at-home dads has dropped to the lowest level in five years.Experts reckon it could be due to men “growing tired” of the tough job of raising kids.Proof,needed, might be the glassy-eyed expression of Bond actor Daniel Craig,  just six weeks after we Rachel Weisz gave birth to their daughter.He never looks this knackered when he’s jumping off buildings and dodging bullets.Stay-at-home parenthood can be isolating, sometimes dull, frequently thankless and relentlessly bloody exhausting. Only the strong survive it.THANKS to Ryanair’s ­astonishing failure to act when a passenger racially abused Windrush immigrant Delsie Gayle on one of its flights, the man will likely escape prosecution because of jurisdictional issues once a plane takes off from one country’s airspace to another.Instead, he is likely only to be banned from ever travelling on Ryanair again.Which, as plenty of the budget airline’s past ­customers might tell you, could equally be regarded as a blessing rather than a punishment.COMEDIAN Seann Walsh and his Strictly partner Katya Jones have survived the dreaded dance-off to, presumably, jive another day.Because, let’s face it, since that snog, the Strictly bosses are ­rapidly running out of drearily chaste dances to give them.Last weekend it was the unsexy Charleston, ­performed in equally unsexy “Where’s Wally” outfits that virtually screamed “nothing to see here”. Then this weekend it was a faintly ­ludicrous, undeniably platonic quickstep that saw them trotting around the floor like a couple of hyperactive show ponies.Assuming the sizzling Argentine tango is, er, strictly no-go, whatever next  A jive in burkas  A Viennese waltz in sackcloths Not least from Tom himself, perhaps, whose first we Mimi Rogers bemoaned the lack of intimacy in their union because, she claims, he wanted to be a monk and “thought he had to be celibate to maintain the purity of his instrument, but my instrument needed tuning, and we had to split.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The African plate is subdacting, going under, and the European plate we say itsabout cm a year.So all this middle and southern Mediterranean is a very active zone, so it has produced many earthquakes in historical times and in the present.We have stories collected from historical times from a large earthquake magnitude . offshore near Crete in AD which produced a tsunami and reached even Egypt.We have another in AD near Sicily, which devastated some cities in Sicily and caused a tsunami.Large scale earthquakes will continue to go ahead in Italy and Greece. But not only big earthquakes are associated with big risk.She cited last years . magnitude earthquake which struck central Italy as one example of a moderate tremor that can cause carnage.This hit on January  a few kilometres northwest of the town of LAquila, killing  people and laying waste to several ancient towns.She added: Risk comes even from moderate earthquakes, they tend to happen every five years in these countries. They are more frequent than large ones.Last year scientists said they expected an increase in earthquakes due to a tiny decrease in the speed of the planets rotation.A report presented at the Geological Society of America argued that five periods of intense seismic activity throughout history have followed periods of when the Earths rotation slowed.However, Segou did not believe the frequency of the tremors hitting Europe was increasing.Associate Professor of Earthquake Science in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne, Mark Quigley has previously told news.au central Italy is experiencing crustal extension.He says: Eastern central Italy is moving to the NE relative to Rome.As a result, this region experiences normal faulting earthquakes as the land is torn apart. The fault systems are short and structurally complex, so the earthquakes are not overly large by global standards.But because the earthquakes are shallow and structurally complex, and because many of the local towns and cities contain vulnerable buildings, strong shaking from these earthquakes has the potential to inflict major damage and loss of le in urban areas.Some  per cent occur around the rim of the Pacic Ocean.The plates - giant rock slabs that make up the Earths upper layer - are always slowly moving.They often collide and slide against each other, according to National Geographic.This impact can be unnoticeable on the surface but can cause immense stress between the plates.When this stress is released, it causes massive vibrations, called seismic waves, often hundreds of miles through the rock to the surface.There are fears that there is a big one on the way after a flurry of volcanic activity in the Pacics Ring of Fire.A study from Calornia says that the cluster of tremors around the planets so-called Ring of Fire- a horseshoe-shaped geological disaster zone - could indicate the big one is due to hit.The research, published in the journal Science Advances, involved analysis of  major earthquakes around the Pacic Ring of Fire between  and .Europe also has a number of volcanoes - some dormant, others active - which have in the past caused catastrophic events and huge loss of le.Among these is Mount Etna, on Sicily, which was first recorded erupting in BC, and has exploded around  times since.This last occurred in  when a BBC crew were pelted with boiling rocks and steam as they filmed the mountainside.Many in Europe also remember the  eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull, in Iceland, which triggered huge air travel disruptions across western and northern Europe.Last year, researchers at the University of Leeds revealed the findings of a study which determined such ash cloud eruptions could occur once every  years.Co-author Dr Graeme Swindles said: In , when Eyjafjallajökull erupted, people were really shocked – it seemed to come completely out of the blue, but the eruption of Grímsvötn, the following year, was an extraordinary coincidence.Although it is possible that ash clouds can occur on an annual basis, the averageinterval for the last , years is around  years.The last time volcanic ash clouds affected northern Europe before the recent event was in ,  years ago – but aviation was much less intense at that time and it simply didnt have the same sort of impact.Our research shows that, over thousands of years, these sorts of incidents are not that rare – but people wondering how likely it is that the  chaos will be repeated in the next few years can feel somewhat reassured.Just this year alone the world has witnessed destructive eruptions in Hawaii, Bali and Guatemala.However, Clive Oppenheimer, professor of volcanology at the University of Cambridge, says there has not been an increase in volcanic activity.He told The : There have been quite a few eruptions in the news lately, so people question whether there’s an increase in rates of volcanism that we’re seeing just now, and this isn’t really the case.Eruptions are happening all the time - some make the news headlines and others don’t.If we look at the statistics back in time, the main thing we see is a reporting bias. There are not many eruptions during World War Two, for example, when people had other things to really worry about.So of course things will flare up in one place or another place and then it will be very much how those eruptions affect people and whereabouts in the world - whether that then becomes newsworthy."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000424503091.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sewage drinking water thames bosses","story":"Thames Water said today the UKs capital will lose £ million a daydramatic measures arent put in place to save the citys water supply.The population of London is set to rise by two million people in the next  years which could lead to a million litre daily shortfall of water, made worse by climate change reducing natural resources.So Thames Water plans to open a reuse plant at the Deephams Sewage Treatment Works in North East London which will turn sewage into water clean enough to drink - a UK first, the Evening Standard reports.But the plant is not currently planned for everyday use - its intended for times of projected or actual drought.Discussions with the Environment Agency are ongoing about the viability of this plan.After plans to build a new £.billion reservoir in Oxfordshire were rejected by the government in , the plan is being revived by Thames Water.It is intended for water to be shipped down the Thames along the Oxford Canal to ensure taps keep flowing.The reservoir near Abingdon would play a vital role in supplying water to the South East.It will be complete by ,the government approves it.Thames Water also owns the UKs only desalination plant in Beckton, East London, which turns sea water into million litres of drinking water a day during drought.The company has a water resources management plan for the next  years which has budgeted £.billion until .A spokesperson said Thames Water is pledging to reduce leakage from its ,-mile network of pipes.He added: “More needs to be done to protect Londoners from the risk of severe drought.“Restrictions on water use in London alone could cost more than £million a day.”The reuse plant will put million litres of water a day back into the system by passing treated sewage through a desalination membrane to clean it.Its then mixed with reservoir water, treated again and pumped into the network.The spokesperson added: “We wouldn’t consider reusewe didn’t think the water would be good enough.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CM-IMAGE-POO-MUZZ1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=710\" height=\"1298\" width=\"960","title":"mcdonalds human poo london newham","story":"Disgusted Ben Terry posted a picture of the human poo on the chains Facebook page.The image shows what appears to be a small piece of excrement lying on the toilet floor at the outlet in Forest Gate, Newham.Wet tissues are scattered beside it on the floor, which appears to be wet.Ben wrote: Actual human poo on the floor in Forest Gate McDonalds.

It shows the strength and resilience of the UK economy alongside the efforts and hard work of families and households up and down the country.In conventional times voters might rightly expect the result of this to be lower taxes , more investment in our public services or to see progress in us paying off the ever ballooning national debt.Instead the Government is preparing to blow this cash - your money - by giving into even more of the EU’s demands.Until last week, Britain expected a  month “transition” or “implementation” period after we formally leave the EU next year on March , .Then, late last week the Government shocked everyone by proposing that we stay in the EU longer than we were originally told and that we extend the so called ‘negotiating period’ to leave the EU.Worse still, on Monday in the House of Commons, we were told that this transition period might last until June  – that’s six years after the referendum result. Whatever happened to Brexit means Brexit On top of our extended membership of the EU, we can expect a bill from the EU! That’s right more of your money with an extra price tag of approximately £ billion each year in contributions to the EU.The Treasury has budgeted for this until the end of  but for each year after , the cost will be as high as £ billion because we will have lost the £. billion a year rebate which was famously secured and successfully negotiated in  by Margaret Thatcher when she demanded our money back from the EU.The British people are once again being treated like fools. What we are now witnessing is a blatant attempt to keep Britain in the EU while Brussels continues to raid the pockets of British taxpayers.This must end and the Government should invoke the great Thatcherite spirit of Fontainebleau and say No, No, No to Brussels. Because pumping our money into an undemocratic and unaccountable system two years after Britain voted to leave the EU is simply not right or acceptable. It makes a mockery of our democracy and is an insult to the British public.It is our money and that money should be handed back to the people and communities across the UK to invest in our domestic priorities.It could help people across Britain– especially the least well off – by giving them back more of the money that they earn by cutting their taxes.For example,we cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny, that would cost us £ billion.By increasing the personal allowance by a £,, many more of the poorest paid households would be taken out of tax altogether, that’d cost us £. billion. Andwe cut beer and cider duty by  pence, that would cost us £. billion.So by easing the tax burden for the lowest paid and doing our bit to save British pubs from closing, we’d have invested £ billion into longer term economic growth in our economy.And with the other £ billion  How about supporting the millions of families who want to own their own home by cutting stamp duty for homeowners, we can again help the least well off and give them a hand up and support them in their aspirations to own their home.We could also take more first time buyers out of paying stamp duty altogether  If we raised the starting threshold of £, to £,, this would cost the Treasury £. billion.Then there’s the VAT we pay on domestic gas and electricity. The  per cent VAT charge on domestic fuel and power raised around £. billion in  . If we got rid of this we would make fuel cheaper and families would have a little extra left over in their monthly pay packets.What about the VAT charged on sanitary products for women  This should end now and not when we leave the EU s the Government previously promised, especially as leaving the EU will take longer than we were previously promised. VAT receipts from the sale of sanitary products costs approximately £. billion a year but importantly this one VAT cut that would unite women across the country.I could go on. There are so many important domestic key services and priorities to invest in.To govern is to choose and the choice being made our Government is to spend your money on an expensive and everlasting EU membership.And all this comes on top of the ridiculous capitulation where we have agreed to the EU’s demands to hand over a £ billion pay cheque for absolutely nothing in .Britain needs once again to have a long term economic plan that puts our national interest first.Let’s start standing up for Britain by investing in people, businesses and communities rather than the unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats of the European Union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The couple, from Hull, booked him to tile their bathroom but he left the job unfinished and the property in a complete mess, with rubbish piled in every room. But they say the man still wants to be paid in full - and has taken their house keys for ransom until they do so. The houseowner and mum-of-one, aged , who asked not to be named, booked the tradesman online. We asked around for recommendations but nobody knew of anyone who could do the work, she told Hull Live .  We found a guy that said he could do the work at a decent price, so we agreed to take him on. The first night on the Monday we checked into the house to see how he was getting on, as we arent living in it at the moment until it is all done up, and it all looked fine. We didnt have time to call in on Tuesday, but on the Wednesday when the work was meant to be finished, we walked in to an absolute bomb site. She says the tiler left a mess in nearly every room of the house, and thinks what he has done in the home is completely disrespectful. Grout was all up the walls, the tiles were wonky, the mosaic doesnt go all the way up the ceiling and the floor tiles are ruined, she said. Were also going to need a new bath as he let grout fall in there and took the protective peel off it, and now all the grout has hardened and scratched it. He trashed the bedroom that will be my sons by leaving all the rubbish in there and he left the kitchen in a state with grout splattered all up the walls where he mixed it for the tiles - why he didnt go outside to mix it I just cant understand. He also left mucky hand prints on the fridge and had unplugged it after helping himself to all our drinks. The carpets in the rooms were also left a mess where he had walked about and left tile cuttings.  The tiler still quoted pound for the work, but the homeowners say they are not paying it and estimate it may now cost another pound to put right his work and replace items he ruined. We offered him pound for the work so that he would give us his house keys back, which we though was a fair contribution, but hes demanded more money off us and has said the bathroom has been left like it is because the walls are poor. His we has called us screaming down the phone to demand money from us, and hes emotionally blackmailed us by saying his daughter is giving him money from her piggy bank as we arent paying him. We just cant afford it, though, when we are going to have to pay out so much to fix what hes done. The couple say the situation has taken its toll and they are now worried about employing another tiler. My partner is absolutely livid about it all and Im really annoyed, she said.

Steve Turley was served an enforcement notice by the Forest of Dean District Council last year which demanded he bulldoze his makesht house, extended outbuildings and a static caravan. Mr Turley appealed the ruling, but a planning inspector has now backed the council. He began construction of the property in near Lydney, Gloucestershire, after he sold his six-bedroom house for pound, three years ago, reports Gloucestershire Live. The house was put on the market with no onward chain and sold, without the land which is on the opposite side of the road.  A complaint was made to the council which informed them that members of his family were living on the land in an unauthorised bedroom bungalow and caravan hidden behind high walls and hedges. Mr Turley argued it was permitted development but the council officials said the location was unsustainable. A council spokesperson said: Mr Steve Turley constructed a dwelling on the site and extended outbuildings without planning permission.  Forest of Dean District Council served an enforcement notice in December , instructing him to restore the site to its original condition before the planning breach took place, cease the use of the land for residential purposes, remove the static caravan, portable building and demolish the dwelling and concrete hard standings at the site. Mr Turley appealed the notice. While the inspector acknowledged that the instruction to remove the hard standings was excessive, he upheld the Councils other requests for demolition. Philip Burford, the chairman of the planning committee, said: This decision serves as a warning to anyone who decides to ignore the planning process and the message is clear: dont spend a considerable amount of money and time on a building project in the knowledge that it does not have planning permission.

The video was captured by landscape astro-photographer Nick Jackson who had gone to the castle to shoot the th century building in front of the night sky.

It was a sheer stroke of luck that I just happened to be shooting the series of images when it happened.  With things like that, youve got to be in the right place at the right time.

He said: The hole was full of earth, but with the help of a neighbour, we have managed to get about ft deep. I always wanted to dig it out to seeI could find a pot of gold at the bottom, so when I retired thats what I did. I was quite surprised really, I would have preferred it to be in the garden where I could have got at it a little easier. Using a ladder and a bucket on a pulley system, it took them around six months to get to the depth it is at now.  Colin said: We think its a bottle well. Its  inches wide now and could go down another -ft. I thought Id found a sword around ft down - it was a wooden thing that must have had a leather sheath on it as you can see stitch holes. Thats why I want to get to the bottom. Who knows whats down there. We have no idea when it was built. There could have been a couple of cottages here or it could have served a farm. Id like to find something down the bottom, something to give me an age. I wish I had a Tardis to go back in time and see what was here.

Training has been really good and I thinkyou asked any of the boys in the changing-room we’d all be the same.“It’s really gone up a level, we’re all enjoying it and I think that shows on a Saturday.“It’s been quite tough but I think we needed that. It’s been enjoyable at the same time, though, and we’re all buying into his ideas.”Off the field there seems to be an air of optimism around Tannadice but Booth knows getting results on the pitch is the only way to realise their hopes of promotion.And that means keeping their unbeaten run under the new boss going against a Dunfermline side that have already bagged a deserved win over the Tangerines.Booth added: “Four points from the first two games isn’t too bad but I think they were two good performances as well.“We feel hard done by we didn’t get the win over Inverness – I think most people there would agree with that but it wasn’t to be.“At least we put in a really positive performance and everyone is pulling in the same direction.“There is a good feel about the place and, hopefully, we can kick on now and go on a little run.“The players, coaching staff, fans all seem to be pulling in the same direction especially since the new gaffer has come in.“A thousand fans down at Partick, great backing and then same again last weekend.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op. And the busy dad-of-three apparently had no idea that the arrival of the President of the United States was imminent. By the time he’d come out of the shop with his shopping, police were taking no chances and had removed his car from Maybole High Street. And Peter Goudie, , came face to face with officers, including armed police, who were twitchy that his Volkswagen Golf was in the way.  Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car. He added: “His we was furious when she found out as it cost pound to get the car back the following day. “He was in the dog house for his stupidity.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEd SheeranVolkswagenJusticePrestwickDonald TrumpAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire vets reveal cases sedated","story":"NewsAyrshire vets reveal cases of \"sedated\" and \"drowsy\" dogs on our beachesWidespread reports of dogs falling ill have sparked panic among pet owners in the region.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsAyr beach \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVets have been inundated with sick dogs on Ayrshires coastline, the Post can reveal.

McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.

Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance.

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers learn lifesaving first aid","story":"CDJFA groups have been learning basic first aid skills, from paramedic Lorne McArthur, which could help treat sports injuries.The youngster#s training included cleaning and bandaging up wounds, supporting broken bones, dealing with concussion and some CPR and  children in total took advantage of this opportunity.Imogen Todd practices resuscitation watched by other young players.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

The use of recycling boxes rather than bins and the introduction of food waste caddies has helped the county produce high-quality waste with fewer contaminants, meaning less has to be sent for treatment.Now Mr Reid wants to bring a similar approach to travel in the county as East Lothian prepares for an influx of new residents due to a plethora of new housing developments.And he revealed talks were under way to try and replace the councilrsquos refuse collection vehicles with electric versions as it looks to lead by example.He said: ldquoThe public bought into recycling because we gave them options such as the food waste bins and also because they knew it was the right thing to do.ldquoActive travel will be an evolution but we need to give people access to it. We need to provide cycle paths and safe walkways we need train services to be on time. If we can develop plans to provide these services then people will automatically select not to take the car, just as they will select electric vehicles as they become cheaper too.ldquoIt is about getting the message out and empowering people to be able to do it.The introduction of electric bin lorries would be a huge step towards improving the environment and changing public perception.Some such lorries are being trialled in England by waste recycling firms, with one company in Sheffield introducing two vehicles which are powered by burning non-recyclable rubbish as they collect it. Others are being tested using rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe are actively working with partners to deliver one of the first fully electric refuse collection vehicles that would be powered through renewable energy currently generated on site at Kinwegar [recycling centre near Wallyford]."},{"url":null,"title":"update-dog-that-bit-off-mans-genitals-put-down","story":"The -year-old man was taken to hospital in Edinburgh following the attack on Sunday, October .The Courier

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did.

Several explanations exist -one being that there are mink trails below that attract the dogs- but many locals believe there is a supernatural cause of the curious phenomenon. In Celtic beliefs the bridge is known as a lsquothin placersquo where the realms of the living cross with the dead, with the dogs apparently super-sensitive to the spirits and compelled to leap into the water to escape them.

Mrs Barbourrsquos army went toe-to-toe with bailfrsquos officers trying to evict their neighbours and finally marched on the sherf court to support tenants being prosecuted for non-payment of the rent increases.David Lloyd George was forced to intervene as Munitions Minister and the Rent Restrictions Act was passed within a month, a piece of legislation that inspired similar movements across the world. If some of the unelected executives in Glasgow City currently pulling down six-figure salaries had had their way Mary Barbour and her women would probably still be fighting this battle.On Tuesday and Wednesday , women staged a strike and marched for the equal wages and the payment of a decade of back money to which their entitlement is now enshrined in law. A few streets away stuntmen in black sports cars and motorcycles were filming the latest in the Fast and Furious movie franchise, Hobbs and Shaw. In Glasgowrsquos city chambers the response by officials both elected and unelected could be described as aw and naw.The leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken, tried to pat the women on the head while suggesting that they didnrsquot really know why they were striking. To be fair to Ms Aitken, she inherited this situation following a decade when the ruling Labour administration spent pound.m fighting the claims of more than , mainly female public sector workers to have pay parity with their male colleagues. Such wretched conduct was characteristic of Labour in Scotland as it gradually lost the hearts and minds of its core support. Ms Aitken made the task of ending this dispute a primary manesto commitment in  and few doubt her desire or sincerity. Yet, at times during this dispute it seems that she, an elected official, is being undermined by those who have been wielding real power in Glasgowrsquos city chambers for far too long.Certainly, there can be no doubt that the issues genesis and its consequences lie at the door of successive Labour administrations and this rendered the messages of support from Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard hollow. A wiser course for Mr Leonard and the Pavlov Dogs in his party to have adopted would have been simply to have acknowledged Labourrsquos faults and pledged to support all sides in reaching a just settlement.Yet, the SNP must also watch its step. It has spent  years at the task of taking Glasgow from Labour and has been able to occupy most of the moral high ground in this dispute. Some of the partyrsquos rhetoric and tactics in the course of these febrile last few weeks, though, has been questionable. Whoever spun the line that the proposed two-day strike would put the health and lives of vulnerable people at risk obviously knows little about the issues at the heart of the dispute. Council executives were also given three weeksrsquo notice to make alternative arrangements.These are troubles those who inhabit George Squarersquos executive suite will never encounter. Their remuneration packages along with all others at the council who earn more than poundk rose from  earning collectively pound,, in   to  who got pound,, in  , according to the Investigative Journalism Unit, The Ferret.Ms OrsquoDonnell herself earned pound, in  , an increase of more than poundk in one year. When this dispute has been settled, Ms Aitkenrsquos next task must be to hold these unelected executives to account. Their high-handed and arrogant attitude has probably cost the city tens of millions and led to increased hardship for thousands of claimants and their families. The elected leader of Glasgow City Council needs to show these people that she is the real boss.She could start by asking why her chief executive missed  previous meetings to negotiate with trade unions before finally getting involved by threatening to deploy Thatcherite anti-trade union laws. The threatening letter about secondary strike action sent to the unions sent by Carole Forrest, the councilrsquos director of governance on Tuesday night was a serious error of judgment. It risked escalating the dispute at a time when both sides were already beginning to release some air from the situation. It also betrayed ignorance of how trade unionism has shaped this cityrsquos industrial history. Few Glasgow citizens have been left untouched by the kindness and hard work of these women over many decades. Many of us will eventually come to rely on their gentleness when it is our time for the soup and tartan blankets. We also have a near-sacred tradition of not crossing picket lines in a just dispute.Scotlandrsquos First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted her support of the Glasgow women but said the withdrawal of their labour was unnecessary. She was wrong, for this was a most necessary strike and a reminder that such actions still have a place in an industrial landscape that remains grossly

seeking to contact teachers directly to inform them of the detail of the deal Mr Swinney clearly believes classroom staff will see the offer as beneficial, regardless of what their unions are telling

Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Sunday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amSee this week#s edition of The Orcadian for over thirty job listings.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority. We will continue to work closely with Scottish Government, other agencies and industry at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years. Mr Robertson said: \"We were particularly glad to have a representative of the Inkson family with us, in the form of J.K.rsquos daughter, Helen, and we were pleased to hear a message of greeting from his son, Kerr, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\"Kerr wrote of his pride in the job his father had done, developing and managing the exchanges. He also wished us all a happy evening together. We remembered with fondness, all those who were no longer with us, and especially J.K.Inkson himself, to whose memory all drank a fitting toast.\"Warm thanks were also expressed to Sandra Collard who helped maintain contacts and organise the event and Marie-Anny who \"emulated mdash and surpassed mdash her fictional compatriot, Monsieur Poirot, in locating so many of our Belgian friends\".Although Marie-Anny was the only surviving Belgian veteran who felt able to undertake the long journey to Ross-shire, Mr Robertson said: \"There has been a great exchange of email addresses, and it looks like the ether will be buzzing with electronic correspondence between old friends in Britain and Belgium.\"Well done, Marie-Anny and Sandra, for giving us one of the most memorable days of our lives, and thank you Alistair, for your magical photographic memories of this wonderful occasion!\"Sunday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Sunday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

This, after all, is the man who took hundreds of millions from BHS, before selling it to a serial bankrupt for a pound and leaving it with a £ million hole in its pension fund. As the company collapsed and , people lost their jobs, the chairman of Arcadia Group – which includes Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge and Topshop – was splashing his cash on luxury holidays or on his m yacht, Lionheart. This is the man who put his company in the name of his we, Tina, who lives in Monaco, in order to cut his tax bill.In Oliver Shah’s unauthorised biography, Damaged Goods – much of which Green disputes – the -year-old billionaire is presented as an intolerant bully prone to expletive-filled temper tantrums. His lavish parties – at which champagne flows and superstars perform – have seen him compared to Jay Gatsby. But it is impossible to imagine that suave,amoral, bootlegger yelling: “You’re absolutely f*****g useless. I should throw you out of the window, but you’re so fat you’d probably bounce back in again!” as Shah claims Green once yelled at one of his employees.In one interview from , Green was described as “the archetypal Alpha male [who] calls me ‘hon’”. Of the #MeToo campaign, he is alleged to have asked: “Where’s this all going to end  There’s no stag parties, no hen parties, no more girls parading in the ring at the boxing.” Yet, when thethreatened to run a story suggesting Green had used Non Disclosure Agreementsto conceal sexual harassment, bullying and racist abuse – accusations he denies – he spent £,to secure an injunction.Why would he bother when he is already so poorly regarded and when, famously, injunctions tend to attract – rather than deflect – publicity  The answer might lie with Harvey Weinstein. The film producer, whose serial sexual assaults were the catalyst for #MeToo, used NDAs to silence some of his victims. The ’s story was already being billed as the UK’s next big #MeToo scandal. Such a scandal might well have lost Green his remaining friends. And he still has his knighthood to protect. When MPs threatened to strip him of it in the wake of the collapse of BHS, he paid £m back into the pension fund so it clearly means a lot to him.In the end, however, the half a million he threw at stymieing thewas wasted . The Court of Appeal granted an interim injunction pending a trial. But on Thursday afternoon, Labour peer Peter Hain used his parliamentary privilege to identy Green as the man at the centre of the story.Lord Hain’s actions were motivated by a belief that Green was abusing his power and that the allegations ought to be in the public domain. But he appears to have ridden roughshod over a legal process which was still on-going and which would have explored the public interest argument. Eyebrows were further raised when it emerged Hain was an adviser to the legal firm Gordon Dadds which represented the.This is far from the only legal and or ethical conundrum raised by the events of the past few days. The ’s investigation has also renewed the debate on the use of NDAs. And it has intensied the debate over injunctions. Why should the super-wealthy be able to avoid scrutiny  And are injunctions even practical in an age of global communication In the story theran before Green’s identity had been revealed, it claimed NDAs – or gagging clauses – had been weaponised and were being used to cover up wrongdoing. In February, Zelda Perkins, a former assistant to Weinstein, broke the terms of an NDA she had signed to tell how –  years previously – the film producer had exposed himself to her and askedhe could watch her bathe.The issue hit the headlines again earlier this month after a woman who claims she was raped by footballer Cristiano Ronaldo said she had been pressured into signing an NDA worth ,. Criminal charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. Lawyers for Ronaldo later admitted the existence of the NDA, but denied the rape allegation. The police in Las Vegas – where the alleged assault took place – have now reopened their investigation.Yesterday, Emma Ritch, executive director of feminist organisation Engender, said there were two types of NDAs: those tucked into contracts in advance of employment and those used in the settlement of a sexual harassment case. “The ones tucked into contracts are pre-emptive NDAs about anything that happens in your workplace and those have a real squelching effect on all sorts of disclosures, including sexual harassment,” she says. “That’s why the Equality and Human Rights Commission [EHRC] recommendations on sexual harassment produced in December said: ‘scrap those – just get rid of them’, which I would agree with.“The ones which come at the end of a negotiated process and settlement are also used to squelch disclosures. They can’t be used to stop someone reporting a crime, but it is questionable the extent to which workers understand that. They may not be able to properly assess whether or not their employer is going to come after them and that does create a chilling effect, particularly in the more serious instances.”Jillian Merchant, employment lawyer with Thompsons, claims almost all settlements in sexual harassment cases involve a confidentiality clause. “They are very widespread,” she says. “The vast majority of the women in these situations sign these agreements because they want to forget all about what happened and they don’t want it all over the media, or because the employer offers them more money than they would get at a tribunal. “Some women want their day in court, but others would rather not. It’s easy for employers who have got the money so they can just say: ‘We will buy this off.’”Merchant believes the answer is to ban NDAs in sexual harassment cases because, as things stand, the scale of the problem is being masked. “The fact employers can settle and keep it quiet gives them more power and stops them having to take any action against the alleged perpetrator. It also allows repeat offending to happen without any consequences.”One negative consequence of outlawing NDAs, however, is that more women would have to fight their employers through tribunals, which would be traumatic for them.Media lawyer David McKie of Levy and McRae believes an outright ban on NDAs in sexual harassment cases would make it more dficult to tailor settlements to a erse range of situations.“Every single case is dferent, often involving twonot more iniduals who each have feelings and sensibilities, who are at dferent stages in their lives, who may think ‘Yes, I would like this to be kept confidential’ and then five years later might feel dferently,” he says.“It is absolutely not that I want to stop people from complaining to the police. But I think creating a hard and fast rule which prevents two people from contracting is a bad idea. It removes versatility and flexibility and I think both those features are important in law and in le.”At the Appeal Court, theargued that it had not signed any NDA and that there was a strong public interest in the information being published.But the judges who granted the interim injunction said the High Court judge had failed to take into account the legitimate role NDAs played in the consensual settlement of disputes. Though there seems to have been an assumption that thestory was being propelled by the complainants, the ruling also pointed out that two of the five women who had signed the NDAs wanted them adhered to.Still, doesn’t thehave a valid point  If a businessman has used NDAs on multiple occasions to settle sexual harassment cases, isn’t it important that potential future employees should be aware of this “I can absolutely see that argument,” says McKie. “It’s a perfectly legitimate argument and no doubt forcefully made by the . There are arguments to be made too about disclosure and the importance of freedom of expression. “But a court has to make dficult decisions balancing competing interests. The judges made reference to the rights of claimants – some of whom may not want the details in the public domain. What could happenthe details surrounding some of the claimants are publicised is that other employees might start saying: ‘Oh, I see that happened in head office: were you one of the women affected, Doris ’ Doris may not have wanted those details to come out, but now she has been effectively identied.“The other thing is,they have signed confidentiality agreements knowingly, with the benefit of legal advice and have accepted the money, part of that money is for agreeing not to speak, which I understand many people feel is morally wrong. However, it is the reality of many settlements in most forms of legal disputes. “They may have thought: ‘Would I rather have £, in my account but live with the fact I have to remain silent ’ We can all be idealistic, but everyone has to live, and the counter-argument is that they could have refused to agree to confidentiality and either renegotiate, or,appropriate, sue. But suing involves publicity and that is why confidentiality is often attractive both to the victim and the offending or paying employer. It may have been an active decision taken with professional advice. Signing that contract has consequences – so on balance I can see precisely why the appeal court reached the conclusion it did.”Injunctions are also regarded by many as an abuse of power and wealth. Green is the latest in a succession of celebrities who have large sums of money to stop allegations of their nefarious behaviour hitting the front pages. Most notorious perhaps is the case of Ryan Giggs. In , Giggs won a superinjunction after learning a tabloid newspaper intended to run a story on his affair with reality TV star Imogen Thomas. But the lawyers forgot the injunction didn’t cover Scotland and so he was named in the Sunday Herald and by , Twitter users. The following day, Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming – who had been campaigning against the use of injunctions – also named him in the House of Commons.As a result of the injunction, Giggs’ infidelity received even more publicity than it would otherwise have done. Soon after, it emerged he had also been having a long-term affair with his brother’s we. Months later, Jeremy Clarkson voluntarily lted a “pointless” injunction on his alleged infidelity after details circulated online. Even where injunctions are still in place, they are not particularly effective. I would wager most readers know the identity of the married actor who had an affair with escort Helen Wood even though I am not allowed to tell you. Ditto the identities of everyone involved in the extra-marital threesome in an olive-oil-filled children’s pool. This is because they were all named in US newspapers and on the internet.Of course, the dference between the injunctions taken out by Giggs, Clarkson et al is that they were attempts to cover up consensual affairs, whereas the allegations against Green involve the harassment of multiple women. Green’s injunction was granted not on the grounds of privacy, but on the grounds of the NDAs.Writing in the , Geoffrey Robertson QC claimed the Court of Appeal decision was inevitable. “Commercial lawyers who later become judges may have an instinctive preference for freedom of contract over freedom of speech, asasked to balance hard cash against hot air,” he said. There is an irony in both Labour and the Conservatives expressing such concern over this case. It was Tony Blair who gave Green his knighthood and David Cameron who asked him to review public sector efficiency. Some cynics might also suspect that the government’s sudden preoccupation with NDAs is a useful deflection away from its own bullying and harassment problem, which has yet to be properly addressed.But NDAs embolden perpetrators and encourage repeat offending and clearly some women do feel pressurised into signing them. Last week on BBC Question Time, SNP MP Hannah Bardell claimed she had once signed one because she feared losing her job.So Women and Equalities Select Committee chair, Maria Miller MP, was justied in calling for a review of their use and legality, following the committee’s report on sexual harassment in the workplace in March. And Theresa May was right to commit to bringing forward the government’s consultation “to seek to improve the regulation around non-disclosure agreements and make it absolutely explicit to employees when a non-disclosure agreement does not apply and when it cannot be enforced”.Whether Hain was right to invoke parliamentary privilege to name Green is a bone of contention. Several legal experts – including Glasgow University law professor James Chalmers – believe it was wrong to do so while the legal proceedings were still ongoing. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio : “We can’t operate a democratic free society when peers or MPs decide to take the law into their own hands.”As for Green, he is now at the centre of a hate-fest. Every negative story ever written about him has resurfaced every anecdote about his sweary brashness has been retold. For the moment he still has his suite at the Dorchester, his yacht, a few loyal friends and his knighthood to console him. How long that will last is anyone’s guess.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820806.1540648488!/image/image.jpg","title":"30 000 take part in teachers march in glasgow to demand better pay","story":"Some , marchers have taken to the streets of Glasgow to support teachers campaigning for a % pay rise, organisers have said.Scotland’s largest teaching union, the EIS, organised the event, with general secretary Larry Flanagan hailing the turnout at the demo as “absolutely magnicent”.Teachers, parents and their children and other campaigners marched from Glasgow’s Kelvingrove Park to George Square, where union leaders and politicians addressed crowds.So large was the rally that reports suggested when the first marchers arrived there, others were still waiting to set off.The EIS has been calling for teachers to be given a % rise to restore the value of salaries following public sector pay caps.A pay offer which would have seen all teachers get a rise of % was rejected last month and was described as “isive”, with issues raised over the parity of pay.Education secretary John Swinney argued the deal would result in all teachers on the main grade scale receiving at least a % increase, with some teachers receiving up to % in one year in conjunction with annual progression.Speaking at the rally in George Square, Mr Flanagan said: “It is absolutely magnicent to look out on this massive demonstration and know that we are here, united, because we believe that the future of Scottish education is worth standing up and fighting for.“Our pay claim is for % - given that the value of take-home pay has dropped by % in the last decade, that claim is already a compromise on what we deserve. And here is the simple fact -you want to have qualied teachers in front of pupils in our schools, you need to address the recruitment and retention crisis we are facing.”EIS president Alison Thornton added: “The salaries of teachers in schools in Scotland are below the European average and those of other countries in the wider world.“Our pupil contact hours are high, and we still work an average of  hours of unpaid overtime each week to deal with the demands of the job.“Austerity doesn’t work, quality public services need proper funding and by investing in teachers then there is investment in education and our young people and their futures.”Local government body Cosla said it took a joint decision with the Scottish Government to write to teachers “spelling out the value and merits of the pay offer currently on the table”.The EIS will open a ballot of its members on Tuesday calling on them to reject the current offer. The ballot closes on November .Mr Swinney said: “I hugely value the work teachers do and the vital contribution they make to improve outcomes for children.“We want teaching to be a rewarding career choice - to keep people in the profession and to attract new entrants - and that is why the Scottish Government is contributing an additional £ million this year for teachers’ pay.“Through a combination of a % increase for all staff earning up to £,, restructuring the main grade scale and annual progression, the majority of teachers receive a rise between % and %. There would be a flat rate increase of £, for those earning more than £, from  April .”The Education Secretary added that reference to conditions of service forming part of the negotiations “is factually incorrect”.He said: “Our offer to teachers is for one year, and compares favourably with the pay award for the majority of health workers of % over three years and the recently announced award .% increase for police officers covering  months.“I firmly believe this is a generous and fair offer which demonstrates the value both the Scottish Government and local government place on the teaching profession.“We remain committed to continuing discussions with teaching unions in good faith.”But Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, who addressed the rally, said it showed “Scotland’s teachers won’t be bullied into accepting another real terms pay cut by the SNP”.He said: “It’s time for Mr Swinney to put a fair pay deal on the table to provide teachers with the respect and due recognition they deserve.”Meanwhile Scottish Green education spokesman Ross Greer hailed the demonstration as being the “largest single-union march in modern history”.He added: “Scotland’s teachers have shown that they are ready to fight to win back some of the % their pay value has lost over the last decade.“John Swinney should stop the threats to undermine unions, ditch his deeply unwanted governance reforms and address the real issues in our schools, namely a much-reduced, demoralised and overwhelmed teaching and support workforce trying to deliver the impossible with not nearly enough resources.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820854.1540664927!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish tories stake reputation on whisky duty freeze","story":"Raising taxes on spirits could stle a boom in Scotland#s national drink and send the whisky industry into reverse, producers have warned on the eve of the UK budget.Fears that the Chancellor is preparing a . per cent hike to spirit duty after a freeze last year have sparked a cross-party campaign to protect hundreds of millions of pounds worth of investment in an industry that directly employs around , people in Scotland.The Scottish Conservatives in particular have made keeping the freeze on spirits duty their top demand for the budget, staking their ability to influence within government as a bloc of  backbench MPs on Philip Hammond’s decision tomorrow.However, while the government has sent strong signals that it will preserve the friendly tax regime for another key Scottish industry – North Sea oil and gas – there have been few public clues about the Chancellor’s thinking on alcohol taxes.The Scotch Whisky Associationestimates that producers have pumped £ million worth of capital investment into the industry over the past  months.Last year saw  new distilleries opened in Scotland, and this summer saw the unveiling of a £m new Macallan distillery and visitor centre near Craigellachie in Speyside.Historic distilleries have been brought back into production at Brora and Port Ellen, and brand new whiskies are now being produced on Raasay and in the Borders.MPs from all four parties representing Scotland at Westminster have lent their support to a high-profile campaign led by the SWA, lobbying the Chancellor in public and in private, and taking part in video messages on social media.Asked whether the industry would be protected during Prime Minister’s Questions this week, Theresa May hailed “robust” efforts by Scottish Conservative MPs but failed to give any assurances.“We were pleased to be able to take the stance that we did on [freezing] the duty [last year], because we recognise the importance of Scotch ​whisky to the UK,” the Prime Minister said. “This is an important industry.”The SNP have warned that an increase in duty would “deliver an economic body blow” to the industry, and Lib Dem and Labour MPs have backed a continued freeze.Moray MP Douglas Ross said whisky distilleries were a “vital employer” in his area and brought a “huge boost in tourism” to Speyside.“Scotch whisky is world renowned and an export powerhouse,” Ross said.“The thriving industry brings many economic benefits to rural communities, not just in Moray but the whole of Scotland.“Thanks to the Conservative spirit duty freeze in previous years it has only gone from strength to strength. My Scottish Conservatives colleagues are determined to see this continue.”While much of the focus is on whisky’s growth potential as an export, the UK remains the fourth biggest market for Scotch in the world.Between  and , when the automatic alcohol duty escalator raised excise on spirits by  per cent, the volume of whisky released for sale in the UK dropped by nearly a fth, from  million cl bottles to  million.Since , duty has only risen by . per cent and UK volumes have picked up, to  million cl bottles released for sale last year.Industry insiders say ato rising spirit duties would hit investment that supports , rural jobs in Scotland and more than , across the UK.Graeme Littlejohn, deputy director at the SWA, said the spirit duty escalator had been “hugely damaging” to the industry and called on the Chancellor to keep tax levels stable.“It is only over the last five years that we have seen the domestic market stabilize, in large part due to the more positive duty policy we have seen since ,” Littlejohn said. “It would be a mistake for the Chancellor toto raising duty on Scotch. There would undoubtedly be a strong reaction from the industry, which the Prime Minister described only this week as important to the UK.“The Chancellor should continue the freeze on spirits duty he put in place just last year, which actually increased government revenue from spirits by  per cent and supported an industry which provides jobs and investment in communities up and down the country.”Charles Ireland, the general manager for Great Britain, Ireland and France at Diageo, whose Scotch whisky brands include Bell’s and Johnnie Walker as well as single malt distilleries including Oban, Dalwhinnie and Lagavulin, said the freeze was essential to ensuring continued investment in production.“Currently  per cent of the total cost of a bottle of Scotch is tax and British drinkers pay over  per cent of all the alcohol duty collected in the whole of the EU, despite only making up  per cent of the population,” Ireland said. “Tomorrow’s Budget is an opportunity for the Chancellor to address these issues by implementing a freeze, providing producers with certainty and encouraging further investment.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820870.1540668787!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland s own amazon blanket bog seeks special un status","story":"The rugged boggy landscape of Scotland#s Flow Country could soon join the Taj Mahal, the Grand Canyon and the Great Barrier Reef as an internationally recognised World Heritage Site.The move depends on a successful bid to the United Nations Educational, Scientic and Cultural Organisation. Scotland already has six recognised Unesco sites – the Heart of Neolithic Orkney, which includes ancient remains at Skara Brae and Maeshowe, the Antonine Wall, Edinburgh’s Old Town and New Town, St Kilda, New Lanark and the Forth Bridge. Now a working group has been set up to push forward the plan to achieve official designation for the Flow Country of Caithness and Sutherland as a natural World Heritage Site. They believe the accolade would benefit local communities, the environment and the economy.Project coordinator, Joe Perry, is in charge of putting together the proposal, which must demonstrate why the place is of “outstanding universal value”.He said: “The north of Scotland is fast becoming a destination for photographers, eco-tourists and heritage enthusiasts. At first glance, it can seem to be a harsh and intimidating environment, but a closer look reveals beautul plants and animals and a human history stretching back thousands of years.“We’ve got to show this blanket bog is not just important for Caithness and Sutherland – it is the best of its kind globally and is universally important. It’s about the habitat itself, because of the sphagnum moss – nowhere  is it quite as deep, full and healthy.”This corner of northern Scotland holds more than , hectares of blanket bog, making it the largest expanse of this wild habitat in Europe.The bogs have been growing for more than , years, since the end of the last ice age, and the peat is now up to  metres deep.Pristine peatlands store vast amounts of carbon and are globally important in the fight against climate change.“This is the Amazon or Barrier Reef of peatlands,” said Perry. “It’s the outstanding example in the whole world, and that’s why Unesco would be impressed by it.”The working group is a collaboration between national and local government, environmental groups, educational bodies and businesses with links to the area.Caithness resident Frances Gunn, who supports the initiative, said: “We live in a wonderful part of the world and now the rest of the world is discovering just how special it is. “We hope this accolade will attract visitors who appreciate the natural world, that they take time to stop, get off the beaten track and learn all about the area and its natural and cultural heritage, rather than rush through to the next stop.”Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive, said: “The Flow Country of Caithness and Sutherland is one of the last true wilderness areas of Europe, home to numerous rare plants, insects and birds. “As far as potential visitors to Scotland are concerned, World Heritage Site status would not only protect this vitally signicant habitat for future generations but lend even greater aura and appeal to one of the country’s most unique landscapes.”Only one site in the UK can be put forward for consideration by Unesco each year.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening.

A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Sunday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island.

The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8680982.1540388113!/image/image.jpg","title":"london support sought for 20 000 jobs blueprint","story":"A delegation from an area rocked by the loss of more than , highly paid manufacturing jobs in recent years is currently in Westminster with a blueprint to revitalise its economy.Business leaders, politicians and council officials from Mid and East Antrim are telling the UK Government of their ambitious plans to deliver economic growth through the proposed £bn Belfast Region City Deal.The substantial economic opportunity includes plans for around £m of investment in Mid and East Antrim, which has suffered signicant job losses with the closures of Michelin and JTI Gallaher in Ballymena.This includes proposals to extend The Gobbins clf path, Islandmagee, the regeneration of Carrickfergus and the creation of an innovation and inspiration centre at the St Patrick’s site in Ballymena.Anne Donaghy, council chief executive, said: “As a council, we are fully committed to supporting business growth and development, and promoting an environment that encourages and facilitates investment in our borough.“We focus our efforts on being an enabler to the wealth creators.

Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels. They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain. “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.“A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8684387.1540633447!/image/image.jpg","title":"competition win up to 10 tickets for this week s calor ni leisure show","story":"Win tickets to the second annual NI Leisure Show which kicks off this Friday, November  and runs until Sunday, November .

We will have state of the art facilities, this will be a top rate training facility for local clubs and schools. Our kids deserve this. There will be high-tech lighting that will illuminate the pitch but won’t effect the houses near by.“It’s vital that local kids get full use of this facility, we want it filled to capacity every day with schools, we envisage coaches training kids here, Gaelic clubs, soccer clubs, after-schools activities and outdoor gym classes. I believe this will transform the community.”Work is due to begin in December andall goes according to plan it should be completed by the end of March.Cllr Baker said the investment by Belfast City Council is a big boost for the community. “This area suffered badly under Lisburn Council and we are delighted now that this huge investment has come into the area. We have a population of just under , people here and they deserve nothing but first class facilities and that’s what we are delivering.“As a father and a member of the community here I would love nothing better than on a Sunday morning having a blitz here, rather than going to other parts of Belfast.

New graves are only available in Blaris cemetery when someone dies, the days of pre-planning your funeral or purchasing multiple graves are gone, we are almost at crisis point with our cemeteries.”Last year Lisburn and Castlereagh Council was tendered for a new cemetery, however the tender was unsuccessful.Cllr Corr said: “Because of boundary changes people in the Colin area are no longer Lisburn Council meaning they will have to pay more to be buried in Blaris because that cemetery  crematorium is no longer in their jurisdiction.“This is reaching crisis point, we need to have a radical approach, review and rethink around the issue of burials, cremations and cemetery spaces. We can’t wait until the day somebody is refused burial because there is no space.”With that in mind Belfast City Council have come up with the new cemeteries working group to look at these issues and to also come up with ideas around the development of our cemeteries.Cllr Corr said: “I am the party representative on the group and we are coming up with some excellent plans. For example, a new multi-million pound upgrade will be going into Roselawn crematorium.“We still need a new cemetery for North and West Belfast, it’s a very sensitive subject.“Our cemeteries are also in a position where they can become historical and tourist attractions. Look at Tom Hartley’s cemetery tours, they tell the tale of our city, from rich tombs and headstones to poor grounds where thousands of our poor are buried.“Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin is one of the main tourist attractions on the island of Ireland, it went from being a crime hotspot to being a place of beauty and interest, because it tells the tale of the formative years around the formation of the Irish Free State – our cemeteries are no dferent.“There have been books written about the City Cemetery and Milltown Cemetery.”Cllr Corr continued: “Clton Street Graveyard contains the graves of some historically signicant families, including the Dunvilles, the Sinclairs and Henry Joy McCracken, one of the leading United Irishmen. It was closed to public access approximately  years ago due to anti-social behavior. This has now decreased and the local area of Henry Place has been re-generated and a new business hub has been formed. The graveyard remains locked due to concern regarding the safety of some of the monuments. There are currently regular requests for access from tourists and visitors with a genealogical or historical interest in the graveyard.“Our social, political, economic and religious history are in our cemeteries and we need to have them as places we can use for education.“Take for example the City Cemetery heritage project, we want to bring tourists, academics and school children in as well as the local community.Our cemeteries are at their safest when people are in them, Tom Hartley’s tours have proved that.“The purpose of this working group is to give an extra edge and focus while giving the issues of graves, cemeteries and monuments the attention they deserve.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newington boss crossan demands swift improvement","story":"Steel and Sons Cup quarter-finalSt James’ Swts vNewington Donegal Celtic ParkNEWINGTON manager, Conor Crossan has demanded an improved showing from his side as they continue the defence of their Steel and Sons Cup title with a quarter-final away trip to St James’ Swts on Saturday. The North Belfast side suffered a - home defeat to Lurgan Celtic earlier this month as they lost ground to Championship  league leaders Annagh United. Last Saturday, they bowed out of the Intermediate Cup following a - penalty shoot-out defeat at Maiden City after the game finished - after  minutes. Crossan feels Saturday’s game is the perfect opportunity for his side to rediscover their form in a competition that is close to their hearts. “We are looking forward to Saturday, hopefully we can get back to winning ways,” said Crossan.“The boys know that the performances haven’t been good enough over the last couple of weeks. “We want to stay in as many cup competitions as we can because of the way the league is structured. “It was a poor result and a poor performance against Lurgan Celtic and we had a few players out last Saturday, but it was sore getting beat on penalties.“You always want to be going into the big games on the back of a win and our form of the last two weeks hasn’t been good. “We are going into this match against a team that has won  from  so they’ll be full of confidence. It will be up to me to get the team up for this game.” As defending champions, Newington will be the favourites to progress, especially considering they play in a higher league. Yet, the progress made by St James’ Swts hasn’t gone unnoticed in the north of the city and Crossan is refusing to underestimate the challenge posed by the Swts at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday. “People might underestimate the Ballymena League, but you have some great teams in that league – the likes of Bangor and Coagh and teams who were in Championship  in recent years,” added the Newington boss. “They are playing at a good level and they have players who have experience of playing in the Irish League. “They’ll be full of confidence and I don’t think they lost too much sleep when they drew us.“They are the type of team who relish the challenge no matter who they face. “They’ve been making noise for a while now.“They will want to build on that start and keep going, but hopefully we can put a stop to that winning run on Saturday.” St James’ Swts assistant manager Dan Murphy, meanwhile, insists the club is “buzzing” ahead of Saturday’s eagerly-anticipated clash with the defending Steel and Sons Cup champions. The West Belfast side have made an incredible start to the   season and have won all  of their game so far. The only stain on an otherwise perfect start came when they lost the points following their - win over last year’s Ballymena and Provincial League winners Glebe after it emerged one of their players should have been serving a suspension arising from a ban with his previous club. St James’ are aiming to go a step further than they managed in last season’s competition when they bowed out after losing - to Linfield Swts in the last eight.  “The whole club is buzzing, we know how big this competition is. We got to this stage last year and we lost out to Linfield Swts,” said Murphy. “We were - down and we gave a penalty away and went - down. “We got a goal back and we threw everything at them to get an equaliser and we make a silly mistakes and they broke and made it -. “It was a bit gut-wrenching. We wanted to go on further in the competition and we are just hoping to go one step further this year and make it into the semi-finals.” Last season, the Swts challenged for promotion from the Ballymena and Provincial League Premier Division, but fell short at the end of a busy campaign. This season, they are, strictly speaking, unbeaten on the pitch and Murphy feels that is in no small part because of the summer signings made by manager Damien McStravick. “Last year, we knew we had a good team and we were playing good football,” said Murphy. “Towards the end of the season, it was just injuries and suspensions that killed us.“Our squad was a bit light and a few boys had to play with knocks. “During the summer, we made some brilliant signings thanks to Damien McStravick. He met boys who had played at a higher level and sold them on the ethos of the club. “We ended up with a smashing squad. “We kept all the players we had last year and we’ve added a bit more quality to it. “The new boys have all bought into what the club is about and they are enjoying their football.” This Saturday, St James’ bid to continue their incredible start to the season by dumping the holders out of the Steel and Sons Cup. However, Murphy is expecting a tough battle from the North Belfast side given that Newington went on to defeat Linfield Swts in last year’s Christmas Day final at Seaview. “They are a very dogged team and they work hard for each other. They are able to take their chances when they get them,” added the St James’ Swts assistant. “We also know they are the champions of this competition and they’re no going to let go of it easily. “We played them in pre-season and we won that game -, but they signed well after that game. “We know we are going to be up against it and it will be a real test. “We have to be at our best, but the way we are playing, I thinkwe show up on the day, we can win the game.” Newington will be without the suspended duo of Gavin Taggart and Kevin Bradley for Saturday’s clash while St James’ Swts are set to be at full strength for the quarter-final tie."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sf%e2%80%88asked to take","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw has called for the removal of the election-style anti-Brexit posters erected by Sinn Féin in parts of the constituency.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

Delamont already has stunning picturesque walks, a childrenrsquos adventure playground, miniature railway and cafe, but more investment is needed to enhance what it has to offer.Cllr Walker said creating new attractions will increase the parkrsquos profile and attract even more visitors.He added: ldquoI have always argued Delamont offers massive tourist potential and that with some imaginative thinking and new investment, it can rival any country park in Ireland.

As I was always in the public eye, it was dreadful, said Naomi.ldquoIrsquove lost about half of the weight that I put on and have still about two and a half stone to lose yet.ldquoBecause of the stroke, I also wasnrsquot able to walk when I got home and I wasnrsquot talking right.

She loved her cake and all the party food.ldquoIt was great to be able to share some of the positive aspects of Meganrsquos le with our family, friends and supporters as there has been so much dficulty along the way.It was very much a family affair attended by Meganrsquos siblings, Hannah, Lily and Stuart, great grandmother Mrs Rosaleen Traynor and her aunt Kelly, who provides a lot of her care.Megan will never have the le that she should have had because of her condition.In many ways, even though the Traynors went on to have three other children who donrsquot have the condition, they were robbed of their hopes and dreams for their first-born.But Megan and her parents felt that it was only right that they should include people at the party who have helped them along their journey so far.In  more than pound, was raised to help Megan become one of the first children from the UK to have pioneering stem cell treatment in China.Unlike some other children who benefited from the controversial treatment, it did not cure or help Meganrsquos blindness.But the Traynors believe that it did help Megan in her mental development at the time, although that has now halted.When her epilepsy and major seizures began to impact on her already compromised quality of le, the local community again rallied around in  to help the Traynors create a safe back garden with sensory equipment, complete with a small hydrotherapy pool to help calm her.Leanne knows that they have been blessed with a lot of help, support and generosity from the local community.ldquoAll I know is that there are a lot of very good people in the Downpatrick area who really pull together when people need help, said Leanne.ldquoThey are people who have helped us and raised money, or who helped get us equipment or whatever, every time we needed it.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

They would probably demand more, particularlythe Tory-DUP agreement fell.None of what he said was surprising. Indeed, it was obvious.It is worth reflecting on how the republican movement, unlike anyone  in the political process, feels it can make such demands.This week the Renewable Heat Incentiveinquiry hearings came to an end.This newspaper, despite being one of the UK’s smaller regional daily newspapers, has been the place to read about RHI. Day after day, Sam McBride has filed thousands of words on the hearings. It was clear from the beginning that inquiry would be uncomfortable for the DUP. Some people remarked upon the fact that the News Letter, a strongly unionist newspaper, has covered the scandal so closely but few people now question the signicance of the story.On Wednesday, the only member of Sinn Fein to appear before the inquiry, Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, did so. For three and a half hours the former finance minister gave testimony as to Sinn Fein’s approach to governance and RHI. I was sitting in the press gallery, as I was when other key witnesses such as Jonathan Bell and Arlene Foster testied.Mr Ó Muilleoir’s evidence sounded so relentlessly sanctimonious that I wonderedactually he was rather rattled by having to appear as a witness, orhegenuinely was as sure of his own and his party’s moral goodness as he sounded.After outlining the punctilious, by-the-book way Sinn Fein appoints its Spads, and after even at points spelling out how this rectitudecontrasted with the DUP omissions, he without apparent embarrassment explained how they kept on a Sinn Fein advisor, who could no longer serve as a Spad . This advisor stayed on at Stormont so that he in fact sat above the Spads.The said law had been sponsored on by Jim Allister MLA, inspired by Ann Travers, after Mary McArdle who was convicted in connection with the murder of Ann’s sister Mary, was appointed a Spad.Mr Ó Muilleoir described the Spad law that his party tried to circumvent via a ‘Super Spad’ was an “attack on the peace process”.Road schemes finally get go-ahead yet keep hitting legal problems Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He breezily dismissed the repeated evidence that Sinn Fein battled in early  to keep the RHI scheme kept open. During his testimony an email, which like others was shown on a screen to the chamber, was from Michelle O’Neill referring to people being “left high and dry”. Sinn Fein did all this out of concern for scheme users, he said.SF brought down Stormont because, perhaps above all their other grievances, of RHI. Schools and hospitals remain rudderless. The party has preached about RHI ever since, and yet it was lobbying hard for it to be kept open.On Wednesday, Mr Ó Muilleoir, even when self critical, was so with apparent self regard. “I make no apologies,” he said at point, “I make no excuses for myself.”He brushed off the role of Ted Howell, the senior republican, whose name appears in e-mails in late . Mr Howell’s emergence was the fault of the DUP, because he had been brought in to deal with the political crisis they created.Mr Ó Muilleoir did not appear to miss a beat when questioned by the inquiry about the line where he asked Mr Howell in an email: “Would you be contentI were to sign off on the business plan on Wednesday afternoon ” It was a request about timing, not a request for permission.Mr Ó Muilleoir also explained that his baffling initial hesitancy to call a public inquiry was, in part, because the family of the murdered solicitor Pat Finucane opposed the  Inquiries Act. This was one of a couple of points on Wednesday when Sir Patrick Coghlingot irritable with Mr Ó Muilleoir’s evidence.But the latter only endured an afternoon of scrutiny.One thing that has emerged from the RHI inquiry is that devolved government needs greater scrutiny.There has been little scrutiny of the suggestion in the  paramilitary report that the IRA army council exerts influence on Sinn Fein.There was no scrutiny of the IRA spying at Stormont or break-in at Castlereagh that led to direct rule in  . All politicians were punished, not just republican ones.There was no proper scrutiny of the later Northern Bank heist, the murders of Robert McCartney, of Paul Quinn or Kevin McGuigan.London could have examined all those controversies and others, such as the Colombia IRA-FARC episode in -, given the global climate towards terrorism after .It never did.The DUP could have toppled Stormont with good cause after the  report but never did, or after the On The Runs secret scheme.Many people in Northern Ireland, mostly unionist but also people across the spectrum who would eschew that term, are getting increasingly angry at the sense that Sinn Fein get special dispensation.The law was changed to give it allowances at Westminster while it continued to boycott it.Martin McGuinness told Saville’s Bloody Sunday inquiry he was constrained in what he could say by “a republican code of honour”.Latterly the political wing of the IRA, which killed far more people than any other group, has made demands on legacy before Stormont can , seemingly unafraid of the proposed legacy structures.In this paper last week the ex assistant chief constable and Assets Recovery Agency head Alan McQuillan warned of pressure “not least from the two governments” not to pursue those whose arrest might “destabilise the peace process”.Remember that as elderly soldiers face trial for single shootings in the Troubles, no leaders of the IRA who orchestrated decades of violence faced charges akin to directing terrorism.Does it ever occur to London that allegations of illegal or undemocratic behaviour might be as deserving of public scrutiny as RHI You might expect a Tory government propped up unionists, an Alliance Party that holds the balance of power, a Fine Gael government, and indeed that wing of the SDLP that hated the IRA, to agree on this. But there is no such consensus. There is no demand from any of the above for reform of republican practice before Stormont s.Instead, Sinn Fein will “raise the bar” before Stormont can .If the past is anything to go by, everyone will probably jump to it.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorJohnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8684454.1540645310!/image/image.jpg","title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Legacy scandal: lsquoThe principle thou shalt not upset the terrorists dictates our approach to the past,rsquo says Austin StackIn the latest essay in our series, AUSTIN STACK says the IRA shot his prison officer father because he thwarted their efforts to escape: Opinion,     .RHI Inquiry: Arlene Fosterrsquos sworn evidence about me canrsquot be right, says Andrew McCormickAn account of what happened on the night of Stephen Nolan#s seminal interview with Arlene Foster where she responded to Jonathan Bell#s allegations simply cannot be accurate, a senior civil servant has told the RHI Inquiry.News,  ..DUP Spad told me ldquowe could fill our boots with RHI cash, says top civil servantArlene Foster#s long-standing special adviser who is accused of having deliberately delayed cost controls on the RHI scheme later told a top civil servant he thought #we could fill our boots# with money, the RHI Inquiry has heard.

Andrew McCormick had been permanent secretary in Mrs Fosters Stormont department The inquiry has heard several pieces of evidence which show that Mrs Foster’s closest advisers – who spent hours preparing her for the huge interview – had been aware of the allegation that it was Mrs Foster’s special adviserAndrew Crawford who had worked in the shadows to delay cost controls.Although he has always denied that, senior civil servant Andrew McCormick – who had been in the department running the scheme at the point where the delay happened – had told Mrs Foster’s key advisers Timothy Johnston and Richard Bullick that it was his belief that Dr Crawford was behind the delay.However, Mrs Foster’s version of events – which like Dr McCormick’s evidence was given under oath – was that Dr McCormick had never said that directly to her until after the interview.Last month she told the inquiry: “Well, I became aware of his belief after the recording of ‘The Nolan Show’. As I said, ‘The Nolan Show’ was recorded in my office, my First Minister office.“Opposite my First Minister’s office is the junior minister’s office, and, once the recording was over, I went into the junior minister’s office. I think Richard and Timothy stayed behind to speak to Mr Nolan and try and correct some of the misapprehensions he had around the scheme...and then Andrew, as I recall, and, I think, Simon Hamilton, although I don’t have it in my statement, but I think Simon was around as well — and Andrew sheepishly said it was his belief that Andrew Crawford had delayed the scheme. “So it was after the recording, as it were, of The Nolan Show that I had that direct intervention from Andrew McCormick.”Mrs Foster appeared to have a clear memory of some conversation with Dr McCormick about the issue, recalling that he had been “sheepish”.She went on to say: “Whether it was that evening, which I believe it was, or whether it was the next day, it certainly was after ‘The Nolan Show’ that I spoke directly to Andrew about the issue.”DUP minister Simon Hamilton, who was also there that night, gave similar evidence to the inquiry about a conversation with Dr McCormick “definitely after the interview”.However, Dr McCormick said thatthat conversation did occur it could not have been after the recording – and therefore would have to have been before Mrs Foster told the public she had “no idea” why cost controls were delayed.Dr McCormick said that the DUP had kept him at Stormont Castle so that he – as someone outside the party whose integrity was respected – could assert to Mr Nolan that a ‘fact sheet’ prepared for the broadcaster was accurate.

That, Dr McCormick told the inquiry, had left him “very frustrated that having been kept waiting in the expectation of a substantive engagement with Stephen Nolan, [it] didn’t happen and I went straight home – so there is no possibility that I had a meeting with Arlene Foster or Simon Hamilton that evening between the recording, which happened between eight and nine, and the broadcast of the Nolan interviews later that evening.“That could not possibly have happened. And indeed the next day, the minutes of the NICS board record me as being at the NICS board from first thing on Friday morning. I had the conversation with Tim Cairns [as well as] with Chris Stewart in Netherleigh around lunch time that day. I had the long phone call with Máirtín Ó Muilleoir and his colleagues later that day.“I don’t see any possibility – and I would remember going to Stormont Castle to meet the First Minister – I didn’t do that on the Friday, and I was at home all weekend, so that, I’m afraid, is not possible – it’s not possible for what Arlene Foster and Simon Hamilton have described to have happened.”Later,when Mrs Foster’s interview being broadcast, Dr McCormick texted DUP Spads in incredulity at her “no idea” answer. He wrote: “Dficult to understand why she said she had no idea...when I have said I would have to tell [a Stormont committee] that”.Mrs Foster went on to give a statement tot he Assembly several days later which also left Dr McCormick concerned as to her level of candour.Yesterday Dr McCormick told the inquiry: “I’m very concerned by what I’ve had to say this morning.” He said his concern related both to what Mrs Foster told the BBC and to what she told the Assembly.He also told the inquiry that he had a clear memory from the night when the Nolan interview was recorded in Stormont Castle of someone saying “we don’t want to name Andrew Crawford because he’s done nothing wrong” but he could not recall who had said it.try catch     .               ..

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty. But notwithstanding that the behaviour of the economy is buoyant, he said.The Chancellor was handed an unexpected pre-Budget boost by the Office for Budget Responsibility which suggested stronger than expected tax receipts and slower Government borrowing could hand him an additional pound billion.He made clear he was determined to maintain long-term investment in the countryrsquos infrastructure.ldquoSometimes the easiest thing for a government to cut in the short termitrsquos under pressure is capital investment, he said.ldquoIt is the spending on the skills of the next generation, the infrastructure, including the digital infrastructure, the broadband infrastructure.ldquoFor the st century broadband is to roads in the th, railways in the th, and canals in the th.

Thatrsquos not my vision for the future of this country.After having previously having clashed with Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson over defence funding, Mr Hammond indicated there would be extra cash in the Budget for the armed forces.Thesaid there could be a cash injection for the military of up to pound billion ahead of a long-term spending settlement next year.ldquoYou are looking at someone who was defence secretary for three years.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %. We also welcome the news that Primark will open again soon as it will serve as a footfall draw to this part of the city which has been devastated. We now look the Chancellor and his budget next week to seecentral government will step up to support the city centre.” The latest footfall figures from the NIRC showed footfall across the city was down by more than % in September.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
