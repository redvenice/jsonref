The Russian Navy showed off its ships and sailors near St Petersburg as the country marked Navy Day.

Today\u0027s parade, the biggest in years, included 43 ships and submarines and 4,000 troops         Putin was spending the weekend away from Moscow, the Russian capital, where nearly 1,400 people were detained Saturday in a violent police crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.

Activists said the crackdown was the harshest since a wave of anti-Kremlin protests in 2011-12.Opinion polls in the past have shown support for Navalny, a lawyer and anti-corruption activist, only in the single digits. But backers note he won almost a third of the vote in a 2013 Moscow mayoral race and say his movement could build momentum in the Russian capital if allowed to compete fairly.OVD-Info, an independent monitoring group, said police detained at least 1,373 people before or at Saturday\u0027s protest. As in past sweeps, many were only held for a matter of hours.Police put participation at more than 3,500 people, of whom it said around 700 people were journalists and bloggers. Activists said the number attending was likely to have been much higher.          Another parachutist displayed the Russian flag as they jumped from a plane flying in the skies above St Petersburg today         Elite members of the Russian navy parade their fearsome weapons in the air during the Navy Day celebrations       Older Russian ships also took part in the parade.

Reuters witnesses said some of those detained appeared to be ordinary passersby in the wrong place at the wrong time.Though Putin\u0027s approval rating is still high at well over 60 percent, it is lower than it used to be due to discontent over years of falling incomes. Last year, the 66-year-old former KGB intelligence officer won a landslide re-election and a new six-year term until 2024.Burnishing his man of action image, Putin spent Saturday ing to the bottom of the Gulf of Finland in a mini-submarine to honour a Soviet submarine that sunk there in World War Two.           Russian president Vladimir Putin ed to the bottom of the Gulf of Finland yesterday aboard a submersible to explore a Soviet submarine which was sunk during World War Two         Among the Russian military assets on display was the Korolyov large landing ship, which was pictured releasing a BTR-82A amphibious armoured personnel carrier into the water in St Petersburg       This Russian rescue crew member looked to be having a little too much fun as he leaped into the water while wearing his buoyant waterproof suit          The rescue personnel demonstrated their impressive floating suits by lying on the surface of the water during today\u0027s parade         Members of the navy also took part in a demonstration of a water rescue and they stood out in their bright orange waterproof suits         Last month, Putin taunted the UK over the Tory leadership race by suggesting that Russia was more of a democracy than Britain.

The EU must come to the table and commit - at the very least - to matching the UK\u0027s sensible mitigations. \u0027Failure to do so will hurt all our economies. While the UK\u0027s preparations to date are welcome, the unprecedented nature of Brexit means some aspects cannot be mitigated. We can reduce but not remove the damage of no deal.\u0027It\u0027s not just about queues at ports the invisible impact of severing services trade overnight would harm firms across the country. Preparing for no deal is devilishly difficult. But it is right to prepare.\u0027The group welcomed Britain\u0027s preparations for Brexit, but said that the \u0027unprecedented nature\u0027 of exiting the bloc meant \u0027some aspects cannot be mitigated\u0027.The CBI also said: \u0027The EU lags behind the UK in seeking to prevent the worst effects of a No Deal scenario.\u0027And although businesses have already spent billions on contingency planning for no-deal, they remain hampered by unclear advice, timelines, cost and complexity.\u0027The report - titled What Comes Next? The Business Analysis Of No Deal Preparations - added: \u0027Larger companies, particularly those in regulated areas such as financial services, have well-thought-through contingency plans in place, though smaller firms are less well prepared.\u0027In late May, the CBI warned against a no-deal Brexit, with its director-general Carolyn Fairbairn saying it should be an option \u0027that is not even considered\u0027.         In its latest report, the confederation advised the Government to undertake a review and to update all technical notices and Brexit preparation advice by the middle of August.The CBI also recommended business engagement meetings with the EU resume and additional parliamentary time be set aside to complete no-deal legislation by the end of August.A communications campaign with \u0027simple and clear advice\u0027 for UK firms would need to be launched by the beginning of September, while by the start of the next month the Government would need to publish its \u0027crucial preparedness measures\u0027, it said.The CBI said trials of Britain\u0027s crucial IT systems would need to be scaled up by the middle of October.The confederation also recommended that the EU begin drafting communications and devising temporary measures in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The CBI\u0027s head of EU negotiations Nicole Sykes said \u0027a lot needs to be done, by everyone\u0027.But she warned in a series of tweets that even with more preparations, there would still be adverse effects from a no deal Brexit.

No Deal, the head of the company warned today.   Carlos Tavares, chief executive of parent firm PSA, threatened to move construction of future Vauxhall Astras and Opel Astras to southern Europe if post-Brexit trading terms were not satisfactory.The move would almost certainly lead to the closure of the site in Cheshire, putting 1,000 jobs at risk.Mr Tavares told the Financial Times: \u0027Frankly I would prefer to put it (the Astra car) in Ellesmere Port but if the conditions are bad and I cannot make it profitable then I have to protect the rest of the company and I will not do it.\u0027We have an alternative to Ellesmere Port.\u0027           Shifting production of future Astra models from Ellesmere Port (file picture) would almost certainly lead to the closure of the site in Cheshire, putting 1,000 jobs at riskThe warning came after the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders told Mr Johnson on Friday that a no-deal Brexit was an \u0027existential threat\u0027 to the industry.Over the weekend, Mr Johnson set up a new structure of Government committees to try to ensure Brexit by Halloween.The Daily Operations Committee, chaired by Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, will meet every weekday in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms and will be responsible for overseeing all of the Government\u0027s preparations for leaving the EU, and a possible no-deal exit.The committee will meet for the first time tomorrow and a Downing Street source said it was being structured in such a way so that the Treasury would be \u0027a motor for delivering Brexit, not the anchor\u0027.Downing Street has also announced an Exit, Economy and Trade Committee will be chaired by the Prime Minister and meet regularly.It will \u0027have a broad remit and will handle write rounds\u0027, particularly focused on Britain\u0027s future relationships around the world.The Exit Strategy committee, known as XS, will meet twice a week and be chaired by the PM.XS will meet for the first time on Monday, when it will be chaired by Mr Gove in the absence of the Prime Minister.Mr Johnson will chair the following meeting of the committee on Thursday, Downing Street said.The Daily Telegraph, meanwhile, reported that Mr Johnson was set to launch the biggest advertising campaign since the Second World War to get Britain ready for a no-deal Brexit.A £100 million advertising campaign will be launched to prepare the country for no-deal, according to the newspaper.Newly appointed trade minister Conor Burns welcomed the Brexit ad blitz but criticised the previous Government\u0027s failure to adequately fund for no-deal.He told BBC Radio 4 Westminster Hour: \u0027It is really important that businesses that are not yet geared up, get geared up because this is hoving into reality.\u0027It is a very serious possibility and I just wish the previous government which was not led by Boris had got on with this a lot earlier.\u0027           Over the weekend, Boris Johnson (pictured giving a speech in Manchester on Saturday) set up a new structure of Government committees to try to ensure Brexit by HalloweenMr Burns added: \u0027Showing that we are aggressively preparing, showing that the Treasury Hammond gloom is behind us and the Treasury are financing the preparations for no-deal is the best way for us to approach our European partners and say, \u0027look we want a deal and let\u0027s get back round the table and let\u0027s sort this out\u0027.\u0027I just wish the previous government which was not led by Boris had got on with this a lot earlier.\u0027The Institute for Government (IfG) has advised Mr Johnson that a no-deal Brexit would dominate Government\u0027s agenda \u0027for years to come\u0027.The Prime Minister will need to kick-start the Government\u0027s no-deal preparations immediately by moving thousands of public servants into operational facilities, the IfG said in a paper released on Sunday.It added that Mr Johnson would also have to introduce legislation ensuring direct rule in Northern Ireland from October 31.Regardless of these measures, after a no-deal Brexit the resources of the Parliament and civil service would be drained and struggling businesses would need Government support, the IfG paper said."},{"url":null,"title":"Muslim parents refuse let children flu vaccine treatment not

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First, a surprising reading experience for BMacLean:Over the past year or so, I’ve been reading on and off an Oxford paperback collection of Mallarmé’s poems. After not having looked at it the last few months, I picked it up again about a week ago and continued from where’d I’d left off.Much to my surprise, I found the poems in this middle section of the book noticeably more straightforward and easy to follow compared to my previous experience with this poet, notoriously oblique and difficult to interpret. “He must have drastically changed his approach to writing after a certain point in his life,” I thought, “Or no, wait - I must be getting smarter!”Much pleased and encouraged, I carried on with renewed enthusiasm. It wasn’t until a few days later that I noticed I wasn’t reading Mallarmé at all – it was an Oxford paperback Verlaine with a similar cover.The Past by Tessa Hadley has provoked lonelybloomer to ask some difficult questions:What can be as good as The Past by Tessa Hadley? I love a novel where a bunch of people have gathered in a remote home to vacation for a month or so, and to stir some old pains and quarrels. Can anyone recall this plot, done as nicely as Hadley’s book?Wow. A cross between Elmore Leonard and Neil Gaiman. Can’t quite believe she’s South African, by which I mean her grasp of US reality (Detroit), her rendering of the speech rhythms is pitch perfect.Vassily Grossman’s Life and Fate has impressed Bloreheath:A really great novel, in the classic Russian mould. One thing, among many, Russian writers could do was somehow to lend importance to persons who may initially seem perfectly ordinary — which may indeed mean most of us. No gimmicks here, none of what Angus Wilson called “the high jinks of experimentalism”, just wonderful straight writing.Offshore by Penelope Fitzgerald has received a gold start from safereturndoubtful:Set in 1962 in Battersea Reach on the Thames the story is of the residents of permanently moored boats, considered by house dwellers then as being somewhat strange. The focus is on Nenna and her two daughters as she considers the future for her and the girls estranged from her husband and the children not attending school. She confides in Maurice, another boat-dweller, also male prostitute and storer of stolen goods. I’ve a favourite few pages when the Austrian boy, Heinrich, visits. A novella with a huge amount crammed in, Fitzgerald’s character development sneaks up on you, so much so that after only a few pages you feel you know the boat folk well. There’s occasional bursts of humour, that are even better appreciated when re-read, and an abrupt ending that may not surprise, but is extremely rewarding.A View From The Foothills by Chris Mullin has provided good bedtime reading for greenmill:It’s late 1999 and Mullin is a junior minister in John Prescott’s environment etc department. Mullin’s deadpan, self-deprecating humour is a delight. He is also generous to others (even some Tories) and is warming to Prescott despite his boss’s complete lack of management skills as he glimpses the fundamentally decent human being which lurks beneath the motor-mouth exterior. He quotes Simon Hoggart in the  reporting on a Prescott speech at that year’s Labour Party Conference “he announced the creation of two new National Parks in the way you might announce the annexation of the Sudetenland”.And pubbore “finally” got round to Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury:Absolutely brilliant and scarily prescient of course, but I’m more affected by Bradbury’s afterword: ‘the fire chief in mid-novel says it all, predicting the one-minute TV commercial with three images per second and no respite from the bombardment. Listen to him, know what he says, then go sit with your child, open a book and turn the page.’If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

It will be chaired by the Just Eat chairman, Mike Evans, while the Takeaway chairman, Adriaan Nühn, becomes vice-chairman. The Just Eat chief financial officer, Paul Harrison, will take on the same role for the combined group, and its interim chief executive, Peter Duffy, will leave.Groen has described the UK as one of the best three markets in Europe, along with the Netherlands and Poland. Takeaway was founded in 2000 and operates in 10 European countries as well as Israel and Vietnam but does not have a presence in the UK. The two companies have little geographical overlap apart from Switzerland.Analysts at Barclays said: “Just Eat shareholders would be getting the best operator in the space to run the business – a notable shift from missed execution from management in the last few years.”There has been a flurry of deals in the fast-growing online food delivery market, with competition heating up from Uber Eats and Deliveroo. Just Eat bought UK firm HungryHouse in January 2018, and in December Takeaway acquired Delivery Hero’s food delivery business in Germany.The Canaccord analyst Nigel Parson said: “It is a possibility that Delivery Hero could table a rival bid.”Just Eat has come under pressure from its activist shareholder Cat Rock Capital to merge with Takeaway, in which the US hedge fund also holds a stake.Just Eat gained more than 4 million customers last year across Europe, Canada, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand. Its revenues are expected to top £1bn this year. It made a pretax profit of £101.7m last year, following a £76m loss in 2017. It will publish first-half results on Wednesday.In 2018, Just Eat had 26.3m customers while Takeaway had 14.1m, Just Eat had 221m orders versus Takeaway’s 94m Just Eat’s revenue was £780m versus Takeaway’s €232m and Just Eat’s underlying profit (Ebitda) was £180m versus an adjusted loss of €11m for Takeaway.Launched by five Danish entrepreneurs in 2001, Just Eat originally linked customers to restaurants that handled their own deliveries. Its former chief executive Peter Plumb, who left suddenly in January, upgraded its technology and launched its own delivery service but he came under fire from Cat Rock and other shareholders after his investment drive slowed earnings growth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecc9b9ab79d4c8d80e2d87c227ac05ac78031d69/364_757_6291_3776/master/6291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd879e74c041c22ee4d8a29f438aae1","title":"simon fox daily mirror reach ladbrokes coral jim mullen","story":"Former Ladbrokes Coral boss Jim Mullen to take over at UK’s largest regional newspaper groupSimon Fox, the chief executive of the company that owns the Mirror, Express and Star newspapers, is to step down and will be replaced by the former Ladbrokes Coral boss Jim Mullen.Fox has led Reach, the national and regional newspaper group formerly known as Trinity Mirror, since 2012, joining after he abruptly resigned as chief executive of HMV. Fox will leave Reach on 16 August.He will be replaced by Mullen, who left Ladbrokes Coral last year after its £4bn takeover by GVC and has previously held roles including digital strategy director at News UK, owner of the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times.“I am delighted to be joining Reach at such an exciting time and look forward to building upon its digital transformation,” said Mullen.Under Fox, Reach’s share price has almost tripled as the business has made a series of acquisitions to build scale as the newspaper market has struggled from declining sales of printed copies and the shift of digital advertising spend to Silicon Valley giants Google and Facebook.Last year, Reach paid £200m to acquire Richard Desmond’s media assets including the Express and Star, as well as celebrity magazine OK!. The company, which is the UK’s largest regional newspaper group, bought Local World, a group of more than 80 regional newspapers, for £220m in 2015. Fox’s biggest strategic gaffe was the launch of national newspaper the New Day, which was shut after just two months.“There is never an ideal time to leave an organisation, but if there were it would be now,” said Fox. “The integration of the Express and Star has been successfully completed, digital growth is accelerating and our trading and cash position are strong.”“I am pleased with our robust performance in the first half of the year and with the strengthening of our digital audience and revenue growth in quarter two,” said Fox. “We remain focused on cost and cash management.”Earlier this month, Reach confirmed it was in discussions to acquire some of the titles owned by JPI Media, which publishes the i as well as local and regional newspapers including the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/947188ff84198d193f0c360466db3ae2bc376ccc/0_0_3412_2047/master/3412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81f7e03fccb63e78ad5982005b8ae54b","title":"sports direct shares results mike ashley house of fraser","story":"Mike Ashley group warned of ‘terminal’ House of Fraser problems and £605m tax bill Shares in Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct crashed by more than a quarter after the retailer’s disastrous annual results announcement on Friday, a chaotic day during which there were several delays and shock financial revelations.The results were published after the stock market closed on Friday and revealed that Sports Direct was struggling amid tough trading conditions on the high street.“The home truths about the core Sports Direct business were pretty shocking and management seems to be out of ideas,” said analysts at brokerage Peel Hunt. “Whilst Sports Direct may have done all the likes of Nike and Adidas asked them to do in the flagship stores, the premium product that maybe it was expecting as a consequence has not emerged. And it doesn’t sound like that is about to change.”“We are disappointed how Friday played out but it’s far more worrying that Sports Direct now seems to be strategically snookered, checkmated and clean bowled. The shares are hard to value, but are surely only for the very brave.”David Cumming, the chief investment officer for equities and head of UK equities at Aviva Investors, told the BBC on Monday: “Sports Direct is almost a case study in failed corporate governance.” He said Ashley “has obviously got retail talent – or had retail talent”, but the firm had “lost its way”.Justin Urquhart Stewart, a fund manager at Seven Investment Management, said the delayed publication of the results was “frankly a pathetic way to run a business”.In the annual results, Ashley warned that the state of House of Fraser, which his company bought out of administration last year, had created “significant uncertainty” as to the future profitability of the entire group. He warned of further store closures at House of Fraser and said he regretted the acquisition.The billionaire retail tycoon has gone on a buying spree in the past 18 months, with Sports Direct also acquiring Evans Cycles, Sofa and Game Digital."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f499510675b42ffd8fbb0fd1d50a17643c2abd8/0_176_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5f840e2c0f3188ee2e5c8a69552883b","title":"jacob rees mogg language rules","story":"His linguistic intolerance suggests a personality that values order and obedience above allJacob Rees-Mogg must be in seventh heaven right now. His obsession with anachronistic rules and rituals finally has a professional justification. Boris Johnson has made him leader of the House of Commons, a British institution more steeped in arcane ritual than almost any other. He even has a bonus title, Lord President of the Council, complete, no doubt, with complicated modes of address. I’m sure he’s checked the entry in Debrett’s and will be correcting anyone who gets it wrong.Because he’s a stickler for that kind of thing: it emerged at the end of last week that he has a list of banned words and style rules that he asks members of staff to apply in written communication. (How he polices oral communication is unknown. One thing I would say: it’s probably best to avoid asking him where the toilet is.)We all have style preferences, and there’s nothing wrong with expressing them – as long as you don’t claim they’re the only “correct” way of doing things. But the words and phrases Rees-Mogg has singled out are revealing, if not exactly surprising.Among his recommendations, Rees-Mogg asks that “all non-titled males” are given the abbreviation Esq., for esquire, after their name. Esquire is a pretty outmoded honorific that technically designates a man below the rank of a knight. It derives from the Latin scutarius, meaning “shield bearer”, and entered English via the Old French escuier. There’s almost something egalitarian about the fact that Rees-Mogg wants everyone to get a whiff of aristocracy, even if they don’t have a dukedom or whatnot. But then you remember that there is, of course, no female equivalent.And now for the banned words. Since the 17th century “hopefully” has been used as an adverb, modifying a verb to suggest that the action is done “in a hopeful way”. For example, you might say: “He asked for some more food, hopefully.” Since roughly the second half of the 20th century more and more people have used it to modify whole sentences, to mean “it is hoped that”. So, “hopefully it won’t rain tomorrow” (though there’s evidence that this goes back to at least the 18th century). In any case, it’s now completely normal. Rees-Mogg is evidently one of those who detests this hopefully as a hideous innovation. But the fact he doesn’t specify it’s sentential hopefully he’s worried about shows he already recognises it is the standard usage. As elsewhere, the world has moved on but he hasn’t.This is a bit mystifying, as it’s not a word generally disparaged in old-fashioned style guides. Could it be that Rees-Mogg sees it as redolent of various politically correct catchphrases, like equal opportunities, equal rights or (probably his biggest bugbear) equal marriage, which he voted against on seven separate occasions?There are a couple of ways of indicating possession in English, namely “have” and “have got”: “I have a cat” vs “I’ve got a cat”. The latter is usually judged to be slightly less formal, which is presumably why Rees-Mogg hates it. But the ban appears to be a blanket one: got is cast out even where it’s just the past tense of the innocent verb get (as in “he got me a present”). This is strange, since get, as the linguist John McWhorter pointed out in a recent episode of his podcast, is a hugely important part of the lexical scaffolding of English. Does Rees-Mogg feel it’s been contaminated by association with the informal “have got” construction? Does it just sound a bit too “common”?The usual objection to “meet with” is that the preposition is redundant. “I met with Juncker” and “I met Juncker”, is it argued, mean the same thing, so it’s foolish to add the “with” (god help you if you say “met up with”). Except that redundancy is a natural and ubiquitous feature of English and of most languages. Does Rees-Mogg also object to “sit down”?Some believe that “due to” should only modify a noun, behaving in the same way as “attributable to” would. Thus, you can say “the loss was due to his poor performance” but not “he lost due to his poor performance”. In the latter case, traditionalists say, you must use “because of”. But because of and due to are used interchangeably by the vast majority of native speakers of English. And our only meaningful guide to how words work is how most people use them (ask the compilers of the Oxford English Dictionary). In what sense is a distinction a distinction if hardly anyone recognises it?It’s interesting to ponder why Rees-Mogg feels the sting of these “mistakes” so keenly. In fact, some work has been done on the personality traits of people who get irritated by what they perceive to be grammatical errors. They score highly on measures of conscientiousness. What does that mean? As one researcher puts it: “A high score on conscientious implies strong industriousness, impulse control, dutifulness, sense of organisation, adherence to norms and rules and a preference for order and dependability.” Although that doesn’t predict a highly conservative outlook, it’s certainly compatible with it. It also squares with the so-called authoritarian personality type that was most likely to vote Brexit and features “a strong desire for order, obedience, conformity”.So Rees-Mogg’s hidebound rules are exactly what you’d expect from a man on the rightmost reaches of a rightwing party. The only question is whether his love of order is compatible with the no-deal Brexit he’s pushing. Hopefully, we won’t have to find out.• David Shariatmadari is a  editor and writer.

Since Brigitte Bardot became famed for it on Riviera beaches in the 1960s, topless sunbathing on the Côte d’Azur has occupied a rather romantic place in the Anglo-Saxon cultural mindset, tinged with nostalgia for the iconography of the sexual liberation movement. For me and other women growing up in a culture of British discomfort with all things bodily, these confident French women in Cannes or St Tropez seemed glamorous and worldly.A teenage obsession with French cinema helped me to discover the work of François Ozon in Swimming Pool, Luine Sagnier is famously topless or naked for more than half the film. At the time I treated such nudity with deference: it was culture, it bore no relation to the tabloid posing of glamour models. It was, I thought, cool.But times have changed: the porn industry, rampant in the digital age, has seen female objectification ratcheted up to such a degree that removing your bikini top to avoid tan lines on a public beach has come to seem risky for more and more younger women.I was in my early 20s when I first sunbathed topless. “There’s nothing like the feeling of sun on your tits,” a Polish friend said as she stripped off on a beach in Sardinia, unfazed by the company of guys we had only just met. I joined her. A lack of typically English hang-ups probably played a part in her confidence the existence of breasts were a simple unremarkable fact to her. She wasn’t weighed down by cultural and sexist baggage. In that she shares her attitude with members of the Swedish feminist organisation Bara Bröst, who asked, eminently reasonably, why women should be forced to cover up in public pools when men need not (they successfully campaigned to change the rules in Malmo in 2009). After all, the chair of the city’s sports and recreation committee wryly noted, “many men have larger breasts than women”. More recently, women in Munich demanded “topfreedom” – as the cultural and political movement is called – during the recent heatwave after they were asked to cover up. Their request has been granted: swimwear now must only “completely cover the primary reproductive organs”.Since that first experience in Sardinia in my early 20s, I have sunbathed topless in Barcelona and the Cyclades, southern Italy and even Cannes (it is true that it seemed to be mostly older women doing it on the French Riviera). Crucially, I have always been accompanied, often by my husband, so have felt more protected from harassment.The place my friends and I indulge most frequently is the Ladies’ Pond on Hampstead Heath, where on sunny days you’ll find the attractive pondside meadow crowded with women of all ages and demographics. I’ve often thought that, were I an impressionist artist, this is the scene that I would paint. A Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe for the 21st century, which, instead of showing one nude woman accompanied by two fully dressed men, as Édouard Manet’s painting does, would be crowded with cheerful, sun-seeking bare-breasted women, no men to be seen. In At the Pond, a wonderful new essay collection published by Daunt Books, women writers reflect on what this very special place means to them. Lou Stoppard writes: “If men could see this they would correctly call it paradise. Is this what they imagine women do when they hang out together: sit topless, hair dripping, smoking a cigarette, reading the newspaper, eating leftovers from a Tupperware, momentarily unbothered by stares or comments.”“I suppose the appeal of the pond is having a moment’s peace, away from prying eyes,” Stoppard tells me. “Often, particularly in a big city like London, one feels looked at, or like a piece of public property – there to be regarded, judged or commented on.” Perhaps, in the #MeToo era, and judging by the evidence of that French survey, many more such spaces are needed. Naturists in Paris complained recently of “perverts hiding in bushes” and there is no shortage of men who regard women’s bodies as public property to be recorded for their own gratification. So I do not blame young women for covering up. I am in my 30s now, afforded a certain amount of invisibility. They are not.When I first saw Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe, it suggested a disquieting power dynamic. But the woman stares out at the viewer with a strong, confident gaze. She is unashamed, brazen, both looking and looked at. The power dynamics that today’s young women are negotiating seem no less ambiguous.• Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a  columnist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d03c4dd8f158f5b71007f48a6011380165fc8b7d/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9134cc87b33a3c926f1669a82fac8150","title":"overseas students face unacceptable visa costs after outsourcing","story":"Universities fear chaos in September as private company struggles with workloadInternational students and staff at British universities are facing “unacceptable” difficulties and costs in applying for visas, after parts of the application process were outsourced to a company charging up to £200 for appointments.Universities say that the system, run by the French IT services company Sopra Steria, is already struggling to cope with the numbers renewing their student visas within the UK, and fear that it will be chaotic in September when more than 40,000 students are expected to use it.“Despite constructive engagement between the Home Office, UK Visas and Immigration and universities, the current capacity and level of service being offered by Sopra Steria remains unacceptable,” said Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK.“Students and universities cannot be expected to pay to address Sopra Steria’s broken system. We are calling on Sopra Steria to fully address these concerns before the September surge of students so that students can start their courses with the visas they need.”Until March applicants were able to use a service provided through post offices to check documents and provide biometric information such as photographs. But since then they must book appointments through six Sopra Steria-run centres around the UK or pay extra for appointments in other cities.Universities UK, which represents more than 130 British higher education institutions, has received a stream of complaints about Sopra Steria from its members, and from students unable to book free appointments required to scan documents and take fingerprints.Sopra Steria offers “enhanced” appointments at its main offices for extra fees, including next-day or emergency appointments from £100 to £200. Appointments can be made online, or through the company’s phone line which costs £2.50 a minute. The company’s website also offers appointments at a “premium lounge” in the City of London starting at £200, “for customers who desire a service with added comfort and privacy”.Those costs are on top of the £475 that international students typically pay for a tier 4 visa application, and £300 a year surcharge for use of the NHS.Elisa Calcagni, a student from Chile studying for a doctorate at the University of Cambridge, said: “I was required to enrol my biometrics through Sopra Steria. I had not expected any additional charges but I found it virtually impossible to find a free appointment.“The time window for bookings on the online system only covers two weeks and there were no free appointments available, or any appointments at all in Cambridge. I called the Sopra Steria support line and they suggested to keep checking the website for cancelled appointments.“I didn’t want the uncertainty of constantly checking the system with no guarantee of an appointment becoming available, so I elected to pay £100 for an appointment in Croydon, two hours away. Despite booking a timed appointment, there was a waiting time of an hour and then the system wasn’t working properly leading to further delays.”Free appointments are said to be between 10am and 4pm at the company’s core centres, in Birmingham, Belfast, Cardiff, Croydon in south London, Glasgow and Manchester. In some other cities “enhanced service points” offer appointments for £60 to £125, in many cases located in public libraries.“As a result, some students are paying to fast-track their appointments and travelling to one of Sopra Steria’s centres, often many miles away from where they live,” Universities UK said.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the “shoddy” service was the wrong way to treat students making significant educational and financial contributions to the UK.“While other countries are falling over themselves to attract international students, this Tory government continues to subject them to a hostile environment,” Abbott said.“Sopra Steria are yet another private contractor, like G4S and Serco, given millions in public funds by the Home Office, and providing a shoddy service.”A spokesperson for the company said: “Sopra Steria is working closely with the Home Office, universities and higher education institutions across the UK to deliver the tier 4 visa application service. This is tailored to each institution’s needs to provide greater student convenience and choice.“We are focused on adapting the service to respond to areas of greatest demand and are increasing capacity where needed.”Other students have also said they couldn’t access online appointments administered by Sopra Steria. Khalid Elkhereiji, a student at the University of Southampton who uses a screen reader to read onscreen text aloud, said it could not deal with parts of the online application.“This is not a problem that I face with other websites and it meant I was not able to log in without the assistance of a sighted person,” Elkhereiji said.“I have explained my concerns with the accessibility of the service to Sopra Steria and I believe it is a relatively simple issue to fix. However, I have not had any further updates from Sopra Steria and there has been no confirmation that their website is inclusive and accessible to everyone.”After eventually logging on Elkhereiji found there were no appointments available in Southampton, and obtained one only after his university intervened.In 2017 Sopra Steria came under fire for its involvement in NHS Shared Business Services (SBS), a venture it co-owned with the Department of Health, after the  revealed that more than 500,000 pieces of sensitive medical correspondence handled by SBS had gone missing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef261702cbd907fff3944fea219149cd16bd3e8c/0_384_5761_3457/master/5761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d781e94fea98c49de9326c0e0e627eb","title":"international incident work mistake official secrets film","story":"It was the Observer’s big scoop of 2003, and as a young journalist, I was asked to type up a top-secret memo. Now my mess-up has made it to the big screenHave you ever wondered who’d play you in a film? I had, occasionally, until the day I got the answer. In spring 2018, a message pinged on to my phone via Facebook from a journalist friend. “So this is a bit weird,” it read. “A sister of a friend is playing you in a movie, apparently. You aware of this?” I wasn’t.“Hanako Footman is playing you in the film Official Secrets. She wants to meet you, like actors do. She saw we were pals and asked if I’d ask you. What did you do in that story?”“That story” concerns British whistleblower Katharine Gun, played by Keira Knightley in a film that premiered at Sundance festival in January. Fluent in Mandarin, the 28-year-old Gun was employed as a translator at GCHQ in Cheltenham. In 2003, she leaked a top-secret memo to the Observer about an illegal spying operation ordered by the US National Security Agency. It intended to bug the phones and emails of six United Nations delegates, from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea and Pakistan – nations that could determine whether the UN approved the invasion of Iraq.The memo, which outraged Gun, ordered staff to increase surveillance operations “particularly directed at… UN Security Council members (minus US and GBR, of course)” to provide real-time intelligence for Bush officials on voting intentions. I was working at the Observer at the time. And, although I was just a bit-player in the story, the film dramatises a monumental mess-up on my behalf – the biggest mistake of my career.It’s 2003. The airwaves are filled with Beyoncé’s Crazy In Love, Justin Timberlake’s Cry Me A River and Hey Ya! by OutKast. Cool young things wear absurdly small clothing – low-slung jeans nicknamed “bumsters”, for obvious reasons thongs crop tops and, most ill-advisedly, “shrugs”, unflattering miniature cardigans. An incredible heatwave sweeps Europe, too, with the mercury hitting 38.5C in Brogdale, Kent.The feverishness of those days extends to geopolitics. Three years earlier, George W Bush narrowly won the 2000 US presidential election after a recount in Florida and a debacle involving hanging chads. In 2001 came the terrorist attacks of 911, propelling al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden into the public consciousness. Britain’s “special relationship” with the US grew ever closer, thanks to the manoeuvrings of the then prime minister, Tony Blair.It was an interesting time for a young journalist with no newspaper experience to be joining the foreign desk of the Observer. Aged 24 and having held only junior positions at women’s magazines, I applied for the role of foreign desk assistant in late 2002. State-schooled in Sussex and with no newspaper contacts, I had a thirst for foreign news. As a teenager, my heroes had been foreign correspondents Kate Adie, Michael Buerk and John Simpson. At university I devoured the works of George Orwell – himself a former Observer journalist – Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn and Graham Greene, before devoting a year of my degree to the impact of reporting on the Vietnam war. What I offered in keenness must have made up for my lack of experience because, after two interviews, I took a call and was told: “You’ve got the job… if you want it?” Of course I did.Joining was a culture shock. Our working week ran from Tuesday to Saturday, with knocking-off times getting progressively later (9, 10, 11pm) as Sunday approached. Everyone was constantly available on their BlackBerry – the height of tech at the time. The neighbouring Coach \u0026amp Horses pub was our unofficial canteen. My colleagues were impressive: charismatic raconteurs, supremely well-read and worldly wise. I was entrusted with an A4 contacts book – a ringbinder of phone and satellite phone numbers and emails for correspondents all over the globe. Dusty reporters would fly in from assignments in far-flung places, handing over a bundle of disorganised receipts for obscure items: four camels, for instance, “replacements for a herd accidentally hit and killed on a road by driver”.It was intense, collegiate and fun, and I felt privileged to be part of the team – but also out of my depth. My brilliant predecessor had left to make documentaries for Channel 4. I set about looking after flak jackets and foreign currency, visas and travel plans. I called to check in with reporters on high-risk assignments and watched the international news wires for stories. Not long after I started, I was asked to look into flights for a foreign correspondent to go from London to Diyarbakir and then help find a fixer to assist with crossing a border. I didn’t even know which country that was, let alone which border they might be crossing.Towards the end of my second week, I was handed a printout of an email by Martin Bright (then the Observer’s home affairs editor, played in Official Secrets by Matt Smith) and Peter Beaumont (the foreign affairs editor – played by Matthew Goode). Could I type it up and save it into the system? I wasn’t given any other information. Their only instruction: “Don’t make any mistakes.” And so I set to painstakingly typing in each sentence.Importance HIGHTop SecretAllAs you’ve likely heard by now, the Agency is mounting a surge…… We’d appreciate your support in getting the word to your analysts who might have similar, more in-direct access to valuable information from accesses in your product lines.It took about 10 minutes. I double-checked it, sent it through, moved on to my next task.On Sunday morning, I woke up to see the paper’s front-page splash: “Revealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war”. Underneath was the memo I’d typed up.Of course, the story – broken by Bright, Beaumont and the inimitable New York correspondent and investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy (played with great aplomb and accuracy in the film by Rhys Ifans) – was huge. But my pride in being a tiny part of the team soon crumbled when, first thing on Monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unknown number and, as Monday was a day off for most of the news team, I didn’t expect it to be the office. It was – I think – Stephen Pritchard, the paper’s readers’ editor. He was very polite, but informed me with deft understatement and a total lack of drama that I had caused “something of an international incident”.Fastidiously typing in the memo, and not knowing what the document was or its origins, I’d changed all the American spelling “mistakes” to British English. “Recognize” became recognise, and “emphasize” emphasise. “Favorable” was amended to favourable. I thought I was being helpful. Instead, it was a disaster.The story that Gun had risked so much to reveal was thrown into doubt. How could this be a leaked US memo, asked websites such as the Drudge Report, when it was all spelled in British English? The wobble caught on. Was it a fake? Some outlets due to report on the Observer’s story cancelled interviews over doubts about the memo’s authenticity. It was decided the readers’ editor should publish a special dispatch to counter the thousands of complaints from readers, many American, calling us “lying limey bastards”, claiming that the story’s authors had fallen victim to a hoax and that the email was part of a campaign of misinformation.Of course, it was not. Despite my “administrative error”, the story still made shockwaves around the world. Some days later, Gun went on to reveal her identity, and her life imploded she lost her job, was arrested and ultimately faced a trial under the Official Secrets Act, which collapsed after the prosecution declined to offer its evidence.Meanwhile, I struggled to make peace with the ramifications of what I’d done. Humiliated, and just a few weeks into my dream job, I rang my former magazine editor and asked for my old job back it had, of course, been filled.By Tuesday morning, there was nothing to do but go in and face the music. I assumed I’d be fired, and sobbed in the office loo before going to my desk. But while I am sure everyone involved was cursing my name – one of the biggest stories of their careers had been plunged into unnecessary doubt – they were outwardly kind and magnanimous. I was summoned to meet Pritchard and Bright to explain what had happened, and while there were a few eye rolls I think they understood why I’d done what I did, being in the dark about the genesis of the document. How the mistake wasn’t spotted by anyone else was also a matter of some consternation.Somehow, I managed to put the disaster behind me. The senior editors forgave me, and I remained on the foreign desk for three years.When, 16 years later, I found out that not only was the story being made into a film, but my mistake had been included, I had some sleepless nights. I met Footman, the young actor who plays me, at a cafe in London early last year with some trepidation. She told me she couldn’t ulge any specifics about the movie. “But is it made clear I wasn’t fired over what happened?” I asked. She was noncommittal, but said I did appear in a later scene. She wanted to talk details: what did I wear back in the day? What colour did I paint my fingernails? How did I get on with my colleagues? What were the foreign correspondents like? “Most of my outfits were probably too casual,” I said. “I was frequently hungover and more than once fell asleep in the canteen.” And how to describe the foreign correspondents? Simultaneously impressive and unpredictable.Around nine months after we met, I was invited to a first-cut screening of the film. I watched as “Nicole” got bawled out by the Observer’s famously sweary then editor, Roger Alton (played by Conleth Hill, Lord Varys in Game Of Thrones) in front of the entire team – thankfully not something that happened in real life. Footman played a blinder as me – albeit a more groomed version.I knew it would be hard to watch my mistake unfold, but when it came, it felt like being punched in the throat. I felt the shame all over again, and sobbed silently into my tissue. Nevertheless, the film is as brilliant as it is important. And while I wouldn’t recommend carrying the burden of a catastrophic fuck-up, as Alton would term it, through one’s career, it did provide a salutary lesson in attention to detail. It was my first serious mistake, and hopefully it will be my last.• Official Secrets is released in the UK on 18 OctoberIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/376c5b344aaba8ca3c18ff6cc4e34e9036baa040/0_1141_8000_4800/master/8000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9d004ac784b8771bc0bdd6162c62848","title":"sicilian salted ricotta and tomato salad recipe","story":"Whey is teased by artful Sicilian hands into traditional salted ricotta, never better than when enjoyed in this simple tomato saladLorena is lifting ricotta from the 150-litre pan in the corner of the room into small, perforated tubs. It’s 10am. She has been at the caseificio (dairy) since just after 5am, along with her nephew, Aurelio. It is July and a combination of dog-day Sicilian heat and lambing means there’s less milk. Today there was just shy of 100 litres, from sheep kept by Lorena’s husband a few miles outside the city. Most of the work has already been done the milk has been heated with salt and rennet and, thanks to the alchemy of coagulation, separated into curds and whey. The curds have been cut and pressed into forms, at which point they are called tuma. The remaining whey in the huge pan will be used to cook the forms of tuma for a few hours, after which they will be called primo sale (first salt), until they are old enough to be pecorino Siciliano.I arrive to see what Lorena, once a hospital lab technician but now reborn as a cheesemaker, refers to as the guadagno pulito – her clean earnings, the something-for-nothing – the ricotta. If you’ve ever seen whey, you will probably agree that it is pretty unpromising, yellow and thin. However, it has more to give. Before the tuma is cooked, more milk and rennet are added to the whey, and it is recooked or reheated, and soft white clots, given the same name as the process, ricotta, come to the surface. From seemingly nothing, to something so wobbly and good, which seems a miraculous thing.As the clots of ricotta bob on the surface, floating like fat clouds, Lorena uses a slotted spoon with a scooping sweep to lift the ricotta into the perforated plastic pots. She also lifts some ricotta into a traditional cane cavagna, the containers my Sicilian partner remembers from childhood. A man on a motorbike with the cones hanging from the sides would putt-putt down the street, while the kids would wait on doorsteps with plates to receive the contents.Technically not a cheese but a latticino (milk product), ricotta seems all the more precious because it is made from something that would otherwise be thrown away. While ricotta is made all over southern Italy, varying by place, regional preferences and the season, Sicilian ricotta is notable for its tender, wobbly texture when freshly made – somewhere between junket and just-set scrambled egg. It has a clean, creamy, sweet-but-savoury, and just-a-bit sheepish flavour.While I am at the caseificio, customers arrive asking if the ricotta is ready, the steam from the pot misting their specs and sunglasses. Older customers bring pans to collect their portions, with some asking for extra siero (whey), of which there is plenty still in the pan. One man tells us that he will treat it like a soup and dip bread in while watching his favourite soap opera. Beyond eating it as soon as possible with bread, local recipes for ricotta include a filling for ravioli or gnocchi, as part of baked pasta or impanata (filled bread), for cakes, cannoli, or in the various fried pastries that fill the counters.With its ephemeral wobble, fresh ricotta is not an enduring food, especially in summer, so people have found ways of preserving it by salting. Traditionally done at home in dark corners with trays of salt, salted ricotta is now made on both a small and large scale. Lorena shows me how to rub a three-day old ricotta with salt until it is encrusted. After this, it will take a month, a second salting and careful draining for 500g of fresh ricotta to shrink into a round, ricotta salata a quarter of its original size.The texture, too, is transformed – from soft to firm, and compact enough to be grated, or pared into crumbly-edged slices. Salting transforms the flavour, too: creamy and shy wobbles are given sharp, salty edges, with that sheepishness becoming more pronounced.Ricotta salata is essential for pasta alla norma and makes a brilliant grating cheese. It is also a natural partner for tomatoes – especially small and sweet cherry ones – and today’s salad. Halve 500g cherry tomatoes, finely slice a medium-sized red onion, drizzle with eight tablespoons of olive oil and grate over (or finely slice) 75g salted ricotta. It’s a favourite summer salad served alongside sausages or fish.While Lorena wraps my cone, we decide that, unlike its fresh form, ricotta salata is also a good traveller. Which, for those of us who don’t live opposite a Sicilian caseificio, can only be a good thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b545ce1211304146031054e978418f0e5d085e/0_44_5099_3059/master/5099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8e082d49e19e8e528a53bc6e6ed1cb8","title":"gareth bale upset florentino perez real madrid no way out china zidane","story":"• Bale’s move to China blocked by Madrid president• Player sees little prospect of being selected by ZidaneGareth Bale sees no way out of Real Madrid after the apparent collapse of his move to China, with the forward concluding that Florentino Pérez, the president, could not care less that Zinedine Zidane does not want to play him in the first team.Bale had been set to move to Jiangsu Suning in a deal worth around £1m a week. Yet three days before the Chinese Super League’s transfer window closes on Wednesday, Pérez decided against the move and Bale believes it is dead.This has left Bale upset with the president, and because the player is understood to have no interest in a move to another club in Europe, permanently or on loan, the 30-year-old faces a bleak future at Madrid.Bale believes he currently has little prospect of being selected, given Zidane’s recent public pronouncements that he wants the Welshman to leave and the breakdown of his relationship with the manager.Jiangsu on Monday signed the Croatian striker Ivan Santini from Anderlecht, leaving them with five foreign players.

Mané played in the Africa Cup of Nations final for Senegal 10 days ago.Only then, four days before the Premier League opener against Norwich at Anfield on Friday week, will Klopp have his full squad together again. It is a situation which adds fuel to his player burn-out argument.Liverpool conceded only 22 goals last season, one fewer than City, so he will not be anticipating frailty.Klopp won the Super Cup in Germany twice, in 2013 and 2014 – each time against Pep Guardiola’s Bayern Munich – but he was caustic about the importance of those games too: “In Germany I won it twice but nobody mentions it. The Super Cup – you win it, nobody cares you lose it and some care.”Reaction to Sunday’s outcome could be similar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10ebf62d3eb75f29af1c7592f3a93e36b6dc6627/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29142ff152335e96367765805c98aa7","title":"league two 2019 20 preview","story":"There is a vast pool of exciting 40-something coaches determined to make a splash as managers, some of whom are taking their first plunge while others, notably Paul Hurst, are hungry to kick on. Determined not to allow a 14-game reign at Ipswich define his reputation, Hurst has the look of a managerial catch for Scunthorpe United, given his success at Grimsby and Shrewsbury where he surpassed expectations, eking every sinew out of his players. At Glanford Park, however, Hurst will have to cope with the expectation that comes with the territory of being fancied for an instant return to League One. The signing of Andy Butler, who started his career at the club, seems a sensible addition.After spectacularly stalling at the tail-end of last season, Mansfield Town will fancy their chances of going one better, with Nicky Maynard, who averaged a goal every 140 minutes at Bury last season, a superb free transfer, though the video that accompanied confirmation of his arrival made excruciating viewing. Bradford City, too, should be in the mix under Gary Bowyer the former Everton striker James Vaughan, who has been given the captain’s armband, and Clayton Donaldson will cause defences problems, but it was picking the ball out of their own net that was a recurring theme last season.Mark Cooper’s Forest Green Rovers almost snuck into the automatic places in May and, despite losing in the play-off semi-finals, they will expect to go close once more having made huge strides in three years under Cooper. Losing Christian Doidge and Reece Brown was a big yet unsurprising blow and Rovers have recruited smartly, with Matt Mills, formerly of Nottingham Forest, joining his younger brother Joseph at the club. Up the M5, it would be a surprise if a new-look Walsall were not in the reckoning under Darrell Clarke, while Richie Wellens can send Swindon close in his first full season Zeki Fryers, formerly of Manchester United, is an eye-catching signing.Exeter City will be expected to challenge after falling short last season and Matt Taylor has freshened up his squad with nine new faces, including the former Reading goalkeeper Lewis Ward and forward Nicky Ajose. Mike Flynn worked wonders to guide Newport County into the play-offs on the back of another fine FA Cup run last season but repeating that feat looks a tall order.Salford City have grand plans but a fifth promotion in six seasons may prove too big an ask. The former Burnley defender Graham Alexander continues to be handsomely backed by the Singaporean billionaire Peter Lim and the ‘Class of 92’, with Richie Towell, who featured for Rotherham in the Championship last season, an eye-catching signing from Brighton, but whether they can topple the top seven remains to be seen. Stevenage could be dark horses under Dino Maamria, if they can start where they left off last season. If new signings gel with a youthful group – Luther Wildin, 21, and Arthur Iontton, 18, have shone – they could shake things up. The arrival of Jason Cowley is intriguing, with the striker signing from non-league Bromsgrove Sporting, for whom he scored 102 goals in 127 appearances.Thirteen successive seasons at this level is not to be sniffed at but Morecambe begin, as they do every season, up against it. By now, though, Jim Bentley, the longest-serving manager in the country at eight years and 78 days and counting, is used to the battle. Kevin Ellison will play on past his 41st birthday but Andy Fleming has been forced to retire aged 31, because of a serious knee injury. “He was the only outfield player still at the club since I played,” said Bentley, who has signed defender Tom Brewitt, who came through the youth ranks alongside close friend Harry Wilson at Liverpool.Laurent Banide worked with a baby-faced David Trezeguet and Thierry Henry at Monaco but after almost a decade working in the Far East, he becomes the 12th manager in four years at Oldham Athletic, where he has said his role does not include recruiting players. Paul Scholes lasted just 31 days and after another summer of sea change – including eight signings – it is impossible to predict the outcome of their latest experiment. Elsewhere, financial unrest still plagues Sol Campbell’s Macclesfield Town, while Gabriele Cioffi’s Crawley Town have work to do.Ryan Lowe endeared himself to supporters by bullishly telling them he has signed the “best No 10 in the league” in Mayor, insisting the former Bury midfielder, who won the League Two player of the year award last season, is better than Graham Carey and Ruben Lameiras, two former Devon darlings. A versatile winger, Mayor, like Lowe, is gunning for successive promotions.After a stint in Indonesia, the former Liverpool and Newcastle midfielder, who was born in Shrewsbury, has returned closer to home following a trial. The 32-year-old, who made more than 100 Premier League appearances, last played in England for Blackburn. “You need a good balance in League Two, plenty of energy and a bit of know-how,” said manager Darrell Clarke.The striker went from McDonald’s to Molineux in less than two years, earning a move to Wolves after impressing at Newport as a teenager but following his release in January, the 22-year-old had to rebuild his confidence. Collins impressed at Morecambe, scoring eight goals in 15 games to earn a summer move to a side serious about chasing promotion under Mark Cooper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a5fc3ef35314e72a76f6db9a098aa51a3781802/218_97_2310_1386/master/2310.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=190481d4b69d3dcbfe2256a260b7325f","title":"premier league 2019 20 preview arsenal unai emery champions league pepe","story":"The time for excuses is over. Emery must return Arsenal to the Champions League, and signing Pépé would be timely writers’ predicted position: 6th (NB: this is not necessarily Nick Ames’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 50-1It was still possible to believe Laurent Koscielny when, among the standard new-signing platitudes, he described Arsenal as “a reference for football”. It was July 2010 and they had just finished third in the Premier League, 11 points shy of champions Chelsea, but the afterglow of Arsène Wenger’s best days had not quite faded and the most fiscally painful moments of the heave into Emirates Stadium appeared to have passed. Two months later Ivan Gazidis, never shy to expound a grand vision during his time as chief executive, struck a similar note with regard to their off-field planning. “The game is increasingly looking towards Arsenal as a model of what a football club should be,” he said. “However, we have to keep moving forwards – standing still is never an option.”Presumably “lurching backwards” was not on his checklist either but Arsenal go into this season with their place among the ision’s elite looking no more secure than a year ago. A measure of how expectations have gradually slipped since those optimistic days at the decade’s turn is offered by the fact that, while they can rightly aim to overhaul at least one of Tottenham and Chelsea en route to a first top-four finish in four years, there is as much to concern them in the forms of Leicester, Wolves and Everton narrowing the gap below.Excuses have become a staple in their part of north London but, in one sense, those will run out this year. Unai Emery deserved a more or less free hit in 2018-19 and those spying an end to the retrograde trend will point out they finished one place and seven points better off than in Wenger’s farewell campaign. There were some punchier home performances and a run to the Europa League final, much as that ended ignominiously. But for a club that had been so rooted in his predecessor’s ideals it was hard, for much of the season, to define what Emery’s style was a fact not helped by his reluctance, either in Spanish or his stoic attempts at English, to offer inquisitors many morsels of explanation.The bottom line is that Emery must return Arsenal to the Champions League and, should he not manage it, the break clause in his contract will look tempting for all parties next summer. Received wisdom has been that he must do it with a hand tied behind his back so it was to some surprise when, over the weekend, news emerged that Lille had accepted their club record £72m offer for Nicolas Pépé. The Ivorian is an outstanding wide forward who scored 22 Ligue 1 goals last season if Napoli’s interest is dismissed then Arsenal will possess three prolific front men and again look like a club that can master the French market. It would be a bold, timely statement. There may not be much left in the budget after that although a move for Kieran Tierney, the impressive Celtic left-back, may eventually succeed.Getting Pépé over the line would boost morale but further changes are required. While bigger deals bubble away Emery has gone with the market he knows best – a trait that alienated Sven Mislintat, whose trumpeted but short-lived spell as head of recruitment ended in February – in loaning the 22-year-old Dani Ceballos from Real Madrid. It looks a smart move: Ceballos is a confident, spiky technician who will liven up a turgid midfield offering immeasurably if he settles quickly. The failure of last season’s experiment with Denis Suárez might then be consigned to memory, too.Two new 18-year-olds offer distinct promise and should, in time, help freshen up an ageing squad. Those who have watched Gabriel Martinelli, signed from the Brazilian club Ituano, suggest the forward is good enough to be spared the endless cycle of career-stalling loan moves commonly bestowed upon punts from South America. The arrival of William Saliba, an exceptionally promising defender from Saint-Étienne who will be loaned back to the Ligue 1 club, counts as a minor coup after he rejected interest from Tottenham. The slightest evidence of local supremacy is richly welcome these days. The striker Eddie Nketiah and midfielder Joe Willock, both academy products, impressed during a productive pre-season tour of the US and it would be no surprise if at least one of the pair were involved at Newcastle on the opening weekend.So the future could be in good hands, but Arsenal supporters have long been promised enough jam to decimate the country’s fruit farms. They hope a reconnection with the past will restore some balance. Freddie Ljungberg has been promoted to assistant first-team coach while Edu’s arrival as technical director is a canny move, and not only because the club would have benefited from such an appointment at any point in the last decade. He was a well-liked member of the Invincibles squad and has honed a reputation as a shrewd executive with Brazil. According to the head of football Raúl Sanllehí he is the “final and most important part of the jigsaw” in their football infrastructure and perhaps Arsenal finally have a backroom in place that would survive comings and goings in the dugout.An early item in Edu’s intray will be to help Emery deal with Koscielny, who wants a return to France. The captain is one of few at Arsenal to come out of the past nine years virtually unblemished so it was a surprise, and perhaps a reflection on the club’s management in recent years, that he felt moved to skip the trip across the Atlantic.Something has gone badly wrong somewhere and it presents an immediate headache for Emery, whose other centre-back options provoke grimaces and flashbacks to 21 April, when a disastrous performance from Shkodran Mustafi against Palace effectively relinquished Arsenal’s hold on a Champions League spot. He has two top-class strikers in Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, whose rapport brought 40 goals last season and bailed out a number of shapeless displays, and will have another go at energising Mesut Özil, who has shown enough recently to suggest his cause might not be lost. Arsenal can still blow moderate opponents away with that firepower but new defenders are required to give Emery a fighting chance.If the season starts badly then Emery may find himself insulated from the harshest broadsides. Most of Arsenal’s followers agree the now-departed Gazidis’s vision from 2010 has been compromised at a thousand cuts since Stan Kroenke took a controlling stake the following year. A group of 14 leading supporters’ groups and outlets wrote to express dismay at the club’s decline this month, calling out a lack of strategy and accountability in a barely precedented intervention. Unrest in the stands, which has flared up occasionally over the past two years but never on a sustained level, could become harder to ignore if the squad looks critically under-resourced in key areas early on.“It feels as though Arsenal is at a crossroads,” that statement read. Nobody would argue. If last season was accepted to be one of change, the coming nine months will be a battle to show that their longer-term transition into also-rans can finally be arrested."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29e2bdbd81f33a5fe1b21642ba990ab86cc54388/0_77_2297_1379/master/2297.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0ea56886a292b27fad046db7df9df97","title":"american teenager becomes first fortnite world cup champion kyle bugha giersdorf","story":"Sixteen-year-old Kyle ‘Bugha’ Giersdorf beat 99 other players at the Fortnite World Cup tournament in New YorkLast night, a US teenager who goes by the name Bugha – real name Kyle Giersdorf – became the Fortnite World Cup Champion. The 16-year-old beat 99 other players in the brightly coloured Battle Royale game, running, building and fighting his way to a $3m (£2.4m) victory.The competition began months ago, with waves of qualifiers being selected in weekly online play-ins. A total of 40 million people attempted to qualify for the World Cup, the first esports event of its kind for the mega-hit Fortnite, one of the world’s most popular video games. The 100 who made their way to New York this weekend represented 30 different countries.Once there, they faced off in six rounds of the game’s last-man standing battles, scoring points for eliminating others or staying alive for as long as possible. A pro player for the esports organisation Sentinels, which fields players in Hearthstone and Apex Legends tournaments as well as Fortnite, Bugha pulled ahead in the very first round, racking up nine eliminations and surviving all the other players.Though his performances in future rounds were less attention-grabbing, his consistency meant that he stayed in first place throughout. In the sixth and final round he stayed alive until the top 10, eventually falling, but already smiling because he knew no one could catch up to his points lead. He ended up with almost double the score of the second-place competitor.The American competitor described how he was feeling in a post-match interview. “I’m just so happy. Everything I’ve done, the grind, it’s all paid off.” His family was in the stadium to watch and congratulate him. So, too, were approximately 16,000 other attendees, with millions more tuning in online.Because each Fortnite match starts out with 100 players, they can be difficult to follow as precisely as more straightforward competitive games. Matches usually begin slowly as players drop on to their favourite spots on the map and gather materials, guns, and stranger additional items like a hamster wheel for quickly travelling around or a shadow bomb that makes you temporarily invisible.After a short time, a “storm” appears on the map, forcing players to move into a more condensed area. As the arena becomes smaller and smaller, the action ramps up, beginning with scraps between two people or small groups, and ending with an all-out brawl with dozens of competitors packed into a tiny space. When only two players remain, a tense 1:1 battle determines who will get the all-important victory royale.Many viewers of the Fortnite World Cup had favourite players that they supported throughout the tournament. The most popular competitor at the World Cup was likely Turner Ellis Tenney, better known as Tfue, who regularly broadcasts his matches to a dedicated community. Playing Fortnite is already his career, both as a competitive player in tournaments and as a streamer on Twitch, entertaining his fans on a daily basis.But many of the 100 competitors were ordinary teenagers, who practise on their home computers or consoles.Sixteen-year-old Bugha represents the average age of a competitor, while others, including fifth-place finalist Thiago “King” Lapp from Argentina, were as young as 13. They were competing for a slice of the World Cup’s $30m (£24m) prize pool, currently the biggest in esports history – and the same amount awarded to teams in the recent women’s football World Cup.One 15-year-old British player, Jaden Ashman, took home over £1m by placing second with his partner in the duos version of the competition on Saturday. He told the BBC that he would probably save half of it and put “quite a lot of it into a house and my family”.His mother admitted that she had been “quite against his gaming”. But with Ashman, King, Bugha, and others taking home life-changing amounts of money, and every competitor in the final 100 earning at least $50,000, it’s clear that professional gaming can be an incredibly lucrative career for those few who are lucky, talented, and hardworking enough to make it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0b9ded93cccfd18877ea03f9baccd68a467adfd/165_595_6915_4150/master/6915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c854e8d310fe1899d79d70c8b12634a","title":"eco friendly going green poor cost diary","story":"Politicians and corporations have placed the burden of environmental responsibility on the consumer – but how easy is it to go green when you’re barely getting by? How easy is it to go green, to make deliberate, eco-friendly choices when you’re barely getting by? Can you be green and poor, as I am?This is the question I have been pondering as politicians and corporations have placed the burden of environmental responsibility on the consumer: stop using plastic straws, carry reusable shopping bags, recycle everything.I live in an environmentally conscious place: a rural town with thriving local food businesses, a farmers’ market and many organic farms. But it’s also a small town in central Appalachia, in the poorest county in my state: Ohio. Many people here go hungry. They can’t afford food, let alone organic food. A gas station is the closest source of “groceries” for some people without cars. You can’t walk everywhere if you live in the country.For a week, I kept a diary with some of the choices I made toward being green.I make my son’s lunch for camp. I got rid of most plastic in the kitchen several years ago – I don’t buy disposable plastic bags, plastic wrap or plastic storage containers – but reusable cloth bags don’t hold much, and most don’t keep food from going stale, even for a few hours. There’s mold spotted on one of the cloth bags I take out of the drawer, even though I wash, bleach and dry them. Any disposable plastic bags I have – because my mom sends snacks in them for her grandson, for example – I wash and carefully dry.I bought my parents beeswax wrap, which I love: reusable, washable food wrap that molds around leftover food, using the heat of your hands, and recently my mom purchased paper and aluminum drinking straws. But it’s been a bit of a struggle to persuade the older members of family to make green choices: it’s new to them, and it seems like extra work, because it often is.My son, a rising third-grader, told me that his school can recycle cans only if the cans are totally empty. But there’s no place or opportunity to dump the liquid in the cafeteria, and he doesn’t have enough time in his 15- to 20-minute lunch period to drink a full can of seltzer or juice without chugging it and getting a stomachache. This was a source of anxiety for him, so I stopped packing cans.I feel that most parents are trying to do their best, despite our often-difficult circumstances in this region, but it’s hard to balance children’s needs, finances and eco-consciousness.It’s hot this summer, usually intense and early, even for swampy Appalachia. Camp is just a 10-minute drive away, but we couldn’t walk it in this heat and with an eight-year-old who is already not thrilled about going to camp so his single mother can work. The rain cools things off enough to open the windows.Today’s expenses: beeswax wrap, $18.99 for  three wrapsSo many of my decisions are made by time. There’s a bus station by my house, but the bus comes irregularly, and I only have so long before my son returns from his second day of camp, hungry and wanting dinner. I drive 10 minutes to the small Aldi.Shopping at a discount grocery like Aldi makes it difficult to meal prep because you can’t really plan on what’s going to be there. But when I was laid off from my full-time job in March, I swore I would primarily shop there, or a similarly priced store. Doing so has cut my grocery bill by at least $40 a week. I haven’t been able to find full-time work yet, and I get by with a lot of freelance writing and editing, which means I need to keep my grocery bill low.But Aldi doesn’t have everything I need, like breakfast burritos and tofu for my mostly vegetarian kid, so I have to hit Kroger, too. Fortunately it’s on the way back home. I’m not wasting gas, only time, but I do spend a lot of money for just a few items at Kroger: the eco-friendly dish soap that is not available at the discount store, the recycled paper towels.I spend $50 at Aldi for the bulk of our meals for the week. And I spend $59 at Kroger for just … things. I’d like to buy local meat – I feel it tastes better, has fewer hormones, and I like supporting local farmers – but to do so, I would have to go to yet another grocery store, this one clear across town. This third, smaller store has issues with shelf stability: items don’t sell quickly enough not to go bad sometimes.Often, I shop at the health food store. It’s expensive but locally-owned, and along with herbs and vitamins, they have organic food, frozen meat and vegetarian food. My son and I can walk there, and usually do. Just a few months ago, another, much bigger health and organic food store opened, which is even closer to our house. I’ve only been in the new store once. It looks like a mini Whole Foods and is priced as such. What this community needs isn’t another pricey organic food store I worry it could put the older, more established local health food store out of business, and it still doesn’t bring affordable, fresh produce to the people who need it most.I bring my own reusable bags to Aldi, which is a requirement and it helps – if you have to buy or bring shopping bags every time, you will remember to bring them. And I use another of my own bags at Kroger. After unpacking groceries, I return the bags to my car and keep them there.Today’s expenses: $59.28 at Kroger for 11 items, $50.06 at Aldi for 21 itemsMy son and I live alone in an old house, over a hundred years old, which I rent. As a renter, there isn’t a lot you can do. My house has new windows on the top story, but the original ones on the bottom, most of which don’t open. In the winter, I seal the windows to keep in heat, and seal the drafty kitchen door, closing it off for the season. I change the furnace filter regularly and have blackout drapes on many of the windows, which can help keep the house warm or cool.But in the summer, like in many old houses, the downstairs is OK and the upstairs sweltering, too hot to sleep. I have two window air-conditioning units, given to me used. I feel terrible about running them, but am forced to sometimes to escape the high humidity, and 90-plus degree heat we have had this spring and summer.One of my neighbors has a fantastic, almost full-roof display of solar panels, but she owns her home. I can see her panels glinting in the sun from my porch.Today’s expenses: blackout curtains, $34.95 for two furnace filter, $36 for twoI am someone who was raised in the country, and while I don’t think I ever really made it into the middle class as an adult, my circumstances certainly lessened when I became a single mother, then lessened again when I was laid off. For me, having a dishwasher would be a marker of success. I’m not there yet.I have thought about purchasing a standalone dishwasher, but our older kitchen is extremely small. I don’t have the counter space for a counter dishwasher. So, even though I have read a dishwasher can actually use less water, I have to wash dishes by hand.I wash all of our clothes in cold water in the washing machine. I don’t wash my own shirts or jeans every time I wear them, both to conserve water and electricity and to extend the longevity of clothes. But my son’s clothes, stained with mud, grass and paint, I have to wash often.I hang most of our wet clothes to dry, which is another time-suck and one of my least favorite chores, but prevents the energy usage of the dryer and keeps some shirts from shrinking.Today’s expenses: hand washing dishes: about 50 cents  a batch washing clothes in cold water: about $1.50 a loadMy son and I are traveling this weekend: flying, which is not an environmentally conscious thing to do. We don’t travel often, but this is a special, long-planned trip to visit family in Colorado, way too far to drive with a small child and my 18-year-old Honda. I would love to replace my car. I know a new model would be more gas efficient, but it’s not possible for me right now financially. A hybrid, or any new or used car, is simply out of my reach.One of the impacts of our current eco-consciousness is some people feeling bad for decisions largely out of their control – and many people not feeling bad for actions they can control. I feel guilty for flying to see loved ones. Do executives at Coca-Cola feel guilty for their massive plastic pollution?Somehow I doubt it.The inventor of Keurig K-Cups, a source of mounting plastic pollution, did publicly express remorse for his invention. I was gifted a Keurig coffee maker, but used the refillable attachment, putting in my own ground coffee rather than the plastic cups. When that coffee maker broke, I started using a simple French press.You can purchase carbon offsets to try to mitigate some of the environmental damage done by flying. The idea is to invest in green options, like wind farms. This is not something I have done before, and I have to admit, it’s a little overwhelming and confusing, especially as many carbon offset companies work directly with airlines and other corporations now.We’re taking a direct flight to Denver, which helps cut down on more unnecessary travel pollution, and we carpool to the airport. I bring empty reusable water bottles for myself and my son, and fill them up after security.I’m disappointed to see the recycling and trash cans at my airport look exactly the same: the recycling can is overflowing with trash. Some airlines mention, as the flight attendants collect items after the drink service, that they recycle those cans and little plastic cups. But do they?Today’s expenses: glass French press for coffee, $28.00I haven’t bought much new clothing for years. Part of that is out of necessity. Not only can I not afford it, I live in an area without many shopping options. We have a mall, but more storefronts are empty than occupied. The closest Target is across state lines. The biggest clothing retailer in my town is Goodwill, and all my friends and I shop there, and at other, local charity-based thrift shops.It’s normal in my town to wear used things – something I believe should be normalized everywhere: not to be sporting the latest trend, but to be wearing a piece that meant something to someone you know, that has a story or history. For an item to take up space in this rapidly filling world, it should really matter.It’s so typical to wear used clothes where I live that my friends and I hold clothing swap parties, where we bring bags of clothes that don’t fit any more or household items that we no longer need, and shop each others’ closets. Once, it would have mortified me to be out wearing a dress that a friend pointed to and said: that used to be mine. Now it’s a source of pride. Clothing connects us. It’s more than just fast fashion. That shirt brought me luck, someone said when I held up a red T-shirt at a clothing swap. Maybe it will bring you luck too.I didn’t buy anything new for my trip to Colorado. My sneakers are several years old. I wash them carefully, and replace the laces. I do have to buy new shoes for my son often, as kids grow quickly. I sometimes buy items from ThredUp, an online resale clothing shop, and I sell clothes to them as well, usually saving up credit for trade so I don’t have to spend a dime.In Colorado, after eating at a restaurant, I feel nervous asking for a box for leftovers, fearing the worst: Styrofoam. But at every restaurant in Colorado that we patronize, the carryout boxes are recycled or recyclable cardboard.I don’t think we talk enough about how the America consumer’s attempts to go green involve so much uncertainty and lack of agency. Starbucks, for example, gives me a plastic fork for a sandwich I order and certainly don’t need a fork to eat with. They don’t ask first if I want a fork, and should. I leave the fork unwrapped and give it back. But will they just throw it away?Small choices like this feel huge – but many of them aren’t even choices we as iniduals can make. I can’t bring my own takeout containers to local restaurants in Ohio – it’s a health hazard, according to the restaurants. On our Colorado trip, my mom was amazed at a store that sold soap and shampoo by the barrel – you bring your own containers to fill. There are no stores like that near me.There are no bins or instructions about recycling in the Airbnb we have rented. So we pitch all the empty cans, bottles and cardboard into a couple of grocery bags, and at the end of our trip, trek them back down the mountain to my boyfriend’s mother’s house in the city (sorry, Judy), where they can be recycled.Today’s expenses: a pair of kids sneakers, used, about $16 ($35-40 new)A couple of years ago, inspired by several classmates, my son decided he was going to go vegetarian. Recently, he has started eating some meat again: chicken fingers, pepperoni pizza, but for the most part, we only eat meat two or three times a week. This does a lot, both for health – my dad’s doctor commended my son for getting his grandpa to eat less meat, and my dad’s subsequent weight loss and lower cholesterol numbers – and for the environment.But eating vegetarian isn’t always easy, especially in rural Appalachia, and it isn’t always cost-efficient or healthy. Many of the meat substitutes I have bought my son – soy bacon, bean burgers – cost more than meat, and are much harder to find, requiring special trips.Which means more gas. And more time.Time is a resource, especially for women, people of color, people who are disabled and people who are poor, and to ignore the impact of time on environmental choices is to ignore the reality of many people’s lives. People have to work multiple jobs, have to travel for work or groceries, don’t have recycling available, don’t have enough childcare to spend precious hours hanging laundry or washing plastic bags.A lot of things aren’t easy in my Appalachian home: finding work, finding and affording a place to live. Why did we think being green would be any different?When it comes to the environment, I am not alone in feeling a prevailing sense of guilt and concern. I have felt this a lot of the time, since I was a child and first heard in school about the depletion of the ozone layer.We live in a time of such dread. We walk with and through dread constantly. Dread is our companion in 2019, and also the feeling of futility. So many news sites have tossed about data and studies on how long until we run this planet into the ground. The dates vary, but it’s not long. Not long at all. It’s overwhelming to think the burden of keeping the world alive rests on the shoulders of consumers. And frankly, it shouldn’t. Not entirely.People need help from the companies that got us into this mess in the first place with their products and pollution. People need incentives – but also, assistance on how to be green. You have to offer and clearly label recycling bins, for instance. Fresh, affordable produce needs to be available before we can focus on organic.In order for people to make eco-conscious choices, there has to be an eco-conscious choice available for them to make. For many places, especially in rural and impoverished America, those choices simply don’t exist, not yet.Today’s expenses: veggie hotdogs, $5.79 for  four"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fa385bea765299e54eb4db88662c459596fc594/0_187_4688_2813/master/4688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d21773c3a9959dfb51516aab258fcaa1","title":"how we met she gave me what i call the electric hug i felt my hair stand up","story":"Kate Minchin, 44, a writer, and Sue Stark, 58, who works for a solar energy company, live in New York. They met on an all-women motorcycle trip‘We got to the front of the pack and sped off,” says Kate. She and Sue had reached the highest point on one of the highest motorable roads in the world, in the Ladakh region of northern India, and were alone for the first time. “It’s a tough bike ride to do – it’s not just a gravel path, they are like boulders,” says Kate. “So the adrenaline was flowing, but I was also chuffed because I was on my own with Sue. I was like a teenager.”They had met at a hotel in Delhi 10 days earlier, in July 2015, where nine of them had gathered for an all-women motorcycle trip. Neither made much of an impression on each other – they just got on with the trip, riding all day and meeting at hotels and camps in the evening. It was in Leh, northern India, where they had stopped for a couple of days before the final, highest leg of the journey, that Sue and Kate got talking. “We had more time to hang out, have a beer, get to know each other,” says Kate. “That was the point at which I started to think: ‘Oh bugger, I think I fancy her.’” She laughs. “Sue was adventurous, keen on biking, gorgeous. Also, she can be a bit of a tough cookie, initially, and I like a bit of a challenge. I found that mysterious and appealing. When we started chatting, she was great fun.”Sue hadn’t thought of Kate in that way, except to mention to a single friend on the trip that Kate was also single and attractive. “She is adventurous, travel-loving, smart, and she has that wonderful British wit,” says Sue, who is from the US. “And I thought she was cute.”Although it was romantic up there on that road alone – they slid down snowbanks and threw snowballs at each other – Kate didn’t make a move. “I knew Sue was single, but she hadn’t given any indicators that she was looking for anyone, or interested in me. We had started to get on really well, but I assumed that those feelings were one-sided – and if they weren’t going to be reciprocated, I didn’t want to risk spoiling the trip.”A few days later, everyone was hugging goodbye at the hotel in Delhi. Kate says: “I stood next to her thinking: ‘That can’t be the last hug – I need to do that again.’”Sue continues: “I was about to walk out the door and she comes back over and gives me what I call the electric hug. I felt the hair stand up on my head. It was such an intimate moment that I looked around thinking: ‘Did anyone see that?’ I spent the entire trip back to the airport thinking: ‘Oh my God, I think I’m attracted to Kate and I left her in India.’”Sue headed back to the US and Kate came home to the UK. They messaged each other for a couple of weeks, then started video calling soon they were talking for several hours a day.In December 2015, Kate flew out to the US. “We’d already decided that we were going to give it a go at being a couple,” says Sue. When she picked up Kate at the airport, the feeling “was instant”, she says. Kate adds: “From that point on, it was perfect.” They had agreed that airport arrivals was not a suitably memorable place for their first kiss. “So we walked out to my car hand in hand,” Sue remembers. “And then I couldn’t wait any longer.”Kate stayed for nine days, then they began a two-year long-distance relationship, meeting up every eight weeks. When Kate left her job, she spent a couple of months in the US, where they got engaged, then applied for a visa. “After two years, I needed to know what was happening,” says Sue. “We needed to be together or starting the process of getting together, because it was just too hard.”Last year, they were married by one of the women on their motorcycle trip another friend from the trip was maid of honour, as was Sue’s adult daughter.

If you’re laid-back by nature you tend to breeze through things. If you’re not, you should work at becoming more relaxed.What simple skill do you think everyone should know?How to ride a bike safely on the road. Conversely, drivers should know how to respect vulnerable road users.And if you lived your adult life again, what would you do differently?I’d spend more quality time with friends and family than working long hours.What do you wish children understood about adults?I wish they appreciated how hard it is to relate to them sometimes. It’s not their fault or ours, but you tend to lose touch with your childhood the older you get and it can become difficult to understand each other.What do you wish you’d known growing up?When you’re young you don’t have much confidence. I wish I’d realised that appearing to be confident often makes people take you more seriously. How you engage with people really makes a huge difference.What’s your golden tip for how to breeze through life?If there’s something you want to do, don’t back out. People who are successful aren’t always the best at what they’re doing, they’re just the ones who push themselves. Don’t think about it, do it. It also helps to be optimistic and positive.What simple skill do you think everyone should know?I find anything to do with plumbing really complicated, but I recently learned how to bleed a radiator. Instead of sitting in a cold room for years I could have done something about it – so that’s a good skill to have.And if you lived your adult life again, what would you do differently?Before I had a family I had a lot of disposable income, but I didn’t save any of it. I wish I’d put some aside for later life.What do you wish children understood about adults?What gives you authority as an adult is that you’re regarded as omniscient, but it would be nice if children appreciated that you haven’t got the answer to everything.What do you wish you’d known growing up?The importance of learning. I treated education as a passive thing and assumed that other people who were clever were just naturally gifted – I didn’t appreciate the fact that you could educate and improve yourself.What’s your golden tip for how to breeze through life?Smile, be helpful and think of others. Because, as they say, what goes around comes around.What simple skill do you think everyone should know?Everyone should be able to recite a poem or sing a song from memory.And if you lived your adult life again, what would you do differently?I’m contented to have got to where I am. Maybe I should have speculated and I would live in a bigger house now, but I’m just not like that.What do you wish children understood about adults?I don’t think they have to understand adults – I certainly didn’t. Perhaps I still don’t. Adults shouldn’t lose sight of their inner child.Download the Meerkat app and use our Credit Card EligibilityCheck to find the right credit card to meet your needs.

Here, she shares how she stays on top of money, the mortgage and managing billsRuth Young, 26, is a marketing manager in Newbury, Berkshire. She bought her first home, a two-bedroom apartment at Newbury racecourse, through the national shared ownership scheme just over a year ago.I have a relaxed, yet healthy, approach to money. I know when to treat myself and when to be more frivolous, but I also know what I can afford and when I should put the debit card away. It hasn’t always been this way. A few years ago I was scared to even look at my bank balance and would try to avoid it at all costs, until I decided to get on top of things. Just knowing what my bank balance was has made a big difference.Until I bought my own place, I was a commitment-phobe when it came to my living situation. I travelled for nearly two years, lived at home for a while, rented a room with an ex-boyfriend, then rented a lovely two-bedroom apartment with a friend for nine months – until she decided to move in with a partner. Rather than carry on renting, I finally plucked up the courage to try and get on the property ladder and discovered that there were some shared ownership apartments coming up on the development where we lived.Now, my main monthly outgoings are my mortgage (for half my home), rent (on the other half) and a service charge. Bills – such as electricity, heating and water – also take up a large proportion of my expenditure, which I manage and pay for myself. Properly managing bills was one of the many things I was nervous about when buying my property. I avoided it at first, but then I realised that the longer I left it, the more expensive they were getting. It’s best to set payment plans up as soon as you move in, to make sure that outgoings are manageable and even throughout the year.Because I live in a new-build house on a new development, I’m limited in the suppliers that I can choose for electricity and heating, but I always make sure I’m on the most cost-effective tariff available. After bills, my money goes towards things such as wifi, Netflix, Amazon Prime, petrol and my mobile phone. Eating out and Asos are my two biggest non-necessities.I use several apps to simplify my money. I used to work with clients in the fintech industry and would always try to keep on top of new finance apps. I set up a Monzo account as soon as I heard of it (who can resist a shiny new card where you can categorise spending with emojis?). But it was also great to track my spending by category, set up budgets in the app, track against these and to be able to change my pin and block my card instantly.I’ve also recently stopped doing a weekly food shop, to save money. I live alone and often spontaneously see friends, family, and my boyfriend throughout the week in the evenings, so I used to end up wasting food and money with a weekly shop. I now only buy food when I know I’m going to be eating at home, which actually saves me money. I can’t be trusted in the aisles of Tesco alone! However, years of living with my cost-conscious parents means I’m good at turning off the heating and lights whenever I leave the house. I also love my smart meter, which sits in my kitchen and not only tells me the time that I’m making a cuppa in the evening, but also how much I’ve spent that day on electricity. It’s usually a good sign that I need to get out of the house if it ever goes over £1 in a day! I also swear by Giffgaff to keep my phone costs down.Living on your own comes with pressures, and managing a house and the bills that are associated with it can feel daunting. But if you take them in manageable steps and keep on top of your bank balance with what’s available – or not! – it can actually be really enjoyable.Download the Meerkat app and use our Credit Card EligibilityCheck to find the right credit card to meet your needs.

Here, she shares their budgeting dos and dont’s …Full-time hospital catering assistant Rachael Howe, 31, and her boyfriend, Pete Walch, an industrial chemist, have been together for three years. They live in a terraced house in Bolton with Rachael’s rescue cat, Winston.Generally, I have a cautious approach to spending money. I’m fortunate that Pete earns more than the minimum wage, so on the occasions where we’re faced with an unexpected expense, he kindly helps out where he can. I wouldn’t say we have a particularly frugal lifestyle, but I definitely try to be careful.I attempt to simplify my money as much as possible. I have a mobile banking app, which I love because it means I know exactly what’s going on with my account at any time. I keep my statements paperless so I’m not sifting through papers to track down transactions and if I have any expenditure that I can’t set up a direct debit for, I’ll either schedule the payment through my banking app or set a reminder on my phone for 48 hours before the payment is due, to remind myself so that I can avoid any late fees.Our main outgoings are rent, utility bills and food. Pete also runs a car, so expenses such as fuel and car maintenance are a fairly regular outgoing for him. I also set myself a weekly budget.I keep track of the hours that I work, round my hourly wage down to the nearest pound to roughly compensate for national insurance and tax and take off the cost of my main outgoings – rent, utility bills, phone bill, etc – then ide my remaining total by the number of weeks between pay days to give myself a ballpark figure. I usually err on the side of caution and reduce the weekly amount by £10 to £20 to give myself some emergency funds in case I need them, and so that I can hopefully accumulate some savings.I find that taking the time to write outgoings down in a notebook gives me more of an incentive to stick to my budget. For some reason, just working them out on a calculator without writing it down just doesn’t stick with me as well.We have also had a smart meter fitted recently and we switched our gas and electricity supplier a few months back, having compared several companies to work out who provided the best value for money. Simple things, such as turning lights off and half-filling the kettle when you’re only making a couple of coffees, all add up to us having cheaper bills.I have a few other regular routines to help me save money. The first is that I always put any loose change – smaller than 50p – from my purse into a money box when I get home. We also check the reduced sections of the supermarket for items we can either put straight into the freezer or use towards making a large batch of something that we then split into portions and freeze for a later date. We always make a meal plan at the weekend for the following week, so we know exactly what food we need to buy. I think it’s important to make a list before you go food shopping as well, and try not to deviate from it. Local markets can be a great way of getting the right amount of fruit and vegetables for you, rather than buying pre-packaged foods from a supermarket which can cost more money or mean that you waste more food. Also, never go food shopping when you’re hungry!If I was to give any advice to young couples who are setting up home, it would be to always try to plan ahead. By planning your meals and other purchases, such as clothing and even entertainment, you can save a fortune. Try not to buy “bargains” on impulse if they aren’t something you’ll definitely use. Keep an eye on your favourite retailers’ websites to check for upcoming sales, and most cinemas, pub chains and other entertainment businesses have offers that can help save you cash, especially if you’re going out with friends.Download the Meerkat app and use our Credit Card EligibilityCheck to find the right credit card to meet your needs.

But he made that intention explicit in his description of Des Canyons aux Étoiles …, his longest orchestral work, composed in the early 1970s. It was commissioned for the bicentennial of US independence, and inspired by the vast desert landscapes and night skies of the American south-west, and of Utah in particular.Along with the monumental piano cycle Catalogue d’Oiseaux, the 90-minute work is Messiaen’s most ambitious celebration of the natural world (“God’s creation”, to the devoutly Roman Catholic composer). Birds sing in all 12 movements of Des Canyons, many of them transcribed by the composer himself in the national parks of Utah, though songs from elsewhere in the world – the Sahara, Australia, Hawaii – are incorporated. The score was an obvious choice for a Proms season that takes threatened nature as one of its themes, and it got an evening to itself, played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sakari Oramo, with pianist Nicolas Hodges, horn player Martin Owen and percussionists David Hockings and Alex Neal as the soloists.Unlike some of Messiaen’s works, Des Canyons was not specifically written for a large, resonant performing space, but the Royal Albert Hall acoustic suited it well. The massive diatonic climax that ends the second of the three parts was easily accommodated silences were tinged with the dying echoes of the tuned percussion the tangles of wind lines, as in the ecstatic explosion of birdsong in the penultimate movement, were superbly defined.Interstellar Call, the solo-horn movement, which now seems an unlikely precursor to some of the instrumental solos in Stockhausen’s Licht cycle, was made into a masterly tour de force by Owen, just as Hodges was fearsomely authoritative in his two solo movements, both of them bird portraits. But under Oramo’s command, it was the variety and virtuoso flair of the orchestral writing that made the biggest impact. There may be moments that recall Messiaen’s earlier works – Turangalîla, Oiseaux Exotiques, Chronochromie – but there’s much more that remains thrillingly fresh and unlike anything else he ever wrote. As this performance reminded us, Des Canyons aux Étoiles … is one of his greatest achievements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57853e0caacbe23b933e88d9e6b791af5c807210/0_236_3607_2164/master/3607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=016b1441a167234b667477af33401c27","title":"y not festival review pikehall derbyshire","story":"Pikehall, DerbyshireActs like Wolf Alice are a welcome break from the hordes of white blokes with guitars, who don’t reflect the eclectic taste of the crowd‘Y Not festival. Why not go home when it’s fucking thrashing down?” asks Shaun Ryder during the Happy Mondays’ Sunday afternoon set, as freezing cold rain batters the audience. Although a huge chunk of them already have, driven home by nonstop rain and a site turned to brown sludge.Located in the beautiful Peak District and one of the fastest-growing festivals in the UK, Y Not has an unusual demographic that is almost a perfect split between teenagers and over-40s. It’s a ide that Sports Team notice, as one half of the crowd bounce along in sweat-drenched clusters while the other nods reservedly. “Is this the parents’ side?” asks singer Alex Rice. “How’s the craft beer tent? Sorry Idles couldn’t be here.” However, this attempt at caustic wit quickly stumbles as the band immediately mess up new single Here It Comes Again and have to start over. It also doesn’t help that it sounds like past-their-best Art Brut.Idles do indeed turn up the next day and play an impassioned set, one that gains a sad relevance when singer Joe Talbot introduces a song about depression, 1049 Gotho, having just found out a friend took their own life. Some accuse them of mere sloganeering, but it’s a spiriting thing to witness a band with an audience as large as theirs declare, “Long live the European Union and immigration”, to a cross-generational audience united in the pit.Indie dominates Y Not. It’s a bit like being tuned into Steve Lamacq’s 6 Music programme for three days solid: a haven for some, but eclecticism suffers. One of the mid-2000s indie boom acts to come out of that era with memorable tunes, a shred of dignity and free from a crippling drug addiction is Franz Ferdinand. They play a brilliantly fun, punchy, at times almost cheesy set, with frontman Alex Kapranos playing the role of suited compere.This is the frustrating dichotomy of Y Not: it has done a brilliant job of attracting a huge number of engaged young people, but the lineup fails to reflect their post-genre sensibilities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8800782287458cbc0cc3b258f04671b06b465a70/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a49e66ee70820d279abf08520660bb0","title":"amazon 25 powerful jeff bezos podcast","story":"In 1994, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, the company that has since made him the richest man in the world.

While many readers were hopeful for an invigorated movement, others can’t forget the party’s involvement in the coalition and its support for austerity and other policies when in government. Below is a selection of your views.The Lib Dems are in the most promising position they have been in years, but they’ll have to resist the urge to rely on their anti-Brexit USP to win back disaffected ex-voters like myself. I would have to see a huge white flag in respect of their role in austerity, and a comprehensive set of ambitious policies to address inequality and environmental catastrophe. I switched my vote to Labour after the Lib Dems seemed to drink too much of the neoliberalausterity Kool-Aid in coalition with the Conservatives.Jo Swinson has energy, youthfulness and goodwill in her favour. She does not have a convincing record of progressive voting. I’d be willing to let sleeping dogs lie with regards to the coalition missteps if they come out strongly in favour of truly progressive economic and environmental policies. James, 27, LondonI was a paid-up member of the party from 2010-2017 but couldn’t vote for Tim Farron due to his equivocation over gay sex as a sin. Jo Swinson is a brilliant force for change. She’s intelligent, articulate and experienced for someone who’s yet to turn 40. She will challenge both Boris Johnson’s bluffing buffoonery and Jeremy Corbyn’s hard-left idealism. With her at the helm there is genuine hope for a new liberal movement to rise again in the UK. For a younger woman to strike out and offer a new path to follow will give great success to the party, as it did in New Zealand with Jacinda Ardern and in New York with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. These people are the caring future of our politics and I’ve no doubt Swinson will quickly develop a larger supporter base in the UK. Tom Williams, 41, LeicesterSwinson’s voting record is far too problematic for me ever to consider voting Lib Dem again. I regard the Lib Dems as Jekyll to the Tories’ Hyde. By becoming a single-issue “stop Brexit” party, they risk consigning themselves to irrelevance once again, since it’s highly unlikely that Johnson will call another referendum or unilaterally revoke article 50. A shift towards the Greens might be helpful, but I can’t see Swinson being too enthusiastic about that given her voting record. There’s a reason why she’s publicly courting disenchanted Tories they have very similar politics and ideology. Chris Hughes, 41, East AngliaI still have a lingering feeling of betrayal after their actions in the coalition government. As a regular undecided voter however, many of their policies meet my desires. Remain, support for education, higher taxes to pay for public services. I don’t feel I can vote Labour under Corbyn, so it’s Lib Dem or Green now. Fingers crossed Swinson can start to make me believe again. They need to remain a strong voice for a second referendum, but also ensure they have believable policies in other areas too. I suspect they will end up kingmakers again, let’s hope they act with more integrity next time. Andrea Hales, 44, WorcestershireIt’s about time we forgave them their errors in coalition. It’s not as if the Conservatives or Labour have not broken promises or made a total hash of stuff in the past. They are the only middle ground party and the only ones committed to electoral reform. I would personally vote Green but the only way to do that effectively is to edge towards PR. They need to hold the balance of power at the very least. Currently there is no effective opposition to anything. Steve, 61, KentI think the party has been unfairly punished for the worst decisions of the coalition. I hope that the party can be a beacon of hope in a world of increasingly extremist and uninformed views. I hope the party will be able to capitalise on the anti-Brexit feeling among large parts of the population and lead through the middle, growing its support base and number of MPs in any future election. I voted for Swinson because she is young, fresh, passionate, intelligent, articulate and speaks with authority on a range of topics. I think she can lead the party out of its recent difficult past. Fiona Sweetman, 53, CarlisleI think there is a huge chasm in politics at the moment and I feel there is great potential for the Liberal Democrats to fill that void. However, splitting the vote of remain-leaning or left-leaning parties is a problem. The Lib Dems need to manage their image and not be seen as a dumping ground for washed-up Tories and Blairites. I hope I am not alone in my belief that most who are anti-Brexit or centre-left see the benefit of the Lib Dems attracting votes that would otherwise go to the Conservatives. I feel the best hope for the party (and country) is to force a coalition government with Labour. Rob, 26, West MidlandsWhile I understand Brexit is the defining issue of our age, it cannot be a one-issue party. In the short term this may win it some success, but there needs to be longer-term policy planning and a seismic shift in how it projects itself and how it is perceived for it to remain a lasting political force.I was pleased by Jo Swinson’s election as leader in spite of her role in enabling Conservative austerity during the coalition government. But I was disconcerted by her statements in the press saying that she would rule out a Lib Dem pact with Labour under  Corbyn. Who is she appealing to by making this assertion? By denouncing Corbyn’s Labour, Swinson is effectively alienating millions of young voters who swung to Labour in 2017 because of Corbyn and because of his engaging social democratic brand of politics.

The police officer looks at me knowingly: “She’s unmanageable, this one.”Honestly, I’m nervous. I’ve been told this 19-year-old woman handed herself in to the police in fear of her life, thinking that she’d be killed or hurt by a local gang. She’s “uncooperative” and “out of control” and they need assistance working with her. I walk into the cell. “What do you want?” she shouts. I introduce myself as a social worker and tell her: “I don’t want anything from you. But I’m wondering what is it you want. So I know this may be a strange question to ask right now, but what might be your best hopes from us working together?”She stops and turns to look at me, suddenly seeming so much younger: “My best hope is that someone asks me how I am.”Cass is flustered, nervous and 20 minutes late. “I’m so sorry, I only slept one hour last night. Is this going to count against me?” Her ex-partner is a known gang member recently charged with modern-day slavery offences, drug and child trafficking. She has experienced severe domestic violence at his hands and lives with depression, nightmares and anxiety, while her child is currently subject to care proceedings.“What does it say about you as a person, Cass, that despite only having slept for one hour you’ve still been able to get out of bed and make it here to see me?” Cass looks lost for words and I’m trying really hard not to fill the silence. I hand her a bright pink sticky note and a felt tip pen, hoping it may help.Cass takes it and writes “STRONG” in big capital letters. She smiles and mutters: “God I never thought about it like this before. I never realised how determined I am.”No sessions today. I’m tired and secretly relieved.This is the sixth time Lucy has missed her session, and the sixth time I’ve made the two-hour journey to see her. I’m starting to feel like an unwanted therapy delivery service and wondering why the hell I do this to myself when suddenly I see her walking tentatively up to reception. I’m over the moon and I can’t hide it. “Don’t look too surprised to see me, then,” she jokes.I ask her why, after all this time, has she finally decided to turn up? “I was just testing you. I wanted to see if you were going to give up and leave me like everyone always does. Shall we make a start?” I remind her she never has to tell me anything she doesn’t want to, that this is her space and what she shares is her choice. She looks at me cautiously. She then tells me how she was raped by her father. Rejected by her family. Placed in care.

It was set up in 2016 to develop a new way of measuring poverty.The finding echoes wider concerns about the re-emergence of extreme poverty, known as destitution, which separate research has shown was experienced by an estimated 1.5 million people in the UK as a result of benefits cuts and high rents. A destitution level of income is £140 a week for a couple with two children.Although overall rates of poverty have changed relatively little since 2000-01, certain groups – such as children, children of lone parents, and pensioners – have had hardship levels rise since 2013 as a result of austerity measures such as the benefit freeze, reversing earlier downward trends, the commission said.The commission’s report confirms that disability is one of the strongest predictors of being in poverty. Nearly half of all those living below the breadline live in a household where someone is disabled.Since the commission published its first report last year, the government has announced it will develop experimental national statistics based on its approach, indicating possible adoption as an official poverty measure. Its data was used by the UN rapporteur, Philip Alston, in his recent UK poverty report.A government spokesperson said: “Tackling poverty will always be a priority for this government. We want to build on our progress to ensure every family can thrive. That’s why we’ve raised the personal allowance to take 1.74 million of the lowest paid out of income tax altogether and increased the national living wage to provide the biggest pay rise for low-paid workers in 20 years.”Helen Barnard, a commission member and poverty expert at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “We need our new prime minister to get to work immediately on a bold plan to boost living standards and support our towns and cities in building a more hopeful economic future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68f97547f8700d2edfb682b66cfd3a385afd091c/0_346_5193_3116/master/5193.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=283882899969e54f6889ad3ea054946b","title":"egan bernal tour de france winner colombia","story":"Geraint Thomas says his teammate could be ‘one of the greatest ever’ and Dave Brailsford calls him ‘the new Chris Froome’Egan Bernal’s first bicycle was yellow, a prescient choice given he has become the first Colombian, and one of the youngest riders in history, to win the maillot jaune in the Tour de France.The story of the 22-year-old’s win is the chronicle of a victory foretold, in which the defending champion, Geraint Thomas, was always likely to be second best.As early as stage three to Épernay, Bernal was straining at the leash, tempted to shatter his team’s meticulous hierarchy by following Julian Alaphilippe as he attacked on the appropriately named Cote de Mutigny.Instead, Bernal sat tight for another two weeks, until the climactic and chaotic Alpine stages, before finally unleashing the devastating climbing speed that reduced his rivals, and his teammate Thomas, to helpless spectators. His ascent of the Col de l’Iseran revealed with blinding clarity who was the best mountain goat in what the race organisers billed as the highest Tour.Despite the speculation that their dual leadership would lead to a repeat of the tensions that characterised Bradley Wiggins’s relationship with Chris Froome, there was little sign of any rancour throughout the Tour, and Thomas was crestfallen and gracious in defeat.“He’s a pleasure to ride with,” Thomas said. “I don’t want to put pressure on the lad but he’s 22, he’s got 10 years in front of him, he could become one of the greatest ever. Froome is probably the best Grand Tour rider at the moment with his record and consistency but I think Egan can be just as good, or even improve.”In keeping with that statement, the Ineos chief, Dave Brailsford, had already described Bernal as “the new Chris Froome”.“The harder the race gets, the better he gets,” he said. “I think that’s why as a Grand Tour contender now and in the future, the ability to resist fatigue is one of his greatest strengths.”Bernal’s all-round ability, fuelled by his father’s love of cycling and founded in mountain biking, was further honed in Italian racing with the lowly Androni Giacottoli team, managed by renowned talent spotter Gianni Savio. It has now been further enhanced at Ineos, with whom he has a five-year contract.“At 33, 34, Geraint and Chris are coming to the twilight of their careers,” Brailsford said. “I wanted a new Chris Froome, basically. So I set myself the challenge of finding him. I took two years looking at all the younger riders and liked the look of Egan. I had to wait a year and then managed to negotiate him out of his contract.”Brailsford’s insatiable appetite for success, that only a few months ago appeared stymied after Sky pulled their sponsorship, has taken another leap forward.“This is the moment that could make Colombia one of the greatest cycling nations in the world,” he said. “Colombia could be to cycling what Brazil is to football. This victory can help make that happen.”His youth policy, which also includes Tao Geoghegan Hart, Tom Pidcock, Pavel Sivakov, Eddie Dunbar and Ruben Sosa, seems certain to continue the production line of Grand Tour success that has been so lauded and also so controversial.“We focused on recruiting a team of ‘young guns,’ many of whom rode the Giro this year, and it’s exciting to help them develop and grow whilst also having the A team continuing to push their performance at the highest level.”He has now added even more Latin talent to his roster by luring the recent Giro d’Italia winner, Richard Carapaz, to Ineos. The signing is expected to be confirmed next week, when the Ecuadorian joins a team overflowing with stage racing talent.The absence of Froome may have diminished the Sky-Ineos aura of invincibility, but tactically Ineos were discreet and opportunistic, managing an indisputably weaker lineup than in past years and exploiting the ambitions of others to secure first and second overall.French riders lit up this Tour and without the bravura riding of Julian Alaphilippe and Thibaut Pinot, particularly in the Pyrenees when Thomas was not at his best, Bernal might not have leapfrogged his teammate to win the race.The Colombian’s instinct to follow Pinot’s accelerations on the Pyrenean summit finishes at the Col du Tourmalet and the climb to Foix Prat d’Albis revealed the gulf in climbing ability between him and Thomas.After that it was merely a question of Bernal being given his head and claiming the lead in the Alps. That moment came on the climb of the Col de l’Iseran, which Brailsford described as “37 minutes to win the Tour”.For all the talk of panache, flair and romance that characterised this Tour, Brailsford remained Spock-like in his analysis, stating he saw it as a “challenge of managing logic versus emotion”.“This race, more than most, triggered that debate in my head. However, I believed that if we stayed disciplined, chose the right strategy and executed well then it was hard to see a different outcome than winning. In the end strategy, patience and belief won over chaos.”That clinical assessment was proven correct but neglected to mention the honourable natures of his two leaders, who, unlike Wiggins and Froome, kept their cool in the Tour’s hothouse.“Egan’s got morals,” Thomas said. “Colombians are honest and family-oriented and I definitely feel that with Egan. The biggest thing is that he can speak English really well, so we can communicate.”Yet the togetherness that secured the top two steps on the Paris podium on Sunday has been a remarkable turnaround for a team who were staring at extinction less than six months ago, with their big name riders potentially in the marketplace looking for new teams.“We know in life the goal posts will move – we just don’t know when. So when they do it’s best to quickly adjust to the new situation, accept it and don’t spend any emotion feeling frustrated or bitter about it,” Brailsford said.“I couldn’t be prouder of how the team stuck together through this period and delivered both off the bike and on it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7192bb44a5e99b85e7eb3c8c9bec646812313711/0_180_5472_3285/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b4391f4b7c2639fe871a9e4d772c9f1","title":"kareem abdul jabbar beach volleyball","story":"The sport has come a long way since it was an excuse to hang out at the beach with a beer. The skills of its athletes are breathtaking Not many people know that my friend and mentor Wilt Chamberlain was not just one of the greatest basketball players who ever lived, he was also a world-class volleyball player. Although he didn’t start playing volleyball until he was 33 and still with the Los Angeles Lakers, he sponsored his own team, was a board member of the International Volleyball Association, and was eventually named to the Volleyball Hall of Fame. “For a long time, volleyball became as big a part of my life as basketball once was,” he said. “Being able to hold my own against the best in the world, on the beach or indoors, is something I’m very proud of.” Although he played both indoors and beach volleyball, I think beach suited his personality more.I was reminded of his intense passion while watching the beach volleyball world championships in Germany this summer. Forty-eight men’s teams and 48 women’s teams competed in one of the most grueling, graceful, explosive, and entertaining sports being played today. Watching the men and women spike, block, and e around a court that is almost impossible for two people to adequately cover makes one appreciate the elite level of athleticism necessary to be competitive on an international level. After basketball, it may very well may be the second-most exciting international sport.Originating in Hawaii, beach volleyball has been around since 1895. But that was merely the indoor version of six-person teams transferred to sand. The modern beach volleyball game of two-person teams was invented in 1930 by Paul “Pablo” Johnson on the Santa Monica beach. Bored with waiting for the rest of the players to arrive, he and three others mapped out a smaller court and began playing the first recorded game of two-a-side beach volleyball. It wasn’t until the 1970s and 1980s that beach volleyball became popular as, not just a sport, but a representative of beach culture. Surfing and volleyball became intertwined in the public’s mind and watching either came to represent an endless summer vibe of beach parties that lasted long into the night. If 1960s movies popularized the teen surfing scene as innocent Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello romping in the sand, the addition of beach volleyball in the 1980s added a bad-boy element, like remaking Beach Blanket Bingo but directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Jack Nicholson and Robert DeNiro.The professional beach volleyball stars of the 1980s played like pioneers of any sport: passionate and freewheeling, knowing they were defining the sport as it grew. Sometimes making it up as they went along. Sinjin Smith, Karch Kiraly, and Randy Stoklos were big personalities as well as big players. Tim Hovland was known for emotional outbursts, sometimes ripping off his shirt in anger. Kiraly once tore down a net during a match. These hormonal hijinks were good for popularizing the sport, bringing fans out to see a sport where anything could happen. Stoklos and Smith were even featured in the 1988 video game Kings of the Beach.Beach volleyball started to become popular outside the United States and in 1996, it became an official Olympic sport. In the six summer Olympics since the sport’s introduction, the US has won six of the available 12 gold medals. But as the sport’s popularity continues to grow, Americans are facing tougher and tougher competition. This makes the sport even more exciting because the play has become much more sophisticated. The old style of simply passing, setting, and crushing the ball is no longer as effective against 6ft 7in blockers and whipsaw fast diggers. Players are adapting by training all year around and by playing smarter and more strategically. As the prize money has grown, they’ve come to treat the sport like a serious profession and not just a fun lifestyle. A point won with an easy lob is worth just as much as a point won through a powerhouse spike. This more enlightened approach is due in part to the maturation of the aging players. Many of the top athletes are married with children, no longer representing the swinging single beach lifestyle, but family men and women striving to excel in a challenging sport.One of the most significant contributors to the sport’s growing popularity is the dynamic play of the women. Although their games are generally not as explosive as the men’s, they play with greater technique, variety of shots, and chess-like thinking, often making their matches more compelling. This was certainly true during this year’s world championships.Watching the FIVB finals demonstrates why the sport is so riveting. Although, the US team of April Ross and Alix Klineman were defeated by Canada’s Sarah Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes, it was one of the most nail-biting finals of any sport. The final score of 23-21, 23-21 shows the Americans had opportunities to win in both sets, but were ultimately unable to capitalize. Despite each team having a 6ft 5in player blocking at the net, the standout player was Canada’s 5ft 9in Pavan, who dug meteoric spikes and placed shots with surgical precision. The men’s gold medal match between Russia and Germany was equally thrilling, with Russia winning the tie-breaking set. In both finals – and in all the matches leading up to them – fans witnessed amazing feats of athleticism. Hits that seemed impossible to even touch were dug by players ing through the sand, then popping up to hit the set. You can’t watch for more than a minute without seeing an extraordinary play that seems to defy what the human body is capable of doing.Beach volleyball may no longer be a celebration of the laid-back, hang-loose, beers around the beach fire pit that it was a few decades ago. But shedding that weight has turned it into a sport that constantly challenges the physical and mental limitations of athletes and finds them up to that challenge. I certainly understand why Wilt loved the game so much."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7a59233678f1a8ac27712f84de4cf034312ae92/324_103_3126_1875/master/3126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26856559890980194feaa50d142e00c0","title":"england australia lords cricket ashes","story":"England are best when underrated in the Ashes but after Lord’s feats they must beware thinking they can recover any situationA clique of radical extremists have seized the levers of power. A risky event that was unthinkable three years ago now seems unstoppable. Those with experience and acknowledged expertise have been marginalised. Dissent is discouraged.Sensible people are sceptical, uneasy. Lesser officials suppress their doubts and keep working within the system, hoping the leaders are right and that the damage will be less than they fear. They block out fears of ruin and look forward to promised cash. But many others stand aside aghast, some believing the only hope now is for the revolution to happen and fail so that life as we know it can somehow be restored …But that’s enough about the England and Wales Cricket Board and its 16.4-over competition between confected teams (The Hundred) which is due to dominate future seasons. If it bears some resemblance to some other current situation, well, we are living in crazed times. As Lord’s goes, so goes the Commons.In both cases, however, the present day is unaffected. It’s holiday time, hooray. The weather has been what we used to call lovely. Even that is now a source of future alarm, but it doesn’t feel very alarming from my hammock. And on Thursday the grandest and most immutable of all cricket events begins: the Ashes.On my wall is a Punch cartoon from 1926, by Kenneth Beauchamp. On a country lane, a grand dame in a fur coat is talking to a man in a flat cap who might be her gamekeeper. “And do you think, Mr Jones,” she is saying, “our men will get the cinders back from the Australians?” (The charm of the art makes it funnier than it sounds.) Nearly a hundred years on, the same question is being asked, if less universally.England did get the cinders back in 1926, winning at the Oval after four draws. It was a wet summer and far from a vintage series. The whole tour lasted from April to mid-September and included such exotica as a three-day fixture against the Civil Service at Chiswick. But the Tests were spread over the months of high summer: by August only the Oval was left. They did not start with ripening apples and the football season.The ball is still red and the clothes still white. The attendances 93 years ago were pretty much what we might expect now: an average 20,000 a day. Pretty much everything else will have changed including the concept of the umpire’s decision being final, once regarded as the epitome of English decency and sense. In 2019, this will be embodied by the crowds booing Warner, Smith and Bancroft and thinking themselves hilarious.The cinders question was certainly being asked at the Cheltenham Festival last week. But only between more pressing matters. Almost unreported, Gloucestershire put on something close to the perfect first-class cricket match – in fine weather before good crowds, it went to almost the last syllable of recorded time before the home team eked out an improbable victory over their neighbours Worcestershire. Some officials reckoned the 10-day festival as a whole may have been the most successful in decades certainly last Monday was the best-attended day of county cricket I’ve seen in yonks. And the Twenty20 on Thursday was a sell-out.This can, in part, be attributed to the post-super over bounce. This worries me. Historically, England play best when most underrated. The risk now, after their two memorable visits to Lord’s this month, is that they imagine they can escape from every hole, even the Marianas Trench. This is the illusion associated with Ian Botham and it lost more games than it won.The truncated timescale – 47 days against 68 in 1926 – favours England. Since 2005 the home team has won seven Ashes out of eight (the exception being the Strauss-led and Cook-powered England triumph of 2010-11). The intensity is hardest on the visiting team’s more limited stock of fast bowlers and, if they go behind, the sheer joylessness of modern tours saps the whole squad’s morale.The most startling recent change to consider is the way the draw has become almost as rare as the tie: 19 consecutive undrawn England home Tests, one in the past 33. It’s not climate-related, more to do with better drainage, floodlights, add-on playing time and above all, incompetent batsmanship. The enduring truth of the Ashes, though, is that in advance we know damn all. No point in comparing teams man-for-man: heroes arise from nowhere.Right now many of us might think Marnus Labuschagne is a Slovakian handball player even though he has scored 1,000 runs this season for Glamorgan. This time next week we may know better. Whatever transpires, let’s revel in it.The Ashes is still one of the wonders of the sporting world. Drink deep and be merry because tomorrow, one way or another, we’re tatered.In pure cricket terms, the 2020 fixture list is going to be infinitely more dreadful than the current shambles: no one knows – even at this late stage – what form Cheltenham might take next year. Or when it will be. Or, at worst, even if. This beloved institution is bedevilled by English cricket’s chaos like everything else in the game.Still, the game is not necessarily well run in Australia either. Last week the Sydney Morning Herald revealed that Cricket Australia’s participation figures were bogus. It had claimed one in 15 Australians were active cricketers. This was based, the paper said, on double and even triple counting: 684,000 club players were really 247,000.Rather than booing visiting players, spectators should be booing the obscure figures who now run the game. But they lurk unknown for good reason."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6665315cbff0d83434c51544905e0dfc90feac2f/0_371_4220_2533/master/4220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb970135720e32d204588e30218aef18","title":"lev parts of love review bold tendencies london sharon eyal choreographer","story":"Bold Tendencies, LondonUltra-stylised sensuality and magnetic aloofness are among the hallmarks of choreographer Sharon Eyal’s compelling creationsThis reminds me of Berlin, says my friend, watching the cool, beautiful bodies of L-E-V’s dancers in the brutalist setting of a multistorey car park, as cocktail-fuelled revelry rages upstairs and a stiff south London breeze sweeps through the gaps in the concrete.Israeli choreographer Sharon Eyal is in residence at Bold Tendencies, the Peckham car park turned art gallery. The company’s presence amid the buzz of hipster nightlife makes sense, with work that carries echoes of the dancefloor, the dangerous edge of life after dark, and a co-director, Gai Behar, who is a former party producer.This first of four programmes features extracts from Eyal’s repertoire, starting with a mesmeric solo that glues us to the slow movement of bones and muscles shifting under the skin: pelvises, shoulder blades, fascia being stretched, joints pushed out of line.Eyal’s style is distinctive: model-like limbs indulgently elongated or corrugated into sharp angles balletic control and flashes of classical lines an underlying carnality, ultra-stylised, as in an expensive perfume campaign and an aloofness that is magnetic, like the person you fancy more than they fancy you. Eyal knows how to make the body an object of desire, but with no obvious come-on there’s deep sensuality, but androgynous detachment. And there is compelling movement, the eight immaculate dancers often in unison and always wedded to an insistent bass – one reason why the work has an accessible pull, even in its physical oddness.There are more shows to come, including a new creation and a collaboration with record label Young Turks.

It’s there on Facebook, tagging photos from the class reunion, your cousin’s wedding and the office summer party. Google, Microsoft, Apple and others have built it into apps to compile albums of people who hang out together.It verifies who you are at airports and is the latest biometric to unlock your mobile phone where facial recognition apps abound. Need to confirm your identity for a £1,000 bank transfer? Just look into the camera.New applications crop up all the time. Want to know who’s at the door? A video doorbell with facial recognition will tell you, provided you’ve uploaded a photo of the person’s face. Other systems are used to spot missing persons and catch slackers who lie about the hours they spend in the office. Advertisers, of course, are in on the act. Thanks to facial recognition, billboards can now serve up ads based on an estimate of your sex, age and mood.Sometimes, yes. China uses facial recognition for racial profiling and its tracking and control of the Uighur muslims has been roundly condemned as a shameful first for a government.Its cameras also spot and fine jaywalkers, verify students at school gates, and monitor their expressions in lessons to ensure they are paying attention.Russia has embraced the technology too. In Moscow, video cameras scan the streets for “people of interest” and plans have been mooted to equip the police with glasses that work the same way.There have been reports that Israel is using facial recognition for covert tracking of Palestinians deep inside the West Bank. Meanwhile in Britain, the politan and South Wales police forces have trialled facial recognition to find people in football and rugby crowds, on city streets, and at commemorations and music festivals. Taylor Swift even installed the tech at a gig in California to weed out stalkers.Shops are increasingly installing the technology to deter and catch thieves. Next year, it will make its Olympic debut in Tokyo.Advances in three technical fields have played a major part: big data, deep convolutional neural networks and powerful graphics processing units or GPUs.Thanks to Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, Google and others, the internet holds billions of photos of people’s faces which have been scraped together into massive image datasets. They are used to train deep neural networks, a mainstay of modern artificial intelligence, to detect and recognise faces. The computational grunt work is often done on GPUs, the superfast chips that are dedicated to graphics processing. But there is more to it than flashy new technology. Over the past decade in particular, facial recognition systems have been deployed all over the place, and the data gathered from them has helped companies hone their technology.First off, the computer has to learn what a face is. This can be done by training an algorithm, usually a deep neural network, on a vast number of photos that have faces in known positions. Each time the algorithm is presented with an image, it estimates where the face is. The network will be rubbish at first, like a drunk playing pin the tail on the donkey. But if this is done multiple times, the algorithm improves and eventually masters the art of spotting a face. This is the face detection step.Next up is the recognition part. This is done in various ways, but it’s common to use a second neural network. It is fed a series of face pictures and learns – over many rounds – how best to tell one from another. Some algorithms explicitly map the face, measuring the distances between the eyes, nose and mouth and so on. Others map the face using more abstract features. Either way, the network outputs a vector for each face – a string of numbers that uniquely identifies the person among all the others in the training set.It’s not the only way the police use facial recognition. If a suspect has been picked up, officers can upload their mugshot and search CCTV footage to potentially trace the suspect’s movements back to the scene of a crime.But such great performance depends on ideal conditions: where a crisp and clear mugshot of an unknown person is checked against a database of other high quality photos. In the real world, images can be blurred or poorly lit, people look away from the camera, or may have a scarf over their face, or be much older than in their reference photo. All tend to reduce the accuracy.The technology has a terrible time with twins, the Nist tests found, with even the best algorithms muddling them up.Bias has long plagued facial recognition algorithms. The problem comes about when neural networks are trained on different numbers of faces from different groups of people. So if a system is trained on a million white male faces, but fewer women and people of colour, it will be less accurate for the latter groups. Less accuracy means more misidentifications and potentially more people being wrongly stopped and questioned.Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) found that Amazon’s Rekognition software wrongly identified 28 members of Congress as people who had previously been arrested. It disproportionately misidentified African-Americans and Latinos. Amazon said the ACLU had used the wrong settings.Police trials have highlighted further shortcomings of facial recognition. A Cardiff University review of the South Wales trials found that the force’s NEC NeoFace system froze, lagged and crashed when the screen was full of people and performed worse on gloomy days and in the late afternoon because the cameras ramped up their light sensitivity, making footage more “noisy”.During 55 hours of deployment the system flagged up 2,900 potential matches of which 2,755 were false positives. The police made 18 arrests using the system, but the Cardiff report does not state whether any of the iniduals were charged.The Welsh trial highlighted another challenge for facial recognition: lambs. Not farmyard fugitives but people on the watchlist who happen look like plenty of other people. While scanning the crowds at Welsh rugby matches, the NeoFace system spotted one woman on the South Wales police watch list 10 times. None of them were her.Tech firms around the world are developing facial recognition but the US, Russia, China, Japan, Israel and Europe lead the way. Some nations have embraced the technology more readily than others.China has millions of cameras connected to facial recognition software and Russia has declared hopes to expand its own surveillance networks. In Europe, as elsewhere, facial recognition has found its way into shops to spot thieves and into businesses to monitor staff and visitors, but live face recognition in public spaces is still mostly at trial stage.In the US, the police typically use facial recognition to search CCTV footage for suspects rather than scanning live crowds. But it is becoming more pervasive. A 2016 report from Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology found that half of all Americans are in police facial recognition databases, meaning that algorithms pick suspects from virtual line-ups of 117 million mostly law-abiding citizens.Not much. In Britain there is no law that gives the police the power to use facial recognition and no government policy on its use. This has led to what Paul Wiles, the Biometrics commissioner, calls a chaotic situation with the police deciding for themselves where and when it is appropriate to use facial recognition and what happens to the images the cameras capture.The campaign group, Liberty, has called for a complete ban on live facial recognition systems in public spaces, arguing that it destroys privacy and forces people to change their behaviour. The group has brought a judicial review against South Wales police over its use of the technology. Similar concerns were raised by the University of Essex in an independent review of the politan police force’s use of facial recognition. It found that people were wrongly stopped, and warned of “surveillance creep” where the technology ends up being used to track people who are not wanted by the courts. Live facial recognition, the report concluded, was likely to fall foul of human rights law.Another area of contention is watchlists. Despite a 2012 high court ruling that retaining images of innocent people was unlawful, the police have steadily built up a custody database of 20 million people, many of whom have never been convicted of a crime. Nonetheless, images from the database, and others scraped from social media, are used to create watchlists for use in facial recognition systems. In the private sector, the situation is even murkier, with shops and businesses deciding who goes on secret watchlists, and sharing images with other firms.In the US the situation is not much better. Only five states have laws that touch on the use of facial recognition by law enforcement. The patchwork of laws means that while the Seattle police force and San Francisco city have banned live facial recognition, the sheriff’s office in Maricopa County, Arizona, uploaded the photo and driver’s licence of every resident in Honduras to its facial recognition watchlist.While facial recognition technology has drawn huge attention, the police and other organisations are looking carefully at new biometrics, beyond fingerprints and DNA, that uniquely identify people.Skin texture analysis is said to overcome problems with facial recognition caused by different expressions and partially covered faces by analysing the distance between skin pores. It has not been tested much, but developers claim it could be good enough to distinguish between twins.Another biometric that interests the police, because it can be done at a distance without a person’s cooperation, is gait analysis. As the name suggests, the algorithms identify people by the unique style of their stride, reflecting differences in anatomy, genetics, social background, habits and personality.With vein recognition, optical scanners are used to map blood vessels in the hand, finger or eye. Because our veins are buried beneath the skin, the scanners are considered hard to fool. Fujitsu’s PalmSecure system uses vein maps to monitor the to and fro of employees at various businesses.Speaker recognition is already used by banks and the HMRC to confirm people’s identities and its use is spreading. Unlike speech recognition, which translates sounds to words, speaker recognition detects the unique acoustic patterns created by an inidual’s vocal tract and their speech habits.Meanwhile, tech firms are improving their systems to work faster, with more faces, and with ever-more-difficult images, such as those taken in bad light or when people have their faces covered. Though still in its infancy, work is under way on algorithms that can identify people wearing masks and other disguises. To make recognition systems even more effective, face biometrics will be combined with others such as voice and gait, according to the Home Office’s 2018 Biometrics Strategy. Unsurprisingly, an arms race is afoot: researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have developed their own sunglasses to fool facial recognition: one male researcher who wore a pair was identified as Milla Jovovich.Our Biometric Future: Facial Recognition Technology and the Culture of Surveillance Kelly A GatesPrivacy in the Face of Surveillance: Fourth Amendment Considerations for Facial Recognition Technology Naval Postgraduate SchoolHandbook of Face Recognition Stan Z Li and Anil K Jain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6a94ecca5c1df6696f6673fe657e5d16819933/366_620_5634_3380/master/5634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50cf54387af422903f38673d86531d58","title":"locals guide to plovdiv bulgaria 10 top tips capital of culture","story":"As a 2019 European Capital of Culture, this ancient city will reflect its Roman, Persian and Ottoman influences, and focus on Kapana, its new creative quarterBanitsa is a Bulgarian breakfast staple. The flaky pastry parcels are filled with sirene cheese (similar to Greek feta). One of the best places to try one is at Bakeland, on the edge of the Kapana and Old Town districts. It also makes delicious handmade cakes and sweets, with a few gluten-free options.The Ancient Theatre is Plov’s most famous cultural landmark: a Roman amphitheatre in a dramatic position on a hill above the city. Visitors can enjoy performances by the Plov Opera and its international guests while sitting on ancient marble seats looking over the whole city centre, with the Rhodope mountains in the distance – a breathtaking spectacle.• bulgariatravel.orgKapana is now the creative heart of the city, a pedestrianised area full of shops, restaurants and galleries. In the 1990s it was a parking zone full of ruined houses. The transformation began in 2014, when 10 creative enterprises moved into the area, funded by the European Capital of Culture Foundation, and things have taken off from there. The best place to enjoy the city’s art scene is a space called Cu29. It combines a cafe and gallery and was established by artist Velizar Dimchev to promote emerging talent from Plov. Afterwards grab a drink at Kapana’s coolest cocktail bar, Ginger Tale.Hilly Plov old town is famed for its photogenic winding cobbled streets and beautifully preserved Ottoman-era townhouses. One of the most splendid is the Hindliyan House, whose Armenian merchant owner installed a rose-water fountain in the hayet, or main living space. This has recently been restored to its former, fragrant glory – the smell fills the room. Another favourite is Klianti House, which has beautifully painted ceilings and half-size rooms with tiny doors that were once used for storing the merchant’s wares. It feels like you have entered floor 7½ in Being John Malkovich.• Entry to each house 5 Lev (£2.29). A £7 ticket gives entry to five Old Town locationsThe dusty plain on which Plov is built has a perfect climate for growing grapes, particularly red varieties, such as the rich, dark mavrud (apparently, it has been grown here since Thracian times). Bulgaria Wine Tours organises wine-tasting trips from a half-day to a week (from €80 for a half-day, reductions for groups of over three). Local vineyards of note include Dragomir, Villa Yustine and the organic Zagreus. If you don’t have time for a wine-tasting trip, another top producer, Bendida, has a bar and shop in the pedestrianised Kapana district. It’s run by the third generation of the Portev family, who have a vineyard a few miles outside the city in the foothills of the Rhodope mountains. The family tradition is in safe hands: daughter Elizabet is already producing award-winning rosés.Food is another of Plov’s strengths, and a new generation of restaurateurs are using local ingredients to turn out modern takes on traditional Bulgarian food. The hottest place in town is Pavaj (mains from £6). Its young owners, Raycho Markov and Madlen Pakratyan, are obsessive about their trade, from growing rare heritage tomatoes in Markov’s father’s garden in the mountains to travelling the Balkans in search of great rakia (fruit brandy). Ask nicely and they may offer you samples from the restaurant’s impressive collection. The food is simple and seasonal, from salads and meatballs to grilled sheep’s cheese and bread made to Raycho’s grandmother’s recipe. The pillow-soft rolls are cut in half, fried in clarified butter and sprinkled with a salt and spice mix. It may just be the most addictive thing you try in Bulgaria. Be sure to book ahead. Another good option is the recently opened Aylyakriya, (Kozhukarska 3), also in Kapana, that does smart takes on traditional dishes, such as kačamak (polenta), pork ribs and beans and an exceptional strawberry cheesecake (mains from around £6).On the edge of the old town and overlooking the Kapana district, the shady terrace of Restaurant Philoppopolis (mains from about £12) has one of the best views in the city (Philoppopolis was the ancient name for Plov). The interior is in 1920s Viennese style and there is a gallery and museum in the same building. It’s the most romantic place to eat in Plov. A classy option in the centre of town is Hemingway Restaurant, which serves sophisticated Bulgarian and European dishes (mains from £7).Magura Street in Kapana is full of shops selling local crafts and souvenirs. There are places to buy handmade belts with ornate buckles and the pagan kukere masks worn by Bulgarians to scare off evil spirits during midwinter celebrations. Piuma D’oro has beautiful sandals, leather bags and jewellery designed and handmade by its owner, Polina Kozarova. She worked as a shoe designer for 23 years before opening her own shop three years ago. For me this sums up the story of Kapana: it provides spaces for people to pursue their craft and sell what they make directly to customers. In the old town, the Street of Crafts, Stramna, is another place to buy local wares and see artisans at work in their studios.Plov was built on seven hills. There are actually only six now: one was quarried for materials to construct the city centuries ago. The most popular for tourists is Nebet Tepe, one of the three hills of the Old Town. The earliest archaeological remains date from 4,000BC (Plov claims to be the oldest continually inhabited city in Europe). But Bunardzhik Tepe, also known as Alyosha Hill, with its huge Soviet soldier statue looming at the summit, is particularly special. The view from the top is superb and it’s often a setting for open-air parties.Getting there Plov is a 2.5-hour bus ride from Sofia. Stay Hotel Evmolpia (doubles from £44 B\u0026ampB) is a new boutique hotel in the Old Town. The newly renovated Stay Hotel (doubles from £45 B\u0026ampB) is in the city centre, just off Central Square. Best time to visit Spring and autumn are particularly lovely in Plov. The city gets hot in July and August (average highs of 30C), but the city stays alive with festivals. This year there is a full programme of cultural events for the European Capital of Culture celebrations. Winters are cold (average highs between -2C and 7C), and snow is not uncommon. It’s fairly dry, with only 127mm of precipitation a year (London has 590mm, Manchester 930mm). In late September the city hosts trade fairs that push rates higher (2019: 23-28 September).Prices Beer (half litre) £1, cappuccino £1.10, three-course meal for two £18.50.Svetlana Kuyumdzhieva is artistic director of Plov European Capital of Culture 2019, and Rumyana Tolova, is a PR professional in the city.

Ken Burns received an 8mm movie camera, the first step on a path that made him such a revered figure in documentary film-making that, five decades later, his birthday this year will be celebrated with a whole day of his work on the PBS network.If 66 seems an odd birthday to be so honoured, it is because, on the more conventional landmark last year, Burns was locked away editing his latest eight-part, 16-hour series, Country Music, which airs in September. That work forms, with Baseball and Jazz, a loose trilogy about emblematically American sports and culture. Those series are a peacetime balance to another thematic trio: The Civil War, The War and The Vietnam War, grippingly authoritative revisitings of the conflicts in which America was engaged between 1861-65, 1941-45, and 1954-73.What had Burns learned from selecting his retrospective? “While the stories I have told stretch from the 18th century to the 21st, all asked one deceptively simple question: who are we? That strange and very complicated people who like to call ourselves Americans. I’ve had the privilege to work for 45 years in the space between this two-letter plural pronoun ‘us’ and its capitalised equivalent in my country: the US. The opportunity not to tell just a traditional top-down story – Winston Churchill in the war room – but the bottom-up story of what it’s like to be on the battlefield or the street.”Although Burns had made earlier impact with cinema documentaries – Brooklyn Bridge and The Statue of Liberty were both Oscar-nominated – his defining work began in 1990 with a move into long-form television histories, for the nine-part The Civil War, charting the fight between north and south over slavery. For Burns, this was the only place to begin his grand project of historical self-analysis. “It was,” he says, “the greatest existential threat to the United States. We had been founded in 1776 on the assumption that all men are created equal. But – four score and five years later – four million Americans were owned by other Americans.”Critics, with their cataloguing habits, have assumed that Burns set out to create a war trilogy. But the film-maker protests: “It really wasn’t. There’s been no agenda. I have been drawn to subjects completely emotionally: I’m finishing something up and my eye is drawn to something else. When The Civil War series was finished, it had been so emotionally wrenching to work on that story – even though we were at a remove of 150 years – that I vowed never to do another film on war. Then I realised that my next series, Baseball, was actually a sequel to The Civil War. Although people always look at me as if I’m crazy when I say that.”Such looks are echoed in my bemused silence down a phone line to Burns’ office in New Hampshire. He explains, though, that “the first real progress with regard to race after the Civil War” came when, on 14 April 1947, Jackie Robinson walked out for the Brooklyn Dodgers as the first African American to play Major League Baseball.Working on Baseball, Burns decided that the best musical soundtrack for that story was jazz: “And I realised that – though I had grown up listening to jazz, which my father enjoyed – I was woefully ignorant about what it was, and its racial significance. So, for me, Civil War, Baseball and Jazz are a sort of war trilogy.”When Jazz was released in 2001, Burns was still expecting to stick to his pledge never formally to document another American conflict. “Then I learned that 1,000 Americans a day, veterans of the second world war, were dying, and I realised those memories were quickly going to disappear. I also discovered that many, many high-school students thought we fought with the Germans against the Russians. I was so stunned at that gross ignorance that I decided to do the world war two film. Then, even before we had finished that project, I had decided to do Vietnam, which took almost 11 years.”The projects take so long because of the exhaustive collection of material – “For Country Music, I had 101 interviews, representing 175 hours of conversation, and 1,500 photographs” – and the perfectionist assemblage of the final film.“Many of my colleagues in this business,” says Burns, “will research for a certain period and then write a script, which informs the shooting and the editing. We never stop researching, never stop reading, looking for photographs, writing. Nothing is set in stone. I’ve got a neon sign, in cursive script, in my editing room that reads: It’s Complicated. Although most of the process of editing is by nature subtractive, often the last thing we do in the editing room is add something.”Rewatching The Civil War after having seen The Vietnam War, I was struck, in retrospect, by how audacious Burns had been to make the earlier series with none of the elements – living witnesses, contemporary news footage – that helped to make the latter so impressive. Had he worried at the time about filling 11 and half hours of TV with a story from a pre-cinematic era? “Abraham Lincoln, faced with a whole string of second-rate, inferior generals, said, ‘We must use the tools we have.’ Each film has been an exercise in saying, ‘How do we do this?’ Sometimes, there can be a tyranny towards too much footage. Sometimes, in Vietnam and Baseball, we used still photographs, even though film was available.”Burns is nervous of formulas for film-making. “I see style as the authentic application of technique. And there are dozens of techniques that might be employed. Put simply, I have eight basic elements at my disposal: four visual, four aural. At any time, we have the possibility of – visually – interviews, or ‘talking heads’, live cinematography, still photographs, motion pictures. Aurally, we will have a third-person narrator a chorus of third person voices, reading the journals or love letters of the period a complex Hollywood-style sound-effects track and music, which is recorded before the editing.”Availability, though, should not mandate use. The first three images in Country Music, documenting a subject with a vast film and TV archive, are two still photos and a painting. Jazz and Country Music have another technical departure: “In documentary film-making, music is usually this important thing, but always in the background. So there is a beautiful shock in the music suddenly reaching this hyper-ground right in front of you. It happened to us several times while editing Jazz and Country Music.”A measure of Burns’ meticulousness is his attitude to “lower thirds”, the captions at the bottom of a screen, identifying speakers. Burns gives the job that they held at the point in the narrative we have reached, so newspaper reporters who later became celebrated novelists are identified with the job title on their press card at the time. That’s presumably a way of avoiding hindsight and keeping in the present tense. “Absolutely. In the world war two series, we interviewed a woman who was a widow, but we used her maiden name because, at that point, she was the sister of brothers we were talking about. It’s only in the final episode of the film, when she gets married, that we use her married name.”In the first episode of Country Music, which charts the geographical spread of the form, even superstars are identified by where they come from (“Dolly Parton, Tennessee”), rather than who they are.Yet, even for a producer as scrupulous as Burns, there is the challenge of living in an era when President Trump has pioneered the idea of “alternative facts”, and online posters increasingly regard history and news as a matter of opinion. Is that worrying for a maker of history documentaries? “Well, it’s certainly worrying as a citizen of the world, where we see not just the willingness of people to engage in dissembling, but the technological ability to do so. But a huge majority of your readers – and my viewers – are still interested in fact.“In anticipation of what we thought would be our most controversial film, The Vietnam War, we assembled what we called our war room of Republicans and Democrats on different sides of the debate, who were skilled in putting out fires. We did not need to use them because we were so fiercely loyal to facts. If you do that, people trust you. We tried to show that there can be more than one truth in war.”In an address to the graduating class at Stanford University in California in 2016, shortly before Trump became the Republican nominee, Burns warned that the reality-TV star had “a total lack of historical awareness, a political paranoia that, predictably, points fingers, always making the other wrong … The sense of commonwealth, of shared sacrifice, of trust, so much a part of American life, is eroding fast, spurred along and amplified by an amoral internet that permits a lie to circle the globe three times before the truth can get started.”Three years on, Burns says: “Everything I said, I’m so very sorry to say, has come true.” But, as a historian, does he see the 45th president as an aberration or a continuation? “I think he is without precedent, which is what makes him so dangerous. And yet he is the embodiment of certain tendencies and attitudes that have been present throughout our history – anti-immigration, anti-black, sort of proto-fascist, dissembling, all of that. We’ve just never had it so glaringly in a chief executive. And it seems to be what’s in the drinking water of the Earth at the moment as you watch the ascension of Boris Johnson, the rise of dictators in Turkey and Hungary and the Philippines. There is a tendency to suggest that you can be expedient with the truth – and I don’t think you can.”Burns’ accidental war trilogy is about to become an informal quartet, with a planned series about the American revolutionary wars of 1775-83. “I don’t want, as we tend to do in this country, to make it a superficial, sanitised event among a few dozen white men in Philadelphia, but to cover everything that was going on from New Hampshire to Georgia, the people who stayed loyal to Great Britain, African-Americans, British soldiers, American officers. And so, despite constantly never wanting to make another war film, I keep doing so because it is where human beings reveal themselves most prominently – for good or ill.”• Ken Burns Day is on PBS on 29 July.

But the TV journalist gets the stories and is ratings dynamiteStacey Dooley is so fresh-faced she could pass for a teenager. But, at 32, she has been making investigative programmes for 12 years, and has clocked up 80-odd documentaries around the world, taking on terrorists, paedophile networks, rightwing extremists and international drug dealers. She has just returned from Syria, where she met European Islamic State brides for her first Panorama and Nigeria, where she got to know Boko Haram’s female suicide bombers. Last year, she wrote a bestselling book about inspirational women and won Strictly Come Dancing. On Friday it was announced that she had signed a £250,000-a-year golden handcuffs deal to work only for the BBC.Earlier this year, she found herself splashed across the tabloids – first for starting a relationship with her Strictly dance partner Kevin Clifton, then for being labelled “a white saviour” by the Labour MP David Lammy after making a Comic Relief documentary and posting a photo of herself and a young Ugandan child on social media. It’s been a busy old time.Dooley is a one-off: a working-class woman who left school with no qualifications, swears like a trooper, reports from the world’s most hostile territories and frequently tops the TV ratings charts. She has achieved the seemingly impossible – presenting programmes about subjects so bleak they would make most BBC editors blanch, while encouraging a generation of news-shy young people to embrace world affairs. Women, children, the marginalised and the exploited are at the heart of her documentaries. Last year, she won an MBE for her services to journalism.“Hi, I’m Stacey,” she says with a wink and a handshake when we meet in a London restaurant. Her fans might expect a hug – she is famously tactile in her documentaries – but perhaps the real Dooley is more complex than the empathetic naif who loves to tell it straight. Sure, she is warm and direct, but she is also businesslike.Dooley says she is the hardest-working person she knows. “It’s one of my few talents,” she admits. “I’ve always had a decent work ethic, probably because of my mother, when it was just her and me. She just worked so hard. She’d get up at silly o’clock, clean her pal’s house, then do her day job, then work in pubs at night.” Dooley’s father, who had a drink problem, was not part of her life. Her mother later met her partner, Norman, and they had a child together – Dooley’s sister. Both girls were bridesmaids at their wedding. But it was the early years that shaped Dooley.She grew up with her mother in Luton, in Bedfordshire, surrounded by rightwing extremists and Islamist fundamentalists. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, AKA Tommy Robinson, went to her school (she confronted him and al-Muhajiroun activists in the film My Hometown Fanatics). Young Stacey was mouthy and opinionated. Again, she says, it was down to her mother. “My mum stands up for what she thinks is right. She’s tough.” Has Dooley got that toughness? “Yes. I’ve always been quite bloody-minded. You’ve got to have the courage to say what you believe.”That bloody-mindedness came into its own in her early teens. “I was a nightmare.” In what way? “I wasn’t frightened of authority. I just did whatever I wanted.” She started drinking, clubbing, bunking off school. “I probably drove my mum loopy. I wouldn’t come home and I’d be out smoking and drinking.” Anything else? “I’d steal.” She smiles. “Nothing ridiculous like cars. I’d just go down the Arndale and rob a couple of Morgan tops. The thing I nicked the most was blue eyeliner from the chemist. I was always wearing blue eyeliner and blue mascara, which, on reflection, probably wasn’t my best look.” Did she steal with friends? “Yes. But I was good. I never got caught.”These days, she says, she’s a goody-goody – no smoking, no drinking, no tea-leafing. As for drugs, she has never touched them. She says she saw too much when she was growing up. “We lost a friend to drugs we lost another friend to drink. He didn’t reach 18. We all used to drink. Then you get yourself in a mess and you fall asleep and choke on your own sick …” She trails off. “That wasn’t the moment I thought: ‘I’m never drinking again.’ But I’m sure it makes you think twice.”Dooley says the story that she left school at 15 without qualifications is not quite right. She turned up for three of her GCSEs (English, Music and Biology), but she never bothered collecting her results. Her face lights up. “Maybe I did really well. I might have got three As and I’ve been underselling myself all this time!”She sold perfume by day at Luton airport and did pub work in the evening, spending all her money on clothes – most of them cheap and throwaway. One day, her mother spotted an advert for young people who were obsessed with fast fashion to go to India and discover how their clothes were made. “It said: ‘Do you like travel, do you like fashion, do you like telly?’ And for me it was tick, tick, tick.” As soon as she applied for the job, she knew she would get it. Again, the Dooley confidence. “You’ve got to think: ‘Why not me?’ They’ve got to have someone.”Watch Blood, Sweat and T-shirts now, 10 years on, and you can see that Dooley arrived almost fully formed. She was unfiltered, pasionate and addressed the camera as if it was her best friend. In one scene, after talking to a tiny boy who was sent by his family to work in a Bombay factory, she turns to the camera, outraged and tearful. “Sorry, the boss of the factory Mohammed was working at used to beat him up really bad, so he ran away. He’s just a baby and he got beaten up by a grown man. It just makes you feel sick.” The tears became another Dooley trademark.After returning from India she was invited by the then controller of BBC Three, Danny Cohen, to make her own documentaries. She asked simple, heartfelt questions that trained journalists were often too polite or cerebral to ask. Occasionally, Dooley has almost become a self-parody – asking for a couple of minutes while she turns away to weep, ranting at the world’s injustices, wrapping her arms around a victim she has just met. But so much of her portfolio is amazing – asking an Isis fighter who said he had killed 900 people and raped 200 women: “What was going through your mind when these girls were screaming for you to stop and you don’t?” telling a drug dealer he is a hypocrite because he wouldn’t dream of selling to his children confronting women who have sold their children for sex.Has she become addicted to violence and war zones like so many foreign correspondents? No, she says, she can’t wait to get away. So many people who do her work have PTSD, she says, but she’s lucky. She doesn’t even have nightmares. “I think it’s because my mind is clear … You have to look after yourself mentally when you’re making films about incest and paedophilia and cartels cutting people’s heads off.” After a tough day, she switches off by listening to Little Mix. (“I love Woman Like Me.” Does her work scare her? “I’m such a wimp. I don’t even like flying, so it is slightly ridiculous that I do this job.” She says she was most terrified in north-east Nigeria. “I was in Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and there were times when I thought I might have to leave early because I can’t handle feeling frightened like this. Every night you could hear the military shelling, and you’re thinking: ‘How am I going to get out?’” Did she tell her mother she was in Maiduguri? She grins. “No, I told her I was in Lagos.” How does your mum feel about you lying? “It’s for her own good because all she would do is panic.”Dooley’s work has politicised her. After all the abuses she has witnessed in criminalised drugs and sex industries, she would consider legalising both. She has always voted Labour. “I always think it’s odd when people say: ‘I don’t give a fuck about politics,’ because it determines how you live.” We meet the day Boris Johnson moves into No 10. “I don’t know how long he’ll last,” she says.Colleagues are less snobbish to her than they used to be, she says. What’s the worst thing they have said? “Oh God, I’ve had it all. Sometimes they would say: ‘Ooh, you’ve got holes in your jeans,’ or mimic my accent.” Did she give them a mouthful? “No.” Why not? “Because I don’t give a fuck what they think. Some people don’t understand why I’m there. But I work really hard and I deserve to be there. And our documentaries speak for themselves. We are always top three on iPlayer and often we are most watched factual. The only one we can’t beat is EastEnders.”If some colleagues don’t appreciate the role she plays at the BBC, she certainly does. “We all pay our TV licence. It doesn’t matter whether you live on an estate in Luton or you live around the corner from Hyde Park and studied at Oxbridge – we all need to be heard. We all need to look at people on television and say: ‘Yeah, they represent me in some way.’ That’s where we’ve gone wrong in the past. I think the BBC would be the first to say current affairs is still too white and too middle-class and too male-heavy.”What she says about people being heard is interesting, particularly in light of Lammy’s “white saviour” attack on her. She fought back ferociously on Twitter. Does she think she might have misjudged it – that it would have been better to say ‘Let’s have a chat’ rather than beat him into submission? “I did say that a couple of times, but they never pick up on it. I would love to have spoken to David.” Does she now think he had a point? “I would take on board the criticism and bear in mind that people have certain views and I can’t tell people how to feel. I would be mindful of that.” Would she do Comic Relief again? “I believe in what they do. As one of the richest countries in the world, we have a responsibility to help those in need. Going forward, I hope we’re able to keep raising money in a way that everyone feels comfy with.” It’s funny – for a moment she sounds like a politician.When Dooley was invited to compete on Strictly, she was already well known. Now she is a household name. How has it changed her life? “There’s more interest in my personal life.” Is she surprised? “Yes.” Really? “Yes! What I’m surprised at is that I go to places like Syria and meet some of the most recognisable terrorists in the world or talk about things that will shape the global landscape – enormous topics that warrant front pages of papers – but they never go with that. They’ll always go with who I fancy or who I’m snogging.”Rant over, she acknowledges that Strictly has been wonderful for her, despite the fact that her ex-partner, Sam Tucknott, now has custody of their bulldog Bernie. Was there a fight over Bernie? “No. It would be irresponsible of me to take Bernie because I’m never here. Sam is amazing with him, and if I wanted to see Bernie, he would let me.”Her critics claim she has given up on the serious stuff for celebrity. Does it upset her? “Yeah, I think that’s an unfair statement. When you win Strictly, you can go down two paths. All the offers come in, and you can do very little work and put your name to things for lots of money, or you can go back to making documentaries in Syria and Nigeria and work really bloody hard. I said no to a lot of things I didn’t believe in. It’s not that I’m holier than thou, it’s just that it wasn’t for me. So I went back to the day job.”I ask again if she really expected us not to be interested in her private life after Strictly. Well, maybe not, she says, but she could always hope. “Kev and I have agreed not to go into too much detail about our private lives because you can’t really indulge that and then ask for privacy. That’s why we’ve turned down interviews that have offered us tens of thousands of pounds. What I am happy to say is Kev’s amazing, I’m happy, life happens, I’ve got an amazing career and I’m very lucky.”Did she expect to win Strictly? “I thought: ‘Why not – someone’s got to win it.’” Did she deserve to? “Yes!” she says instantly. “I worked really hard. I didn’t know how to waltz beforehand, I didn’t know what a ballroom frame looked like.” Did she work harder than everyone else? “Yes,” she says even more emphatically. She bursts out laughing.

Young couples should not kiss, hold hands or spend time alone together before marriage, he said. Dating was spiritually unhealthy and a “training ground for orce”, the book argued.The book, written by Harris when he was 21, was widely circulated within evangelical Christian youth groups, helping to promote a “purity culture” and vows to preserve virginity until marriage.Harris later became a senior pastor in the Covenant Life church in Gaithersburg, Maryland, which he left in 2015. The church had been accused of covering up allegations of child sexual abuse by failing to report the claims to police.Last year, Harris disavowed the ideas in I Kissed Dating Goodbye, saying in a statement: “I no longer agree with its central idea that dating should be avoided. I now think dating can be a healthy part of a person developing relationally and learning the qualities that matter most in a partner.“To those who read my book and were misdirected or unhelpfully influenced by it, I am sincerely sorry.”This month he announced on Instagram that he and his wife were separating after 21 years of marriage because “significant changes have taken place in both of us”.Another Instagram message posted nine days later said he had “undergone a massive shift in regard to my faith in Jesus”.He wrote: “The popular phrase for this is ‘deconstruction’, the biblical phrase is ‘falling away’. By all the measurements that I have for defining a Christian, I am not a Christian. Many people tell me that there is a different way to practise faith and I want to remain open to this, but I’m not there now.”He added: “I have lived in repentance for the past several years – repenting of my self-righteousness, my fear-based approach to life, the teaching of my books, my views of women in the church, and my approach to parenting to name a few.“But I specifically want to add to this list now: to the LGBTQ+ community, I want to say that I am sorry for the views that I taught in my books and as a pastor regarding sexuality.“I regret standing against marriage equality, for not affirming you and your place in the church, and for any ways that my writing and speaking contributed to a culture of exclusion and bigotry. I hope you can forgive me.”His bestselling book was to be discontinued because of its “flaws”, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0e411f5b4c387cd8b275f0794a3618210c5b216/0_339_5081_3048/master/5081.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a314b49c9594a8c35e2e5f6ef4cccd4c","title":"india wild tiger population rises conservation","story":"A census found 2,967 tigers, up from 2,226 four years ago, in what the prime minister called a “historic achievement”.“We reaffirm our commitment towards protecting the tiger,” Narendra Modi said as he released the report. “Some 15 years ago, there was serious concern about the decline in the population of tigers. It was a big challenge for us but with determination, we have achieved our goals.”The survey is conducted every four years, with the latest census using 26,000 camera traps that took almost 350,000 images across known tiger habitats, the environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, said.The images were analysed using computer programmes to inidually identify each creature. Wildlife and forestry officials also scoured 380,000 sq km of terrain.In 1900, more than 100,000 tigers roamed the planet. But that fell to a record low of 3,200 in 2010. However, that year, India and 12 other countries with tiger populations signed an agreement to double their numbers by 2022.Since then, India’s tiger population has risen steadily, after falling to a record low of 1,411 in 2006. They are yet to return to the figures recorded in 2002 when there were about 3,700.About 40,000 tigers lived in India at the time of independence from Britain in 1947. Since then, the indiscriminate killing of the animal for its organs has pushed them to the edge of extinction.India’s growing population has also increasingly eaten into the territory of wild animals, leading to conflict with humans.Delhi has sought to improve its management of tigers, reserving 50 habitats – from Himalayan foothills in the north-east to regions in west and central India – exclusively for the animals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae93a0dcf3ec0b6b6488512c3a581411d9076008/0_49_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24b80b81f47a37da714b8c3078033740","title":"vietnam seizes 125kg of smuggled rhino tusks worth 75m","story":"Shipment found at Hanoi airport is one of the biggest wildlife trafficking cases in south-east AsiaMore than 125kg of smuggled rhino horns have been seized in Vietnam in one of the biggest wildlife trafficking cases ever seen in south-east Asia.The horns, which had been smuggled in from the United Arab Emirates on an Etihad airways flight, were found in Hanoi’s Noi Bai airport concealed in thick plaster. It took over half a day for the customs teams to break all 55 packages all open.Rhino horns, which when ground to a powder are believed by some Vietnamese to have medicinal qualities to cure everything from cancer to a hangover, are particularly lucrative and can fetch up to $60,000 (£48,000) per kilo. The haul seized at Hanoi airport last week was worth around $7.5m (£6m).The seizure is part of a broader crackdown in Vietnam on the vast multi-million dollar wildlife trafficking network operating in the country, which has become a regional hub for the black market trade of everything from rhino horns and tiger skins and meat to elephant tusks and pangolin scales.Last week the Vietnamese authorities discovered seven frozen tiger cub corpses in the back of a car in Hanoi, which they believe had been smuggled in from Laos. It was unclear whether the tigers had been killed in captivity or shot in the wild, though authorities believe they were smuggled in to the country to sell as tiger meat and parts, which in Vietnam are used for jewellery and medicine.While international laws have made it illegal to trade in rhino horns since 1977, the black market trade – with the animals usually poached in Africa and then smuggled to Asia – has decimated the population, especially as demand from Vietnam and China has continued to grow. There are now only around 29,000 rhinos left in the world, according to the International Rhino Foundation, and it is estimated three rhinos a day are poached in South Africa alone.However, countries across south-east Asia, who in the past have been notoriously lax about enforcing the law, have collectively begun to crack down. Last week, Singapore authorities seized a record haul of nearly nine tonnes of contraband tusks from an estimated 300 elephants, worth $12.9m (£10.4m), and 11.9 tonnes of pangolin scales, from 2,000 animals, estimated to be worth about $37m (£30m).Earlier this month, a United Nations report laid bare the vast illegal wildlife network that was operating across southeast Asia. The report singled out Laos in particular as “a major global hub for the trafficking of high value and highly threatened species into other Asian markets” adding that the country had been identified as the world’s fastest growing ivory market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f97a9bf5b01e65b259825494ddf2676981c02b5f/0_268_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d37fadde731cfdf982735260e37e8b3","title":"dreaming of antarctica where beauty and fragility meet ","story":"Rona Mcseveny, a former patient of UCHL, is showcasing her photos of the continent at the hospital’s Street Gallery.

The Cork man remains optimistic that his status in the US could be normalised. An Irish man who was imprisoned as part of Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration says he is optimistic about winning the right to stay in the US.Keith Byrne (37), from Fermoy, Co Cork, was released from detention in Pennsylvania last week following a court ruling and was reunited with his family. However, he still faces deportation proceedings and may have to return to custody once his 30-day temporary release period expires.Mr Byrne, who lives in Philadelphia, first entered the US on a 90-day Visa Waiver programme in 2007. He stayed on in the US after his visa expired and married his wife Keren there two years later.He has been attempting to regularise his immigration status through the legal system for several years but a minor conviction from Ireland for cannabis possession has complicated his efforts.Mr Byrne said he was shocked and confused by his arrest because he had “been fighting for a long time to make things right”.He said it was “really special” to be reunited with his wife and children following two weeks in Pike County jail.“It’s good to be home. It’s where I belong.”US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers arrested Mr Byrne in Philadelphia as he drove to his painting business. He said he was put in cuffs and shackles before officers “threw him in a cell”.‘Horrible’Being sent back to Ireland would be “horrible”, he said, given he has a family and business in the US.“Nothing good comes from sending me home”.He said he was optimistic about winning the right to stay in the US with his family and that he would meet his legal team on Monday to discuss the next step.“I’m optimistic. I’m hopeful. I’m just going to leave it with the law and hopefully my lawyers can make it happen. I’m just going to keep working hard and keep doing what I was doing.”Mr Byrne said he “never hid” in the US and that his conviction for drugs possession was embarrassing.“It’s a 14-year-old fine that I paid in court. I don’t know what kind of message people are giving out by sending me home over that. I’ve made a good life over here so, I’ve paid my penalty.”Mr Byrne has until the end of August to seek a judicial review of the decision of the US authorities to deny his legal status.However, the order states that “nothing . . . precludes the United States and ICE from redetaining Keith Byrne or reinstituting removal proceedings”.Mr Byrne’s arrest was part of a wider crackdown by ICE officers in 10 major US cities. Most of the 2,000 migrants targeted were from central America and had crossed the US-Mexican border.The sweep had been touted ahead of time by Mr Trump, the US president, as a show of force against illegal immigration. However, the vast majority of the migrants targeted by ICE evaded arrest. According to the New York Times, only 35 people were detained."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3969973.1564330641!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"only a fraction of airbnb landlords register under new letting rules","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOnly a fraction of the landlords who have rented out properties on AirBnB and other home-sharing websites have registered them under the Government’s new short-term letting rules. File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe  Only a fraction of the landlords who have rented out properties on Airbnb and other “home-sharing” websites have registered them under the Government’s new short-term letting rules.Figures obtained from local authorities in rent pressure zones – in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick where the housing crisis is at its worst – show few people have registered their properties.The regulations have been in place since July 1st, when new legislation came into effect aimed at easing the housing crisis by freeing up available accommodation to address a shortage of rental properties.People intending to rent out properties in the pressure zones must either register with their local authority or apply for change-of-use planning permission to be able to let them out under the new rules. Only people who rent out a room in their home, or their entire home, for 90 days or less can register.Iniduals renting out a home for more than 90 days or landlords letting out a second property to tourist or others on a\u0026nbspshort-term basis must apply for planning permission either on a new or retention basis.Permission is likely to be denied in rent pressure zones, effectively banning short-term lettings in response to the housing shortages.Dublin City Council told The  that it had received 110 registrations for properties and four applications for planning permission as of last week.These figures contrast with the 6,228 active rentals in Dublin on Airbnb last year, according to AirDNA, a data service that analyses listings on the home-sharing website.AirDNA found that last year there were 2,856 entire homes in Dublin rented out for more than 90 days, while 3,398 home-sharers had rented out their homes for less than 90 days.Galway City Council has received eight registrations – known as Form 15 registrations under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2019 – and just one planning application.Limerick City Council had received just two notifications as of last week.A spokesman for Cork County Council said that it had received two Form 15 registrations but had not received any planning applications for change of use under the new regulations.The ability and resources available to investigate breaches of the regulations remain a concern for local authorities.Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy said late last month that 12 staff would be added to Dublin City Council to deal with planning applications over the coming months.Other councils have not received any extra resources, however.‘No enforcement’“The difficulty with this is the regulations came in but there is no enforcement resources coming with them so how do you find out if people are in breach? What canny detective work can be undertaken if it is just another task added on to the list of tasks that already have to be enforced,” said one council official.The official complained that it was “very difficult” to detect potential breaches of the legislation and obtain enough evidence “to go to court” without additional resources.Failure to comply with the regulations carries a maximum penalty of €5,000 or six months’ imprisonment or both.Airbnb objected to the new rules, warning that it would jeopardise more than €500 million generated by the home-sharing service for the economy in 2018."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3970514.1564387917!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit 100m beef fund for farmers announced","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe support scheme will mean beef farmers can claim aid of €100 per adult cattle slaughtered. Photograph: GettyMinister for Agriculture Michael Creed has announced an emergency Brexit aid package for Irish beef farmers worth €100 million.The support package will be made up of funds from the European Union and the Exchequer. The support scheme will open from the third week of August, and will mean beef farmers can claim aid of €100 per adult cattle slaughtered, for up to 100 cattle per herd, between last September and May 2019. Farmers can also claim €40 per suckler cow that calved over the course of last year, for up to 40 sucklers per herd.Only dairy herds of less than 40 cows will be eligible for the Brexit aid support, department officials said. Announcing the measures, Mr Creed said he was “keenly aware that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers.“There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance,” he said. There are conditions on the aid for farmers, and applicants must be members of a Bord Bia Quality Assurance Scheme, or an Department of Agriculture environmental scheme. Slaughtering factories will not be eligible for the support, and in the event the scheme is oversubscribed payments may be subject to “minor revision,” officials said. “The availability of this EU and Exchequer support, together with the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP) introduced earlier this year, provides an injection of up to €120m in aid for the beef sector in 2019,” Mr Creed said. In recent weeks the Government has come in for criticism over the EU-Mercosur deal, which will see tariffs cut and some 99,000 tonnes of South American beef allowed into the European market every year, which the Irish agriculture lobby said will hurt struggling beef farmers. Speaking on RTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland, Ms Chambers said “events of the last few days have been very concerning,” following prime minister Boris Johnson’s rise to Downing Street in Britain. “Businesses and farmers need to know what will the trading environment be post-Brexit, what the support package will be - not only what the Irish Government are going to put in place for farmers and businesses, but that the EU will put in place,” Ms Chambers said.

Photograph: Isabel InfantesAFPGettyBoris Johnson’s government is planning a huge increase in funding for a no-deal Brexit after one of his ministers said its working assumption was that the UK would leave the European Union without a deal on October 31st.Mr Johnson has set up a six-person “war cabinet” to oversee preparations for a no-deal Brexit, including a major public information campaign, and stepped-up logistical plans to mitigate disruption.Michael Gove, who until last week was his government’s most eloquent champion of the withdrawal agreement, said yesterday that planning for a no-deal Brexit was now the top priority.“The EU’s leaders have, so far, said they will not change their approach – it’s the unreformed withdrawal agreement, take it or leave it. We still hope they will change their minds, but we must operate on the assumption that they will not,” the cabinet office minister wrote in the Sunday Times.Chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid promised “significant extra funding” for hundreds of new Border Force officers and infrastructural improvements. He did not specify the size of the extra investment but reports suggest it could be as much as £1 billion.In Dublin, Government sources noted the stridency of the no-deal messages, and the change in rhetoric from London. A spokesman for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar noted that Mr Johnson had said he “wants to leave the EU with a deal”.“The Taoiseach looks forward to speaking with the prime minister in the near future and hearing about how he plans to do that,” the spokesman said, adding that the EU has said the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened but that there can be changes to the political declaration on the future relationship.“We continue to prepare intensively for no-deal,” he said.No contactNo phone call has yet been arranged between Mr Varadkar and Mr Johnson, but Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has spoken to Mr Javid, and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has been in contact with his UK counterpart, Dominic Raab.The Conservatives have enjoyed a poll boost since Mr Johnson took office as Brexit Party supporters have begun to swing behind the new prime minister. Labour has also seen a modest increase in its support but the Conservatives have opened up a 10-point lead.Chief secretary to the treasury Rishi Sunak said the government’s preference was to leave the EU with a deal but without what he called the “anti-democratic” backstop.But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson warned ahead of a visit to Scotland by Mr Johnson today that she could not support leaving the EU without a deal. “I don’t think the government should pursue a no-deal Brexit and, if it comes to it, I won’t support it,” she said.The EU has rejected Mr Johnson’s demand that the Northern Irish backstop should be removed from the withdrawal agreement, and French MEP Nathalie Loiseau said the agreement was the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit.“You have changed your prime minister, but we have not changed our minds,” she told Sky News. “The agreement is a compromise there are many concessions in it. We are protecting our citizens, peace on the island of Ireland. The agreement is not the devil, it’s a reasonable compromise to move forward.”Meanwhile, a committee set up in the United States to protect the Belfast Agreement, which includes five former US ambassadors to Ireland, has warned the incoming Northern Ireland secretary that a future US-UK trade deal will be “all but impossible” if the peace deal is undermined."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3969958.1564329439!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd democratic puritanism ruining 2020 hopes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi with fellow House Democrats on the steps outside the US Capitol. She is derided by the far left for her pragmatism, despite being a long-time target for Republicans. Photograph: Getty I, the daughter of a DC cop, and Carl, the son of an Illinois plumber, were hilariously painted as decadent aristocrats revelling like Marie Antoinette when we should have been knitting like Madame Defarge. Yo, proletariat: If the Democratic Party is going to be against chocolate, high heels, parties and fun, you’ve lost me.And I’ve got some bad news for you about 2020. The progressives are the modern Puritans. The Massachusetts Bay Colony is alive and well on the Potomac and Twitter. They eviscerate their natural allies for not being pure enough while placing all their hopes in a colour-inside-the-lines lifelong Republican prosecutor appointed by Ronald Reagan. The politics of purism makes people stupid. And nasty. My father stayed up all night the night Harry Truman was elected because he was so excited. I would like to stay up ’til dawn the night a Democrat wins next year because I’m so excited to see the moment when the despicable Donald Trump lumbers into a Marine helicopter and flies away for good.But Democrats are making that dream ever more distant because they are using their time knifing one another and those who want to be on their side instead of playing it smart. House Democrats forced Robert Mueller to testify, after he made it clear that he was spent and had nothing to add to his damning yet damnably legalistic, double-negative report, because they were hoping the hearings would jump-start howls for impeachment.But it’s hard to get the mad blood stirring with Muellerisms like “This is outside my purview” “I can’t get into that” “I don’t subscribe necessarily to your – the way you analyse that” and “I’m not going to go into the ins and outs.” I never want to hear about the “OLC opinion” again. The Republicans were impressively craven and hypocritical. They are sticking with Trump, and no pallid reminder of his turpitude, his trellis of obstructions and his unpatriotic embrace of foreign interference in our elections will change that.The always blockheaded Texas representative Louie Gohmert shouldn’t even be allowed to hold the coat of Mueller, a war hero and respected public official. But Gohmert yelled such crazy stuff at the former special counsel that he appeared to be auditioning for a spot on Fox News’ The Five.The hearings were shameful for Republicans thirsting for re-election and a failure for Democrats thirsting for impeachment. It was many underwhelming hours of members of Congress reading to Mueller and Mueller saying, Yes, that’s what I wrote. Or at least what somebody wrote.The recipe for emotional satisfaction on the part of the progressive left is not a recipe for removing Trump from the White House. The argument about whether Trump is impeachable is the wrong argument. Mueller settled that. We know Trump did things worthy of impeachment. That is not the question we should be asking. The question is: should he be impeached? The progressive Puritans think we must honour the US constitution and go for it because it’s the right thing to do. You can argue that impeachment, morally and constitutionally, is the right thing to do.But you also have to recognise that, historically and politically, it is not the right thing to do because it will lead to disaster. The attempt to impeach Trump is one of the rare cases in which something obviously justified is obviously stupid. Unbelievably, Pelosi – long a GOP target for her unalloyed liberalism – is derided by the far left for her pragmatism. But she has been through enough Washington wars to know that idealism, untempered by realism, is dangerous. An impeachment could return Trump to power. The highchair king from Fifth Avenue would exult in his victimhood and energise his always-ready-to-be aggrieved followers. It could also lead to Democrats losing the House as their moderates fall and help Republicans hold the Senate. No Republicans would vote for impeaching Trump, and some Democrats might refuse as well. Even if the House acted, Mitch McConnell would smother it in the Senate, just like he did Merrick Garland.It’s better to pull out Trump by the roots in the election and firmly repudiate him. The Democrats should focus on the future, not the benighted past that we have been relegated to under Trump. Hillary Clinton’s campaign focused on what a terrible person Trump is. It turned out that enough voters knew that and didn’t care. They wanted a racist Rottweiler. Now the Democrats are once more focused on what a terrible person Trump is.Message received, many times over.The progressives’ cry that they don’t care about the political consequences because they have a higher cause is just a purity racket. Their mantra is like that of Ferdinand I, the Holy Roman Emperor: “Fiat iustitia, et pereat mundus.” “Let justice be done, though the world perish.”The rest of us more imperfect beings don’t want the world to perish. And maybe justice can be done, without losing the White House, the House, chocolate, high heels, parties and fun."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Comment: Boris Johnson understands a simple truth – the better prepared we are for No Deal, the less likely it is to happenReappearance of cliff-etching tribute to Mussolini sparks row in ItalyBritain\u0026#39s youngest terrorist gets lifelong anonymity after lawyers argue he may become Isil poster boy if identifiedBrexit latest: Dominic Raab says Brussels \u0026#39isn\u0026#39t the only game in town\u0026#39 as he refuses to confirm if he will travel to European capitals as priorityChina says Hong Kong ‘will pay’ if protests continue in rare public statementComment: Cambridge University needs to tackle its institutional rape problemNarendra Modi surprise guest on Bear Grylls\u0026#39 Man vs WildIs it safe to visit Hong Kong?Dominic Raab rules out tanker exchange with IranVietnam seizes 125 kg of rhino horn worth £6m concealed in plaster shipment\u0026#39It\u0026#39s been pure insanity\u0026#39.

We regularly remind hosts to check and follow local rules - including on subsidised housing - and we take action on issues brought to our attention. Airbnb is the only platform that works with London to limit how often hosts can share their space and we support proposals from the Mayor of London for a registration system to help local authorities regulate short term lets and ensure rules are applied equally to hosts on all platforms in the capital.  Law and orderReappearance of cliff-etching tribute to Mussolini sparks row in ItalyBritain\u0026#39s youngest terrorist gets lifelong anonymity after lawyers argue he may become ISIS poster boy if identifiedBrexit latest: Dominic Raab says Brussels \u0026#39isn\u0026#39t the only game in town\u0026#39 as he refuses to confirm if he will travel to European capitals as priorityChina says Hong Kong ‘will pay’ if protests continue in rare public statementComment: Cambridge University needs to tackle its institutional rape problemNarendra Modi surprise guest on Bear Grylls\u0026#39 Man vs WildIs it safe to visit Hong Kong?Dominic Raab rules out tanker exchange with IranVietnam seizes 125 kg of rhino horn worth £6m concealed in plaster shipment\u0026#39It\u0026#39s been pure insanity\u0026#39.

I hope readers feel as inspired as I do, by the ‘Forces for Change’ they’ll find within these pages.”While it was the Duchess’s idea to feature 15 women on the cover, the 37-year-old eschewed the chance to appear alongside them as she deemed it “boastful” for this particular project.Instead, she identified a group of women she personally admired and felt “very strongly” about, some of whom she has met in the last year or two.The Duchess of Cambridge with Irish activist Sinead Burke, one of her Vogue cover starsThey include Adwoa Aboah, a mental health campaigner and model whom the Duchess appeared alongside on a panel marking International Women’s Day in March and Jameela Jamil, a body positivity advocate and actor whose Instagram account was one of a small selection recently highlighted by the Sussex’s.Jacinda Ardern, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who hosted the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their first joint overseas tour last October and said she had “real empathy” for the then-pregnant royal, also features, as does Sinead Burke, an Irish ersity activist who met the Duchess at a garden party in Dublin last July and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the novelist who hosted a talk with Michelle Obama attended by the Duchess in December.Others she has chosen to celebrate are Adut Akech, a South Sudanese model and former refugee, Ramla Ali, a London-based Somali boxer, Gemma Chan, a Kent-born campaigner and actor and Laverne Cox, the transgender activist and actor who stars in Orange is the New Black.The inclusion of Jane Fonda, the American actor and political activist, was likely inspired by the 2018 documentary Feminists: What Were They Thinking? which the Duchess referenced earlier this year after watching it on Netflix.The other women featured are Salma Hayek Pinault, the actor and women’s rights advocate, Francesca Hayward, the Kenyan-borm Royal Ballet principal dancer who stars in the remake of Cats, Greta Thunberg, the climate change campaigner, Christy Turlington Burns, the model and campaigner against maternal deaths and Yara Shahidi, the American actor and founder of Eighteen x 18, which is focused on engaging young people in politics.The September issue of British VogueThe 16th spot on the cover has been left blank, at the Duchess’s request, to represent a mirror designed to “include the reader and encourage them to use their own platforms to effect change.” The Duchess of Cambridge appeared on the cover of Vogue in 2016 to celebrate its centenary, in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery.She was the most senior royal to grace the cover since Diana, Princess of Wales, who featured four times, including a posthumous appearance in October 1997.The Princess Royal also appeared on the magazine\u0027s cover, in 1971. The Queen, the Duke of Windsor, the Prince of Wales and Princess Margaret have also featured inside.Mr Enninful said he was “delighted” that the Duchess had become the first person to guest edit the September issue, traditionally the biggest and best-selling and heralding the start of the fashion season.“To have the country’s most influential beacon of change guest edit British Vogue at this time has been an honour,  a pleasure and a wonderful surprise,” he said.“As you will see from her selections throughout this magazine, she is also willing to wade into more complex and nuanced areas, whether they concern female empowerment, mental health, race or privilege. “From the very beginning, we talked about the cover - whether she would be on it or not.  In the end, she felt that it would be in some ways a ‘boastful’ thing to do for this particular project. She wanted, instead, to focus on the women she admires.”In 2009, a documentary film called The September Issue gave a behind the scenes look as US editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and creative director Grace Coddington worked together on the 2007 US edition of the magazine.Sign up for Your Royal Appointment and get exclusive analysis and insight in our brilliant weekly newsletter.Duchess of SussexComment: Boris Johnson understands a simple truth – the better prepared we are for No Deal, the less likely it is to happenReappearance of cliff-etching tribute to Mussolini sparks row in ItalyBritain\u0026#39s youngest terrorist gets lifelong anonymity after lawyers argue he may become Isil poster boy if identifiedBrexit latest: Dominic Raab says Brussels \u0026#39isn\u0026#39t the only game in town\u0026#39 as he refuses to confirm if he will travel to European capitals as priorityChina says Hong Kong ‘will pay’ if protests continue in rare public statementComment: Cambridge University needs to tackle its institutional rape problemNarendra Modi surprise guest on Bear Grylls\u0026#39 Man vs WildIs it safe to visit Hong Kong?Dominic Raab rules out tanker exchange with IranVietnam seizes 125 kg of rhino horn worth £6m concealed in plaster shipment\u0026#39It\u0026#39s been pure insanity\u0026#39.

Jaden, 15, will share £1.8m with his playing partnerThe mother of a British schoolboy who won almost £1 million in the Fortnite World Cup has said that she tried to hard to stop him from playing the game that she threw out his Xbox and snapped his headset.Jaden  Ashman, 15, will split £1.8 million in prize money with his Dutch team-mate after winning second place in the Fortnite duos competition at the Athur Ashe stadium in New York City, which traditionally hosts the US Open tennis tournament.The teenager from Essex, who competes under the name Wolfiez, was among 100 Fortnite players who qualified for the game\u0027s first ever world cup, in which a total of more than £24 million is up for grabs with a top inidual prize of £2.4 million.But his mother, Lisa Dallman, said she didn\u0027t really know much about video games and had struggled to accept that his skill at Fortnite was more than a frivolous waste of time.It\u0027s not been a straightfoward journey with Jordan, Ms Dallman told BBC Five Live. If I\u0027m honest with you, I\u0027ve been quite against him gaming. I\u0027ve been more pushing him to his schoolwork. I\u0027ve actually thrown an Xbox out, snapped a headset, we\u0027ve had a nightmare.Leading up to the game, getting his visa, we had problems with that... then the dog ate his birth certificate. Then work messed up my wages. So three things went wrong before we started heading here.I had a feeling that Jaden was going to place top 10... he\u0027s come 2nd and I can\u0027t believe it.More than 100 players representing more than 30 countries competed in Fortnite\u0027s first World Cup, which is attempting to turn the game\u0027s massive international popularity into a glitzy competitive sport. The £24m prize pool is currently the biggest ever offered for any eSports event, though it is likely to be surpassed by the Dota 2 International in August.Ashman surprised many fans on Saturday by winning second place by using a joypad rather than a keyboard and mouse, which allow for finer control.Me and my mum, we clash quite a lot, he said after the tournament. She didn\u0027t understand how it worked, so she thought that I was spending eight hours a day in my room just wasting my time. Mow that I\u0027ve proved to her that I can do stuff, I\u0027m really happy.Other Brits also placed well in the duos tournament. Kyle Mongraal Jackson, 14, who became the youngest ever eSports player when he was recruited by a team aged 13, won half of £363,000 with 6th place, while Mac Itemm Gillivray came just behind him at 8th place.Altogether, British players won almost $1.4 million, with more money likely to flow from the singles tournament, in which Jackson and his fellow Brit Benjy David Fish (Benjyfishy) are tipped to place well. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Grace 1 was intercepted because it was in breach of sanctions and heading with oil to Syria,” Mr Raab said on the Today programme.“The Stena Impero was unlawfully detained. So this isn’t about some kind of barter. This is about international law.  Iran has accused Britain of seizing its tanker at the behest of the Trump administration, which is  trying to choke off all Iranian oil exports. The UK denies the allegation. A boat of Iranian Revolutionary Guard sails next to Stena ImperoMr Raab also urged Western allies not to engage in a “geopolitical EU versus US tussle” over plans for competing naval missions in the Persian Gulf to protect shipping. While Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, proposed a European naval operation Mr Raab has said that any EU initiative will need American support to be viable.  France and Germany have insisted the initiative be independent of American naval operations in the Gulf, which they see as part of Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran. “We want to see a European-led approach but in reality it shouldn’t be some kind of geopolitical EU versus US tussle,” Mr Raab said. “I think it would be important for the European-led initiative to have US support to make it viable.” Britain now has two warships in the Persian Gulf to escort British ships as they pass through the Strait of Hormuz.The HMS Montrose, a frigate, has been in the region for several weeks while the HMS Duncan, a destroyer, arrived over the weekend. The two ships will act in concert briefly before the HMS Montrose is due to return to port, once again leaving Britain with only a single warship in the area.Comment: Boris Johnson understands a simple truth – the better prepared we are for No Deal, the less likely it is to happenReappearance of cliff-etching tribute to Mussolini sparks row in ItalyBritain\u0026#39s youngest terrorist gets lifelong anonymity after lawyers argue he may become Isil poster boy if identifiedBrexit latest: Dominic Raab says Brussels \u0026#39isn\u0026#39t the only game in town\u0026#39 as he refuses to confirm if he will travel to European capitals as priorityChina says Hong Kong ‘will pay’ if protests continue in rare public statementComment: Cambridge University needs to tackle its institutional rape problemNarendra Modi surprise guest on Bear Grylls\u0026#39 Man vs WildIs it safe to visit Hong Kong?Vietnam seizes 125 kg of rhino horn worth £6m concealed in plaster shipment\u0026#39It\u0026#39s been pure insanity\u0026#39.

Wild.It will be broadcast on the Discovery Channel on August 12.Mr Modi, who claimed a landslide victory in May’s General Election, released a statement explaining he hoped his participation on the show would encourage Indians to care more for their environment.“For me, this show presents a great opportunity to showcase to the world India’s rich environmental heritage and stress on the importance of environment conservation and living with nature,” he said.“It was a great experience spending time in the jungle once again, this time with Bear, who is blessed with indefatigable energy and quest to experience nature at its purest.”It is the second time that an elected Head of State will join Grylls for Man Vs.

It was not immediately clear where the shipment had originated from. Rhino horn is especially prized in China and Vietnam, the two top consumer markets, where one kilogram can fetch up to $60,000. That would make the entire haul worth $7,500,000 (£6m). According to TRAFFIC, a campaign group against wildlife trafficking, the last decade has seen an explosion of demand for rhino horns, driving unprecedented levels of poaching that has sent rhino populations into crisis despite a ban on the trade since the 1970s. Only about 29,000 rhinos are now left in the wild, down from half a million at the start of the 20th century, report conservationists. The trade has been fuelled by beliefs that when ground into a powder, the horn can cure cancer, relieve hangovers or enhance male virility. The Vietnamese operation is the latest large-scale wildlife trafficking case in Southeast Asia.Earlier this month, three men caught trying to smuggle rhino horn from Vietnam into China were sentenced to a combined total sentence of 27 years in prison. Meanwhile, Singapore recorded a record bust last week of nearly nine tonnes of elephant ivory and almost 11.9 tonnes of pangolin scales from up to 33,000 pangolins.The contraband was found in three containers disguised as timber and travelling from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Vietnam. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The 64-year-old embodies everything we love to celebrate about British entrepreneurialism and commerce. And it’s a story like hers that would provide welcome relief from the tales of misconduct and poor governance – of arrogance and greed – which these days seem to dominate the business pages.McDonough’s biopic would be about ambition, hard work and a healthy dose of risk. But above all it would be about humble success: few jewellers can claim to have their pieces in the permanent collection of London’s Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum. Even fewer can say that their designs are favoured by several generations of royals. But almost none would be able to tell you all that without sounding even just a little bit boastful. This charming mother of two from Battersea is one of the few.On a muggy Friday morning in June, I meet McDonough in the basement of her eponymous flagship store, just off London’s chic Sloane Square. The term “basement” really doesn’t do the space justice. Carpeted in soft pastels, and with a huge sofa covered in cushions, the light and breezy room is a seamless extension of the shop upstairs, decor-wise. It serves as an atelier-cum-office-cum-lounge for McDonough’s team, and as I take a seat I can’t help but feel like I’ve been invited over to a very stylish, very classy friend’s house for tea.\u0026nbspMcDonough is a fifth-generation jeweller and her immaculate taste and eye for all things beautiful could have been inherited from either of her parents. Her father owned an antique jewellery shop off Bond Street and prior to having children her mother ran fashion shows at Paris’ Galeries Lafayette. Initially, though, McDonough didn’t seem destined for a creative career. After completing her A-levels at Queen’s Gate School in Kensington, where – she casually drops into conversation – she was taught English by Eliza Manningham-Buller, who later served as director general of MI5, she attended secretarial college\u0026nbspand took an admin job in the offices of Vogue.“I did what girls my age were doing at the time. But it was in the 1980s that I had what I call my lucky break,” she explains, sipping her coffee, long legs elegantly crossed at the ankles, and smiling at the memory a little coyly.Kiki McDonough on Symons Street at this year’s Chelsea in Bloom, London’s largest free flower festival in London (Matt AlexanderPA WirePA Images)“A friend of mine had an antique jewellery shop on Grafton Street in Mayfair. He called me up one day out of the blue and asked if I wanted to design and sell modern jewellery for him. I thought it was a totally mad idea, but my then-husband, David, encouraged me to give it a go.”And so, in 1985, Kiki McDonough the company was incorporated. In the founder’s own words, her first baby was born. With no design experience, she sat at her desk on day one, staring at a blank piece of paper with a pencil in hand. “I was clueless. The only thought going through my head was that this is completely bonkers,” she says with a laugh. But as it turns out, it wasn’t really as crazy as she suspected.\u0026nbspGavanGetty)The first pair of earnings McDonough ever designed – crystal hearts topped with gold bows – were inspired by an antique brooch she’d spotted in her friend’s collection. They now have pride of place in the permanent collection at the V\u0026ampA, and even though they were created some 34 years ago, their style is echoed in many subsequent collections, including those that have caught the eye of royals.In the mid-1990s, Diana, Princess of Wales, wore a pair of McDonough’s earrings to meet Barbara Bush. Over the last decade, scores of glossies have vied for snapshots of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, in McDonough’s creations. In March, the Express splashed a story claiming that the Duchess has over £47,000 worth of jewellery from the brand. But ever the professional businesswoman, exuding poise and grace, McDonough is not about to be roused such reports, accurate or not.\u0026nbsp“Of course it’s flattering that she likes my pieces, but what really gives me pleasure is when I walk down the street and pass someone wearing one of my items,” she says. “That unexpectedness – that’s what really gets me out of bed in the morning.”Our conversation mid-flow, I suddenly get distracted by an elderly lady in a striking suede coat with dazzling blue earrings who’s quietly entered the room and is now shuffling past us. I quizzically look at McDonough. “This is my mother,” she says with a touch of pride. “She’s 95 and quite deaf, but she works for me one day a week stringing necklaces. She’s always supported me. In 1989 she took over the shop when I had chickenpox.”From everything that I’ve seen and heard, there’s no doubt that while McDonough success is obviously her own doing, support from her friends and family has been paramount to her ability to stay resilient and devoted despite the testing ups and downs of running a company.Of course it’s flattering that she likes my pieces, but what really gives me pleasure is when I walk down the street and pass someone wearing one of my items. That unexpectedness – that’s what really gets me out of bed in the morningThough neither of her sons, now aged 25 and 27, work in the industry, she says that from a very young age she made sure that they understood what she did, and appreciated that it was her hard work that allowed them to lead a comfortable life. She also speaks fondly of both her ex-husbands and describes how fortunate she was to have found partners that understood and promoted her passion.\u0026nbspThe business has just had its most successful year ever and as questioning turns to the future, McDonough says she’s confident that she can continue to expand in the years to come. Beyond her Chelsea shop, she distributes through some of the best-known department stores, including Fortnum \u0026amp Mason in London, and Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus in the US. But it’s online where she sees the greatest potential for growth. Though the UK remains her dominant market, about 35 per cent of sales already go to the US and the brand has a strong following in Canada, Australia and Asia, predominantly because of the internet.\u0026nbspHer international resonance and success might be at least partly attributable to the variety of her collections. Many of her pieces are elegantly understated with intricate florals and delicate pastel hues – “jewellery for everyday”, as she calls it – but others are show-stopping, unapologetic statement features in radiant greens, reds and blues.That spectrum means that she’s loved by women of all demographics and backgrounds, seeking jewellery for all\u0026nbspoccasions. And while prices are certainly not cheap, it’s always been the business’s mission to make beautiful, high quality products available at a price point that’s affordable to as many as possible. Prices currently range from a few hundred pounds to several thousand.Why women don’t need a science degree to be successfulSpotify for textbooks: Inside the revolutionary new book shopAs the interview draws to a close, I can’t help but mention a delicate gold bracelet that I’d seen some months ago and then spotted again on my way downstairs to meet McDonough. “Oh yes, I know the one you mean. It would really suit you.” Of course she’d say that.\u0026nbspA few minutes later – my wallet a little lighter – I step out into a now sun-drenched Sloane Square admiring my birthday present to myself and silently vowing not to make a habit of bringing my credit card to interviews with jewellery designers in future.\u0026nbspBut Kiki McDonough’s charm really did win me over. There might’ve been a more economical way of finding whether she’s a good saleswoman too, but a little indulgence is sometimes necessary. I’m sure Kiki would agree.A View from the Top\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspDuchess of Cambridge\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The challenge has been limp indeed.\u0026nbspThere was no government or EU involvement in  Bank, which was once the little bank that could, with its free dog biscuits and seven-day town centre branches. It\u0026nbsprode a wave of goodwill when it was set up by Vernon Hill and Anthony Thomson. They promised a bank where the customer was king and\u0026nbspso it has mostly proved, with the bank regularly topping service surveys.\u0026nbspBut confidence in the institution has been dented by a regulatory foul-up and a spate of damaging rumours on social media.It has lost deposits and last week announced that profits had crashed. A big book of mortgages was sold and the search for a replacement for Hill as chair\u0026nbspis under way.\u0026nbspThomson went on to form Atom, an app-based outfit in the northeast, which recently raised another £50m from investors. The most recent accounts showed that it’s still losing a bunch of money and the prospect of a sale to one of its big backers\u0026nbsphas been killed off by Brexit. High-profile money manager Neil Woodford was among those who ponied up. His name on the shareholder register used to be viewed as a good sign. In the wake of the suspension of dealings in his\u0026nbspflagship fund, however, that’s no longer true.\u0026nbspTSB started off well after being spun out of Lloyds. It enjoyed a successful flotation and was subsequently gobbled up by Spain’s Banco Sabadell. But much of its early good work was trashed after it had its reputation shredded by an IT meltdown last year.\u0026nbspWilliams \u0026amp Glyn, the business-focussed bank that was supposed to emerge from RBS, never got out of the starting blocks. The bank ultimately worked out a deal with the EU to provide funding for existing competitors in the business banking space.\u0026nbspTesco Bank, meanwhile, recently sold its mortgage book and walked away from what has become a brutally competitive market.\u0026nbspThere’s really no common theme running through the difficulties these businesses have\u0026nbspencountered. Their stories really\u0026nbspjust serve to demonstrate how hard it is to get new banking businesses to fly when faced by four or five very big, well-established players.\u0026nbspFar from providing extra competition to them, the challengers are starting to find themselves being outcompeted. The ring-fenced retail banking arms of the leading banks, with their fat capital cushions, have, for example, stormed into the mortgage market brandishing cheap rates that customers have flocked to, HSBC in particular.\u0026nbspIt should be said at this point that not all smaller banks are struggling, a point made by Investec’s banking analyst Ian Gordon.\u0026nbspHe highlights the success enjoyed by\u0026nbsp“specialist banks”\u0026nbspsuch as OneSavings, Charter Court, and Paragon, which “are having a fantastic time”. But they are businesses which have become winners\u0026nbspby exporting particular niches\u0026nbspthat the big banks aren’t\u0026nbspvery good at serving. Full-service challengers they are not.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

The bank, as we know it today, was created by bolting together CYBG, the owner of the Yorkshire and Clydesdale banks that weren’t making particularly eye-catching progress before the deal, and the former Virgin, which was built from the good bits of Northern Rock Richard Branson bought from the government for a song. It had at least been growing at a decent clip.\u0026nbspTheir merger was a smart and sensible deal and there should be an opportunity for it to grow smartly from here. It just has to prove it can live up to its promise.\u0026nbspIt probably won’t worry the big five too much, but these days it’s looking very much like the last genuinely punchy contender capable of mounting any sort of challenge at all.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But rudderless Just Eat needs this as Amazon and Uber move inClick to followThe IndependentJust Eat told its noisy shareholders that a merger with Dutch rival Takeaway wasn’t on the menu when it updated the market in March. Now there’s a deal between the two at the door and steam is coming off the shares.\u0026nbspReports of something in the offing started doing the rounds at the end of last week. This morning the terms were announced. That’s some smart delivering.\u0026nbspWhat’s being served up is an all share tie up in which the two sides, who said no no no when activist investor Cat Rock Capital started banging the table and demanding something be done just a few short months ago, theoretically sharing the spoils.\u0026nbspJust Eat to publish hygiene ratings for every takeaway on appRestaurants on Just Eat giving ‘life-threatening allergen information’So Just Eat gets to fill the positions of chairman and the finance director, while the shares will have a premium listing in London. But Takeaway\u0027s youthful CEO Jitse Groen will run the business, which will be headquartered and domiciled in the Netherlands under the Dutch corporate structure.\u0026nbspHis colleagues are slated to hold two of the other three top executive positions.\u0026nbspTakeaway, a significantly smaller business in terms of number of orders, earnings and revenues, is clearly the winner. It’s eating its rival.\u0026nbspThis is a takeover in everything but name.Just Eat’s investors could scarcely be happier about that. The shares shot up by 25 per cent. Compare that to Takeawawy, which put something more like 3.5 per cent despite apparently getting the better of the deal.Part of the discrepancy can be explained by speculation that a counter bid may emerge for Just Eat, and it’s a realistic possibility. Partly it’s because Groen is well regarded and the deal gets Just Eat out of a real hole.It was much criticised for under delivering under former boss Peter Plumb. When his acting replacement Peter Duffy made it clear he didn’t want the job on the permanent basis, it wasn’t altogether clear where the company would turn (other than to Groen).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Company results usually come out at 7am, but by 8am on Friday, when the stock market opened, the results were still missing, all planned calls with the media and analysts were cancelled and a presentation to investors at the retailer’s London head office was scrapped.A spokesman for Sports Direct said: “Unfortunately we are still finalising preliminary results. We anticipate that our annual results will still be released today, with a presentation to follow.”The company then issued updates at midday and 2pm, each time saying it was still finalising the report.

After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.975 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1075 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea.

Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1275 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1475 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1575 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1875 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2075 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2175 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2275 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2475 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2575 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable.

Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3175 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3275 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3375 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3475 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3675 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3875 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.3975 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4075 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4175 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4275 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy.

Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4775 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4875 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 4975 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor.

George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5675 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport.

And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge.

Chris put his foot in it when he said he thought that a headline about two Islanders being meant for each other was about him and India rather than Harley.6975 Jordan goes on a kamikaze missionDespite having asked Anna to be his girlfriend only two days before, Jordan decided his emerging romantic feelings for India were too powerful to ignore. On the advice of Curtis, he pulled India aside and began to confess his feelings, before Anna stormed over ready to give him a piece of his mind. Was it worth it? Well, Jordan found out that India definitely just sees him as a “mate.” Ouch. It didn’t take long before Anna was giving Jordan a dressing down, joined by Maura and Amber who were equally ready to lay into the lothario. “You ask a girl to be your girlfriend and the two days later you were hitting on her?” Anna yelled. “It’s disrespectful for her to be sitting over there like a god damned mug!” Amber added. “You’re a f*cking liar,” shouted Maura for good measure. 7175 Curtis lands in hot waterCurtis caught a lot of flak for advising Jordan to tell India how he feels without speaking to Anna first. Aside from some harsh words from Maura, Anna sat him down and told him he was a “narcissist,” saying “you move like you’re such a good person, but you’re not”.Anna, Jordan, Harley and Chris were all dumped from the villa following a public vote. Although she seemed glad to leave Jordan, Anna left Molly Mae, Amber and Maura in tears after she told them: “I’m so grateful for you three, because I feel like I found love with you guys.”7375 The couples go on their final datesHelicopter rides, yacht trips and candlelit dinners... the remaining five couples enjoyed their final dates in this particularly romantic episode.

He didn\u0027t have much luck during Love Island, and even his relationship with Belle seemed pretty bland. But it was still a surprise – if only to him – when the couple were voted off by the public in the penultimate episode. We\u0027re fine, he\u0027d whispered confidently to Belle before the results were announced. Reader, they were not.175 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.275 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with.

Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge.

She didn’t seem too happy to be left with the consolation prize: I’ve personally really struggled to find a connection with anyone here and as you’re an expert, I’m hoping that you might be able to teach me a few things,” she said to Michael. “I think you’re a great person, and I haven’t really got any other choice.”6675 Chris and Harley get closerChris and Harley shared their first kiss after Harley admitted that “funny can laugh you into bed.”6775 Michael and Francesca leave the villaIslanders decided that Michael and Francesca were the weakest of the bottom three couples and dumped them from the villa.

On the advice of Curtis, he pulled India aside and began to confess his feelings, before Anna stormed over ready to give him a piece of his mind. Was it worth it? Well, Jordan found out that India definitely just sees him as a “mate.” Ouch. It didn’t take long before Anna was giving Jordan a dressing down, joined by Maura and Amber who were equally ready to lay into the lothario. “You ask a girl to be your girlfriend and the two days later you were hitting on her?” Anna yelled. “It’s disrespectful for her to be sitting over there like a god damned mug!” Amber added. “You’re a f*cking liar,” shouted Maura for good measure. 7175 Curtis lands in hot waterCurtis caught a lot of flak for advising Jordan to tell India how he feels without speaking to Anna first.

He didn\u0027t have much luck during Love Island, and even his relationship with Belle seemed pretty bland. But it was still a surprise – if only to him – when the couple were voted off by the public in the penultimate episode. We\u0027re fine, he\u0027d whispered confidently to Belle before the results were announced. Reader, they were not.There has been plenty for fans to talk about, whether it was the\u0026nbspLucie-Joe-Tommy\u0026nbsplove triangle right at the beginning of the series, to Tom\u0027s epic blunder when Maura overheard him telling the lads he wanted to find out if she was all mouth.Then there was the Casa Amor switch-up that introduced six new boys and six new girls to the island, leading Michael to betray Amber and hook up with Joanna, while Curtis broke Amy\u0027s heart when he admitted he had asked\u0026nbspJourdan\u0026nbspif she would couple up with him.Everything you need to know ahead of the Love Island finalFollow the drama in the penultimate episode of Love Island – LIVE13 relationship lessons we’ve learnt from Love Island this yearMore magical moments came during the meet the parents segment in the penultimate episode, which showed Curtis’s mum being physically incapable of saying Maura’s name correctly, no matter how many times her son screamed it at her (she kept saying “Moira”).Gifts were given: Amber got a clover necklace from Greg’s mum, which might bring them luck for the final, while Anton’s mum presented his girlfriend Belle with a razor – passing the baton, you could say – to shave his buttocks with.\u0026nbspAnd finally, Anton and Belle became the last couple to be voted off the show.

After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.975 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1075 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1175 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1275 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1475 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1575 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1875 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2075 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2175 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2275 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2475 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2575 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable. The public voted off Joe and Elma, ending the tumultuous relationship between the surfer and the sandwich maker (and leaving Anton single once again).2675 Anna and Jordan take it up a notchAnna and Jordan sealed the deal with a sensuous kiss, with Anna later rating the model as a 1010 kisser.2775 Arabella arrives – and immediately shakes things upAfter swearing to Yewande that a new girl wouldn’t turn his head, Danny was immediately smitten with fellow model Arabella after their flirty first date.2875 Yewande lays it on with DannySensing danger, Yewande made an effort to be more affectionate with Danny, kissing him in front of the rest of the islanders.During a challenge, a blindfolded Curtis accidentally rated Arabella a 1010 kisser, while giving his half-girlfriend Amy a measly seven. Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3175 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3275 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3375 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3475 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3675 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3875 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.3975 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4075 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4175 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4275 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy. Smitten with Danny, Jourdan politely brushed him off: “Stay loyal to the situation you’re in now, because I need you as a friend,” she said.Michael and Amber’s romance appeared dead in the water as Michael finally made his move on new girl Joanna.4475 Amy confesses she has fallen in love with Curtis4575 There were some awkward recouplings after Casa Amor…Amy was thrilled that Curtis had chosen to recouple with her – although she was soon to find out that he had made a move on another girl and told everyone that their relationship needs work. Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4775 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4875 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 4975 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5075 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5175 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie. After a few flirtations conversations with her old flame, she told Ovie that she and Jordan might not be over after all…5275 Curtis and Amy break upAmy was so determined to work out what had happened to suddenly derail her perfect half-relationship that she made a checklist to get to the bottom of it. But after a heartfelt chat, Curtis effectively ended things by telling Amy he couldn’t guarantee he would stay loyal to her. 5375 Maura reveals this years’ biggest plot twistIn a characteristically unpredictable move, Maura revealed to Lucie she had a crush – on the newly-single Curtis. “I want him to teach me how to dance,” she said, calling him “gorgeous”.Villa BFFs Maura and Lucie both grew tired of their Casa Amor romances, so agreed to tell the lads – as a group. George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5675 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5875 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy.

The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.975 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1075 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1175 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1275 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1475 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1575 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1875 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2075 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2175 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2275 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2475 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2575 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable. The public voted off Joe and Elma, ending the tumultuous relationship between the surfer and the sandwich maker (and leaving Anton single once again).2675 Anna and Jordan take it up a notchAnna and Jordan sealed the deal with a sensuous kiss, with Anna later rating the model as a 1010 kisser.2775 Arabella arrives – and immediately shakes things upAfter swearing to Yewande that a new girl wouldn’t turn his head, Danny was immediately smitten with fellow model Arabella after their flirty first date.2875 Yewande lays it on with DannySensing danger, Yewande made an effort to be more affectionate with Danny, kissing him in front of the rest of the islanders.During a challenge, a blindfolded Curtis accidentally rated Arabella a 1010 kisser, while giving his half-girlfriend Amy a measly seven. Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3175 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3275 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3375 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3475 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3675 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3875 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.3975 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4075 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4175 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4275 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy. Smitten with Danny, Jourdan politely brushed him off: “Stay loyal to the situation you’re in now, because I need you as a friend,” she said.Michael and Amber’s romance appeared dead in the water as Michael finally made his move on new girl Joanna.4475 Amy confesses she has fallen in love with Curtis4575 There were some awkward recouplings after Casa Amor…Amy was thrilled that Curtis had chosen to recouple with her – although she was soon to find out that he had made a move on another girl and told everyone that their relationship needs work. Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4775 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4875 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 4975 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5075 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5175 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie. After a few flirtations conversations with her old flame, she told Ovie that she and Jordan might not be over after all…5275 Curtis and Amy break upAmy was so determined to work out what had happened to suddenly derail her perfect half-relationship that she made a checklist to get to the bottom of it. But after a heartfelt chat, Curtis effectively ended things by telling Amy he couldn’t guarantee he would stay loyal to her. 5375 Maura reveals this years’ biggest plot twistIn a characteristically unpredictable move, Maura revealed to Lucie she had a crush – on the newly-single Curtis. “I want him to teach me how to dance,” she said, calling him “gorgeous”.Villa BFFs Maura and Lucie both grew tired of their Casa Amor romances, so agreed to tell the lads – as a group. George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5675 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5875 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge. Amber was glad to hear it, saying: “So now I\u0027ve at least got something, I can\u0027t just sit and mope around because I know I raised his heart rate the most!6075 Anton and Belle hit the rocksShe may have shaved his bum, but Belle reached breaking point after a series of slip-ups from Anton. She wasn’t happy that he kissed Anna in the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge, and a confrontation ended in a heated exchange at the nightclub6175 Joanna and Michael say an awkward goodbyeAfter it was revealed that Joanna and Michael couldn’t stay in the villa together, their fellow Islanders chose to send Joanna packing. She was less than impressed with Michael after it became clear he wouldn’t follow her out of the door, refusing a hug and labelling him a “snake” for staying. 6275 Ovie kisses new girl IndiaOvie kisses new girl India on the terrace after stealing her from Chris6375 Michael finally admits he still likes AmberAfter spending weeks vehemently denying it, Michael eventually pulled Amber aside to tell her he still had feelings for her. 6475 Amber recouples with GregAmber was forced to choose between old flame Michael and new romance Greg. “It’s hard choosing whether to go with your heart or your head… it’s been hard,” she said, before choosing Irish rugby player Greg. 6575 Francesca savages Michael in her recoupling speechAfter Amber chose Greg, Francesca was left with only one man to choose from - Michael. She didn’t seem too happy to be left with the consolation prize: I’ve personally really struggled to find a connection with anyone here and as you’re an expert, I’m hoping that you might be able to teach me a few things,” she said to Michael. “I think you’re a great person, and I haven’t really got any other choice.”6675 Chris and Harley get closerChris and Harley shared their first kiss after Harley admitted that “funny can laugh you into bed.”6775 Michael and Francesca leave the villaIslanders decided that Michael and Francesca were the weakest of the bottom three couples and dumped them from the villa. Michael left on a good note with Amber, admitting he wasn’t “the nicest person” over the past few weeks and saying he was happy to see Amber getting on well with Greg. 6875 The Sidebar of Shame challenge rocks some couplesIslanders learned that newspaper headlines called Maura and Curtis’ relationship “staged,” that India was accused faking her affection for Ovie, and that “bored” Molly-Mae was accused faking both her love for Tommy and her happiness for Maura and Curtis. Chris put his foot in it when he said he thought that a headline about two Islanders being meant for each other was about him and India rather than Harley.6975 Jordan goes on a kamikaze missionDespite having asked Anna to be his girlfriend only two days before, Jordan decided his emerging romantic feelings for India were too powerful to ignore. On the advice of Curtis, he pulled India aside and began to confess his feelings, before Anna stormed over ready to give him a piece of his mind. Was it worth it? Well, Jordan found out that India definitely just sees him as a “mate.” Ouch. It didn’t take long before Anna was giving Jordan a dressing down, joined by Maura and Amber who were equally ready to lay into the lothario. “You ask a girl to be your girlfriend and the two days later you were hitting on her?” Anna yelled. “It’s disrespectful for her to be sitting over there like a god damned mug!” Amber added. “You’re a f*cking liar,” shouted Maura for good measure. 7175 Curtis lands in hot waterCurtis caught a lot of flak for advising Jordan to tell India how he feels without speaking to Anna first. Aside from some harsh words from Maura, Anna sat him down and told him he was a “narcissist,” saying “you move like you’re such a good person, but you’re not”.Anna, Jordan, Harley and Chris were all dumped from the villa following a public vote. Although she seemed glad to leave Jordan, Anna left Molly Mae, Amber and Maura in tears after she told them: “I’m so grateful for you three, because I feel like I found love with you guys.”7375 The couples go on their final datesHelicopter rides, yacht trips and candlelit dinners... the remaining five couples enjoyed their final dates in this particularly romantic episode. Tommy and Molly-Mae got serious over dinner, speaking about how they might even be ready to move in together.7475 \u0027Meet the parents\u0027In one of the most popular segments of the series, each contestant received a visit from members of their family – and got to introduce them to their respective partners. Cut to Curtis\u0027s mum being unable to say Maura (she kept saying Moira), Greg\u0027s mum giving Amber a shamrock necklace, and Anton\u0027s mum handing Belle a razor so she could continue shaving his arse. 7575 Anton and Belle get dumped before the finalPoor Anton. He didn\u0027t have much luck during Love Island, and even his relationship with Belle seemed pretty bland. But it was still a surprise – if only to him – when the couple were voted off by the public in the penultimate episode. We\u0027re fine, he\u0027d whispered confidently to Belle before the results were announced. Reader, they were not.Which couple was voted off the island?Presumably Love Island’s audience wanted to save Belle from a grisly fate, and so voted her and Anton off the island in the final dumping before the final. Anton has previous for being too cocky, so it was a huge moment for schadenfreude fans after seeing him whisper to Belle: “We’re fine… we’re fine” before Caroline Flack announced they’d received the lowest number of votes and had to leave the villa.\u0026nbspWhich couples are in the final?There are four couples remaining: Molly-Mae and Tommy, India and Ovie, Greg and Amber, and Curtis and Maura.\u0026nbspLena Dunham compares her past relationships to those on Love IslandFollow the drama in the penultimate episode of Love Island – LIVEThe TV shows to watch this week: From Love Island to Killing EveWho’s going to win?Molly-Mae and Tommy have been together the longest and are considered the most “together” couple on the island, which has helped couples win in the past (for instance, last season’s Dany and Jack).\u0026nbsp India and Ovie, Greg and Amber, and Curtis and Maura got together far more recently but that won’t necessarily hurt their chances. Ovie has a huge fanbase although his chemistry with India on-screen hasn’t been that great ditto Amber, who has arguably been through the most on the show out of any contestant. Being with Greg can’t hurt her chances either – fans are obsessed with his Irish accent. And while Curtis became something of a playboy in the villa, viewers are also keen on his relationship with Maura, who again is a fan-favourite. So really, it’s anybody’s guess.What time does the show start?\u0026nbspLove Island: The Live Final airs at 9pm on ITV2The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Due to the nature of this disorder, people with autism all have different experiences.As part of the new study, scientists tested the amniotic fluid from 98 people sampled from the Danish Biobank which has amniotic samples from more than 100,000 pregnancies. All four oestrogens were significantly higher in foetuses who later developed autism, compared to 177 foetuses who did not.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.NHS at 70: Pride and worry as free health service celebrates birthday Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nurses test the hearing of a newborn childThe waiting room is busy in Milton Keynes University HospitalOn Ward 24, two nurses work at the nurses stationIn A\u0026ampE, a porter rushes a patient through the corridorA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationIn the physiotherapy department, patients are treated in the hydrotherapy poolIn the physiotherapy department, amputees take a classA junior doctor is at work in the staff roomA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationAn inpatient has her hair washed by the staff hairdressersIn the audiology department, a mother watches on as her son is given a hearing testOn Ward 8, staff serve lunch to the patientsOn Ward 24, a patient waits on their bedOn Ward 8, a cleaner is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalNurses test the hearing of a newborn childThe waiting room is busy in Milton Keynes University HospitalOn Ward 24, two nurses work at the nurses stationIn A\u0026ampE, a porter rushes a patient through the corridorA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationIn the physiotherapy department, patients are treated in the hydrotherapy poolIn the physiotherapy department, amputees take a classA junior doctor is at work in the staff roomA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationAn inpatient has her hair washed by the staff hairdressersIn the audiology department, a mother watches on as her son is given a hearing testOn Ward 8, staff serve lunch to the patientsOn Ward 24, a patient waits on their bedOn Ward 8, a cleaner is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalIt was previously thought that testosterone\u0026nbspwas linked to autism, but scientists say that oestrogen has an even stronger link.\u0026nbsp“This new finding supports the idea that increased prenatal sex steroid hormones are one of the potential causes for the condition,” said lead researcher Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, Director of the Autism Research Centre at the University of Cambridge.“Genetics is well established as another, and these hormones likely interact with genetic factors to affect the developing foetal brain.”Scientists say the find is particularly exciting because the role of oestrogen in autism has hardly been studied, according to the paper published in\u0026nbspMolecular Psychiatry.Dr Alexa Pohl, part of the Cambridge team, said: “We hope that we can learn more about how they contribute to foetal brain development in further experiments. We still need to see whether the same result holds true in autistic females.”It is the latest theory to support the prenatal sex steroid theory of autism which was first proposed 20 years ago.\u0026nbspIt follows 2015 research in which scientists from the University of Cambridge and the State Serum Institute in Denmark measured the levels of four prenatal steriod hormones in the amniotic fluid in the womb.\u0026nbspAutistic child delights orchestra with reaction to performanceResearchers found that two of these hormones, known as androgens, were higher in male foetuses who went on to develop autism. These androgens are produced in higher quantities in male than female foetuses which could explain why autism is seen more often in boys.\u0026nbspProfessor Baron Cohen warned that the findings cannot and should not be used to screen for autism. “We are interested in understanding autism, not preventing it,” said Professor Cohen.Dr Arieh Cohen, the biochemist on the team, based at the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen, said: “This is a terrific example of how a unique biobank set up 40 years ago is still reaping scientific fruit today in unimagined ways, through international collaboration.”Dr James Findon from King’s College London, who was not involved in the research, said: “This a scientifically robust study, but we need to see replication in an independent cohort to really trust the results.\u0026nbsp“There is hardly any work on prenatal oestrogen in autism, so while this is a good first step, we have to be cautious and not get carried away.\u0026nbsp“It is unknown exactly how prenatal sex steroid hormones may impact neurodevelopment. But this study lays the groundwork for future studies to investigate this relationship further.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Another flame flew out of the top of the rocket, as can be seen on the video.The rocket itself appeared to survive without problems, but it is just the latest in a run of issues. It came a week after the Starhopper craft flew a fireball out of its bottom during another test.It was the first time that SpaceX has allowed one of the tests to be streamed.

Company results usually come out at 7am, but by 8am on Friday, when the stock market opened, the results were still missing, all planned calls with the media and analysts were cancelled and a presentation to investors at the retailer’s London head office was scrapped.A spokesman for Sports Direct said: “Unfortunately we are still finalising preliminary results. We anticipate that our annual results will still be released today, with a presentation to follow.”The company then issued updates at midday and 2pm, each time saying it was still finalising the report.

I never took the next step to run scenes with her.”Created with Sketch.34 actors who regret big roles Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Viola Davis was nominated for an Oscar for The Help. Yet, the actor deeply regretted playing the maid Aibileen Clark, saying her character’s voice is not heard enough in the final film. Have I ever done roles that I\u0027ve regretted? I have, and The Help is on that list, she told The New York Times. I want to know what it feels like to work for white people and to bring up children in 1963, I want to hear how you really feel about it. I never heard that in the course of the movie.”The Transformers franchise may have grossed billions of dollars at the box-office, but critics have never looked kindly upon the films. Neither has Megan Fox, who told Entertainment Weekly that “people are well aware that this is not a movie about acting”. She also previously took aim at director Michael Bay, saying: “He wants to be like Hitler on his sets, and he is, so he\u0027s a nightmare to work for.” Fox later retracted the comment, calling it “righteous anger” that should have not been made public. Knocked Up remains one of Katherine Heigl’s best-known roles, despite the actor having said she found the whole thing “a little sexist. It paints the women as shrews, as humourless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys,” she told Vanity Fair. It exaggerated the characters, and I had a hard time with it, on some days.Few people knew who Idris Elba was before The Wire. Despite the acclaim that came from playing Stringer Bell on the hugely popular crime show, Elba has some regrets. We\u0027re all idolising Stringer Bell, but who are we really idolising? he asked David Lammy while appearing on James O’Brien’s podcast. Are we idolising a smart drug dealer or a dumb narcotics dealer? What are we saying here? Is it OK to pump a community full of heroin but because you\u0027re smart at it, that makes you cool? That was a problem for me.There are famously seven cuts of Blade Runner. One of those features Harrison Ford’s character, Rick Deckard, narrating scenes. Another – the one director Ridley Scott approves of – is bleaker and does not have Deckard explaining events. Ford does not care for either version. I didn\u0027t like the movie one way or the other, with or without,” he said in 2017, before the release of Blade Runner 2049. “I played a detective who did not have any detecting to do. In terms of how I related to the material, I found it very difficult. There was stuff that was going on that was really nuts.For a time, many people were not sure whether Daniel Craig would return as James Bond for the 25th film in the series. I\u0027d rather break this glass and slash my wrists,” he told Time Out of returning to the role. “No, not at the moment. Not at all. That\u0027s fine. I\u0027m over it at the moment. We\u0027re done. All I want to do is move on. Apparently a big enough pay cheque got him back in the tuxedo. I\u0027ll be honest, I f**king hate that movie,” Channing Tatum said of GI Joe. “I was pushed into doing it. The script wasn’t any good. And I didn’t want to do something that I – that I was a fan of since I was a kid and watched every morning growing up – and didn\u0027t want to do something that was, one, bad. And two, I just didn’t know if I wanted to be GI Joe.Most actors who regret taking on roles would wait a few years until publicly bemoaning their experience on set. Not Robert Pattinson. Before the final Twilight film was in cinemas, the actor said of playing the vampire heartthrob Edward Cullen: It’s weird kind of representing something you don\u0027t particularly like. A few weeks later, he added how he would have “mindlessly hated the series had he not appeared in it.While superhero movies may now be Oscar Best Picture contenders (Black Panther), there was a time when playing a dex-wearing vigilante was anything but prestigious. Jessica Alba was one of the first people to jump on the superhero boom of the mid-Noughties, playing Invisible Woman in Fantastic Four. The experience, though, left her wanting to quit acting altogether. I hated it. I really hated, she told Elle. I remember when I was dying in Silver Surfer. The director was like, \u0027It looks too real. It looks too painful. Can you be prettier when you cry? Cry pretty, Jessica\u0027.Ryan Reynolds has never watched Green Lantern all the way through. That has not stopped the actor being highly critical of the superhero role, going as far as having Deadpool – who he later played – shoot a fictional version of himself in the head for taking on the role. Ouch.Kate Winslet does not mind Titanic as a film. Her performance as Rose is a completely different matter. Every single scene, I\u0027m like \u0027really, really? You did it like that? Oh my God’. Even my American accent, I can\u0027t listen to it. It\u0027s awful, she told the . Hopefully it\u0027s so much better now. It sounds terribly self-indulgent but actors do tend to be very self-critical. I have a hard time watching any of my performances, but watching Titanic I was just like, \u0027Oh God, I want to do that again.\u0027“I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was,” Michelle Pfeiffer said of the sequel to Grease. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better. Thankfully, Pfeiffer\u0027s nose for a good script improved rapidly, with her next film being Brian De Palma\u0027s cult classic Scarface. Halle Berry remains one of the few actors to accept her Golden Raspberry award in person. Thank you so much. I never in my life thought I would be up here,” she told the audience, before spoofing her own Oscar acceptance speech and thanking her manager. He loves me so much that he convinces me to do projects even when he knows that it is shit. Meeeeeow. 1434 Christopher Plummer – The Sound of MusicThe Sound of Music remains one of the most beloved films of all time. Christopher Plummer, though, hated playing Captain von Trapp. “I think the part in The Sound of Music was the toughest,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “Because it was so awful and sentimental and gooey. You had to work terribly hard to try and infuse some miniscule bit of humour into it.”Another big-name actor who regrets taking on a mid-Noughties superhero role. Ben Affleck has remained an ardent Daredveil detractor. Daredevil didn\u0027t work at all, the actor told Entertainment Weekly in 2007. “If I wanted to go viral, I would be less polite. That was before people realised you could make these movies and make them well. There was a cynical sense of ‘put a red leather outfit on a guy, have him run around, hunt some bad guys, and cash the cheque’.”1634 Sylvester Stallone – Stop, or Mom Will ShootOne of Hollywood’s many iconic actors, Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered for both the Rocky and Rambo films. Less so Stop, or Mom Will Shoot, the 1992 buddy-cop comedy that teamed Stallone up with Estelle Getty. Speaking about the film in 2006, he called it “maybe one of the worst films in the entire solar system, including alien productions we’ve never seen.”1734 Sarah Jessica Parker – Sex and the City 2Although Sarah Jessica Parker will forever be best known for playing Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City, that does not mean she’s not open to criticising the second film. I can see where we fell short,” she told an audience at Vulture festival. “I understand, I actually get it. I will say, I also understand how much frickin’ money it made. I feel like that is forgotten in the discussion.” Paul Newman had high standards. So much so that, before the release of The Silver Chalice, the Oscar-winning actor took out adverts in the trade press urging people to not watch the television broadcast of the film. He later called it “the worst motion picture produced during the 1950s.Few actors are quite as straight talking as Colin Farrell, who said of the 2006 blockbuster Miami Vice: Miami Vice? I didn\u0027t like it so much. I thought it was style over substance and I accept a good bit of the responsibility.”There are many films Brad Pitt could arguably regret making (the awful 1992 flick Cool World comes to mind), but speaking to Newsweek in 1997, the actor decided to criticise The Devil’s Own. He called the film a disaster and the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking, if you can even call it that, that I\u0027ve ever seen.Following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Jim Carrey distanced himself from the violent Kick Ass sequel. “I did Kick Ass a month before Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence,” he wrote on Twitter. “My apologies”.Most people know Zac Efron as Troy Bolton from High School Musical. Zac Efron, though, wishes you knew him for something else. “I step back and look at myself and I still want to kick that guy’s ass sometimes, he told Men\u0027s Fitness. He’s done some kind of cool things with some cool people – he did that one thing that was funny – but, I mean, he’s still just that f***ing kid from High School Musical.2334 Shia LaBeouf – Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal SkullCharlize Theron may be one of the most acclaimed actors working today, but that does not mean she has not worked on bad films. One of those was Reindeer Games, co-starring Ben Affleck. “Reindeer Games. That was a bad, bad, bad movie,” she told Esquire in 2007. “But even though the movie might suck, I got to work with John Frankenheimer. I wasn’t lying to myself – that’s why I did it.”The Amazing Spider-Man series, starring Andrew Garfield as the eponymous web-slinger, was supposed to launch a cinematic universe to match the Avengers. There were even rumours of an Aunt May film entering production. Not that the actor who played Aunt May, Sally Field, would have been thrilled by that. “It’s really hard to find a three-dimensional character in it,” she told Howard Stern of playing the character, “and you work it as much as you can, but you can’t put 10 pounds of s**t in a five-pound bag.”Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, Adam West – some of Hollywood’s best actors have played the Caped Crusader on screen. However, only one wore a suit with Batnipples: George Clooney. “Let me just say that I’d actually thought I’d destroyed the franchise until somebody else brought it back years later and changed it,” he said of the role. “I thought at the time that this was going to be a very good career move. It wasn’t.”2734 Daniel Radcliffe – Harry Potter and the Half Blood PrinceDirector David Gordon Green, Danny McBride and James Franco struck gold with their stoner-comedy Pineapple Express. Unfortunately, their attempt to make another laugh-out-loud film, Your Highness, was a mess. Your Highness? That movie sucks, Franco told GQ. You can\u0027t get around that.Matt Damon’s original Bourne trilogy won plaudits from critics around the world, with the second instalment featuring on The Independent’s “Films to watch before you die” list. The actor, though, has spoken unkindly about the third film, The Bourne Ultimatum, saying the original script, written by director Tony Gilroy, was awful. It\u0027s really the studio\u0027s fault for putting themselves in that position, Damon told GQ. I don\u0027t blame Tony for taking a boatload of money and handing in what he handed in. It\u0027s just that it was unreadable. This is a career-ender. I mean, I could put this thing up on eBay and it would be game over for that dude. It\u0027s terrible. It\u0027s really embarrassing. He was having a go, basically, and he took his money and left.“It\u0027s the worst film I have ever made,” the former Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said of the fantasy film Red Sonja. “When my kids get out of line, they\u0027re sent to their rooms and forced to watch Red Sonja 10 times. I never had too much trouble with them.3234 Alec Baldwin – Rock of AgesThere are some actors who know they’re making a disaster midway through production. “It was a complete disaster,” Alec Baldwin told The Wrap when asked about Rock of Ages. “A week in you go, ‘Oh God, what have I done?\u0027”Bill Murray only voiced the beloved cat Garfield because of a misunderstanding: he thought Joel Coen, of the Coen brothers fame, had written the script. In fact, Joel Cohen, whose filmography includes Cheaper by the Dozen, Toy Story, and Monster Mash: The Movie, had. I was exhausted, soaked with sweat, and the lines got worse and worse. And I said, \u0027Okay, you better show me the whole rest of the movie, so we can see what we\u0027re dealing with,\u0027 he told GQ. So I sat down and watched the whole thing, and I kept saying, \u0027Who the hell cut this thing? Who did this? What the f*** was Coen thinking?\u0027 And then they explained it to me: it wasn\u0027t written by that Joel Coen.Even for video-game adaptations, Super Mario Bros, released in 1993, was a particularly strange film. Asked by , What is the worst job you\u0027ve done? What has been your biggest disappointment? and If you could edit your past, what would you change? the actor had only one answer: Super Mario Brothers.Viola Davis was nominated for an Oscar for The Help. Yet, the actor deeply regretted playing the maid Aibileen Clark, saying her character’s voice is not heard enough in the final film. Have I ever done roles that I\u0027ve regretted? I have, and The Help is on that list, she told The New York Times. I want to know what it feels like to work for white people and to bring up children in 1963, I want to hear how you really feel about it. I never heard that in the course of the movie.”The Transformers franchise may have grossed billions of dollars at the box-office, but critics have never looked kindly upon the films. Neither has Megan Fox, who told Entertainment Weekly that “people are well aware that this is not a movie about acting”. She also previously took aim at director Michael Bay, saying: “He wants to be like Hitler on his sets, and he is, so he\u0027s a nightmare to work for.” Fox later retracted the comment, calling it “righteous anger” that should have not been made public. Knocked Up remains one of Katherine Heigl’s best-known roles, despite the actor having said she found the whole thing “a little sexist. It paints the women as shrews, as humourless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys,” she told Vanity Fair. It exaggerated the characters, and I had a hard time with it, on some days.Few people knew who Idris Elba was before The Wire. Despite the acclaim that came from playing Stringer Bell on the hugely popular crime show, Elba has some regrets. We\u0027re all idolising Stringer Bell, but who are we really idolising? he asked David Lammy while appearing on James O’Brien’s podcast. Are we idolising a smart drug dealer or a dumb narcotics dealer? What are we saying here? Is it OK to pump a community full of heroin but because you\u0027re smart at it, that makes you cool? That was a problem for me.There are famously seven cuts of Blade Runner. One of those features Harrison Ford’s character, Rick Deckard, narrating scenes. Another – the one director Ridley Scott approves of – is bleaker and does not have Deckard explaining events. Ford does not care for either version. I didn\u0027t like the movie one way or the other, with or without,” he said in 2017, before the release of Blade Runner 2049. “I played a detective who did not have any detecting to do. In terms of how I related to the material, I found it very difficult. There was stuff that was going on that was really nuts.For a time, many people were not sure whether Daniel Craig would return as James Bond for the 25th film in the series. I\u0027d rather break this glass and slash my wrists,” he told Time Out of returning to the role. “No, not at the moment. Not at all. That\u0027s fine. I\u0027m over it at the moment. We\u0027re done. All I want to do is move on. Apparently a big enough pay cheque got him back in the tuxedo. I\u0027ll be honest, I f**king hate that movie,” Channing Tatum said of GI Joe. “I was pushed into doing it. The script wasn’t any good. And I didn’t want to do something that I – that I was a fan of since I was a kid and watched every morning growing up – and didn\u0027t want to do something that was, one, bad. And two, I just didn’t know if I wanted to be GI Joe.Most actors who regret taking on roles would wait a few years until publicly bemoaning their experience on set. Not Robert Pattinson. Before the final Twilight film was in cinemas, the actor said of playing the vampire heartthrob Edward Cullen: It’s weird kind of representing something you don\u0027t particularly like. A few weeks later, he added how he would have “mindlessly hated the series had he not appeared in it.While superhero movies may now be Oscar Best Picture contenders (Black Panther), there was a time when playing a dex-wearing vigilante was anything but prestigious. Jessica Alba was one of the first people to jump on the superhero boom of the mid-Noughties, playing Invisible Woman in Fantastic Four. The experience, though, left her wanting to quit acting altogether. I hated it. I really hated, she told Elle. I remember when I was dying in Silver Surfer. The director was like, \u0027It looks too real. It looks too painful. Can you be prettier when you cry? Cry pretty, Jessica\u0027.Ryan Reynolds has never watched Green Lantern all the way through. That has not stopped the actor being highly critical of the superhero role, going as far as having Deadpool – who he later played – shoot a fictional version of himself in the head for taking on the role. Ouch.Kate Winslet does not mind Titanic as a film. Her performance as Rose is a completely different matter. Every single scene, I\u0027m like \u0027really, really? You did it like that? Oh my God’. Even my American accent, I can\u0027t listen to it. It\u0027s awful, she told the . Hopefully it\u0027s so much better now. It sounds terribly self-indulgent but actors do tend to be very self-critical. I have a hard time watching any of my performances, but watching Titanic I was just like, \u0027Oh God, I want to do that again.\u0027“I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was,” Michelle Pfeiffer said of the sequel to Grease. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better. Thankfully, Pfeiffer\u0027s nose for a good script improved rapidly, with her next film being Brian De Palma\u0027s cult classic Scarface. Halle Berry remains one of the few actors to accept her Golden Raspberry award in person. Thank you so much. I never in my life thought I would be up here,” she told the audience, before spoofing her own Oscar acceptance speech and thanking her manager. He loves me so much that he convinces me to do projects even when he knows that it is shit. Meeeeeow. 1434 Christopher Plummer – The Sound of MusicThe Sound of Music remains one of the most beloved films of all time. Christopher Plummer, though, hated playing Captain von Trapp. “I think the part in The Sound of Music was the toughest,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “Because it was so awful and sentimental and gooey. You had to work terribly hard to try and infuse some miniscule bit of humour into it.”Another big-name actor who regrets taking on a mid-Noughties superhero role. Ben Affleck has remained an ardent Daredveil detractor. Daredevil didn\u0027t work at all, the actor told Entertainment Weekly in 2007. “If I wanted to go viral, I would be less polite. That was before people realised you could make these movies and make them well. There was a cynical sense of ‘put a red leather outfit on a guy, have him run around, hunt some bad guys, and cash the cheque’.”1634 Sylvester Stallone – Stop, or Mom Will ShootOne of Hollywood’s many iconic actors, Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered for both the Rocky and Rambo films. Less so Stop, or Mom Will Shoot, the 1992 buddy-cop comedy that teamed Stallone up with Estelle Getty. Speaking about the film in 2006, he called it “maybe one of the worst films in the entire solar system, including alien productions we’ve never seen.”1734 Sarah Jessica Parker – Sex and the City 2Although Sarah Jessica Parker will forever be best known for playing Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City, that does not mean she’s not open to criticising the second film. I can see where we fell short,” she told an audience at Vulture festival. “I understand, I actually get it. I will say, I also understand how much frickin’ money it made. I feel like that is forgotten in the discussion.” Paul Newman had high standards. So much so that, before the release of The Silver Chalice, the Oscar-winning actor took out adverts in the trade press urging people to not watch the television broadcast of the film. He later called it “the worst motion picture produced during the 1950s.Few actors are quite as straight talking as Colin Farrell, who said of the 2006 blockbuster Miami Vice: Miami Vice? I didn\u0027t like it so much. I thought it was style over substance and I accept a good bit of the responsibility.”There are many films Brad Pitt could arguably regret making (the awful 1992 flick Cool World comes to mind), but speaking to Newsweek in 1997, the actor decided to criticise The Devil’s Own. He called the film a disaster and the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking, if you can even call it that, that I\u0027ve ever seen.Following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Jim Carrey distanced himself from the violent Kick Ass sequel. “I did Kick Ass a month before Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence,” he wrote on Twitter. “My apologies”.Most people know Zac Efron as Troy Bolton from High School Musical. Zac Efron, though, wishes you knew him for something else. “I step back and look at myself and I still want to kick that guy’s ass sometimes, he told Men\u0027s Fitness. He’s done some kind of cool things with some cool people – he did that one thing that was funny – but, I mean, he’s still just that f***ing kid from High School Musical.2334 Shia LaBeouf – Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal SkullCharlize Theron may be one of the most acclaimed actors working today, but that does not mean she has not worked on bad films. One of those was Reindeer Games, co-starring Ben Affleck. “Reindeer Games. That was a bad, bad, bad movie,” she told Esquire in 2007. “But even though the movie might suck, I got to work with John Frankenheimer. I wasn’t lying to myself – that’s why I did it.”The Amazing Spider-Man series, starring Andrew Garfield as the eponymous web-slinger, was supposed to launch a cinematic universe to match the Avengers. There were even rumours of an Aunt May film entering production. Not that the actor who played Aunt May, Sally Field, would have been thrilled by that. “It’s really hard to find a three-dimensional character in it,” she told Howard Stern of playing the character, “and you work it as much as you can, but you can’t put 10 pounds of s**t in a five-pound bag.”Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, Adam West – some of Hollywood’s best actors have played the Caped Crusader on screen. However, only one wore a suit with Batnipples: George Clooney. “Let me just say that I’d actually thought I’d destroyed the franchise until somebody else brought it back years later and changed it,” he said of the role. “I thought at the time that this was going to be a very good career move. It wasn’t.”2734 Daniel Radcliffe – Harry Potter and the Half Blood PrinceDirector David Gordon Green, Danny McBride and James Franco struck gold with their stoner-comedy Pineapple Express. Unfortunately, their attempt to make another laugh-out-loud film, Your Highness, was a mess. Your Highness? That movie sucks, Franco told GQ. You can\u0027t get around that.Matt Damon’s original Bourne trilogy won plaudits from critics around the world, with the second instalment featuring on The Independent’s “Films to watch before you die” list. The actor, though, has spoken unkindly about the third film, The Bourne Ultimatum, saying the original script, written by director Tony Gilroy, was awful. It\u0027s really the studio\u0027s fault for putting themselves in that position, Damon told GQ. I don\u0027t blame Tony for taking a boatload of money and handing in what he handed in. It\u0027s just that it was unreadable. This is a career-ender. I mean, I could put this thing up on eBay and it would be game over for that dude. It\u0027s terrible. It\u0027s really embarrassing. He was having a go, basically, and he took his money and left.“It\u0027s the worst film I have ever made,” the former Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said of the fantasy film Red Sonja. “When my kids get out of line, they\u0027re sent to their rooms and forced to watch Red Sonja 10 times.

There, he found Diaz.Ariana Grande reveals she has a tattoo is inspired by Jim CarreyComposer of tragicomic tale of Anna Nicole Smith opera: How popAt the time of The Mask’s filming, Diaz was a largely unknown model and aspiring actor while Smith had found fame as a Playboy model and face of Guess Jeans. Earning comparisons to historic bombshells like Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield, Smith eventually transitioned into acting, most notably the infamous Skyscraper, a soft-porn spin on Die Hard. Following years of scandal, addiction and a notorious marriage to the 86 year-old billionaire J Howard Marshall, Smith died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs in 2007.Diaz, meanwhile, would go on to become one of Hollywood’s most successful movie stars throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, with roles in films including There’s Something About Mary, Being John Malkovich and Charlie’s Angels. She has not acted since 2014, with actress Selma Blair appearing to confirm in 2017 that Diaz had retired.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Asked recently what she would say to her -year-old self she replied: Lighten up... and then the girl of  would say eff off.After studying law at Glasgow University she worked as a solicitor in the city before entering the newly devolved Scottish Parliament in  as a regional MSP for Glasgow.In  she ran against her close pal Roseanna Cunningham to be party leader and looked to be heading for defeat when she withdrew her candidacy to support her mentor Alex Salmond, who went on to become leader for the second time.The party ousted Labour in  and Mr Salmond became Scotlands First Minister with Ms Sturgeon as his deputy.She has a reputation in Scottish politics for being too serious - earning her the nickname nippy sweetie, meaning a prickly character who is dficult to warm to.She supports Ayr United FC.The independence referendum in September  was a crushing blow for the SNP as Scots voted  per cent to  per cent against splitting from the United Kingdom.Salmond quit after the result, and Nicola Sturgeon was elected unopposed as party leader in November that year.She also became First Minister, the first woman to hold either position.The following May the SNP made huge gains at the UK general election, almost winning a clean sweep as they picked up  out of  seats in Scotland.In May  she cemented her position as First Minister of Scotland as the party won the most seats at Holyrood, although it lost its overall majority.Forbes magazine rated her the second most powerful woman in the UK and the th in the world.Nicola Sturgeon is married to Peter Murrell, who is the chief executive of the Scottish National Party.They met when Nicola was  at a Young Scottish Nationalists gathering in Aberdeenshire.They began a relationship in  and married in .

Not the civil service nor the BBC. Not the House of Lords. Not Tony Blair and John Major and Gordon Brown. Not the Labour Party.And not the combined might of Bob Geldof, Gary Lineker and the bloke who screams, “STOP BREXIT!” in Parliament Square from dawn till dusk.Oh how they all loathed Brexit and everyone who voted for it! They truly believed that those of us who voted to leave the European Union were all thick, racist bigots.There was never any real attempt to change the minds of the .million. There were only sneers, jeers and smears — and the full might of the British establishment committed to stop Brexit from ever happening.Brexit — a true Brexit — has not always seemed inevitable. There have been times over the past few years when the EU looked like the Hotel Calornia, where you can check out but you can never leave.But in the end, it did not matter what they wanted — the elite, the ones with power, the pampered factions of the British establishment, who are totally accustomed to getting their way.Because once the British people had made their democratic decision, Brexit was ALWAYS going to happen in the end.It is more than three years since the nation decided to leave the European Union.But it is only a matter of days that we have had a Prime Minister who actually believes in Brexit.Boris has electried Britain with his vision of a bright, shining future for our country outside of the  rotting EU empire.My heart says Prime Minister Johnson will get Brexit done. So do the bookies.He will probably need a General Election before Christmas to shake up the Parliamentary numbers, but Boris will make it happen.ButBoris can’t do it, then somebody  will make Brexit happen.Brexit is bigger than Boris. Democracy is more important than any one politician.And let the record state: It would have worked the other way around.If the British people had decided in the summer of  that we were staying in the European Union, then no amount of bitching from Brussels-loathing old gits such as myself would have mattered a damn.We would have stayed in the EU for a generation. Our current national debate is not ultimately about leaving or remaining.It is about democracy. And democracy still matters here.Democracy is deep in the British DNA, far deeper than in all those European nations where they have the national memory of a jackboot resting on their throats, far deeper than in all those countries where they have been invaded, occupied and tormented by tyrants.That is why the British establishment, in the end, could not veto Brexit. Sorry, chaps, you can’t dial down democracy. You can’t cancel the will of the people. Not in THIS country.The people decidedIn the end, democracy would not be denied. They could not reverse, overrule or cancel a referendum result in a country that has not been invaded for one thousand years.The will of the establishment — all those ex-Prime Ministers, all those well-heeled big shots, all those Right Honourable members and ermine-clad Lords, all those BBC executives, all those crisp sellers and ex-members of the Boomtown Rats — did not matter more than the will of the people.There is a historical inevitability about this country leaving the EU because, quite simply, it is what the people decided.And no matter what the establishment may believe, the people in this country are not their servants.Our great country is a democracy.Now and for ever, the people are the masters.And that makes Brexit unstoppable.NEW Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson wants a second referendum  but admits she would still campaign to keep the UK in the EU evenwe voted to leave yet again.Oh Jo. You may be a liberal. But you are not much of a democrat.Now the cops have dragged Fadi out, kicking and screaming.The property has been secured but worried neighbours say that Fadi could easily get back in with  a ladder.Oh Fadi, you don’t need a ladder. You need a job.And to stop poncing off the generosity of George Michael.THE Conservative Party is now the true representative of the working class.Lefty loons sneer that the Tories are as riven by racism as Labour, that the anti- Semitism that is rotting Labour is matched by Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.But a political party that disliked Muslims would not appoint the son of a Pakistani bus driver to one of the great offices of state – Sajid Javid as Chancellor of the Exchequer.And a party that was inherently racist would not promote Priti Patel – the daughter of Hindu refugees – to Home Secretary.And what a joy to see Esther McVey – who spent part of her young le in a Barnardo’s care home –to the Cabinet as Housing Minister.We may have an Old Etonian as PM, but the Tories are the party of the people now.I AM starting to look forward to an autumn general election.The most devastating put-down that our new Prime Minister made in the House of Commons was the one aimed at John McDonnell.“The Shadow Chancellor!” said Boris, jabbing a finger at McDonnell’s florid, furious face. “Sacked by Ken Livingstone for being too left-wing . . .  sacked for fabricating a budget!”Like every bully who ever lived, McDonnell can dish it out but he sure can’t take it.Jeremy Corbyn suddenly looks more like a candidate for a care home than  Downing Street. But McDonnell could prove to be an even bigger electoral liability to Labour.If that autumn general election comes, the voters must look at McDonnell and ask themselves: Should I really trust a miserable old Marxist with my wallet Perhaps we should send that aid to countries that are not sending rockets to the Moon.Or better still, help the needy in our own country.THE new series of Strictly will be graced by another of the remarkable Mabuse sisters – Motsi Mabuse, Oti’s big sister, who is replacing Darcey Bussell when the th series starts in September.There have been fears expressed that the new judge might favour her kid sister.I can’t think of anything less likely.The three Mabuse sisters – Oti, Motsi and middle sister Phemelo – all danced their way out of riot-torn, apartheid-riven South Africa.They are all dancing pros to the core of their being.Bet your last sequin that Motsi will not do Oti any favours.HOW sad to hear that  Rutger Hauer has died at the age of .

He then took his own le eight years later.Given that one in  of the population identies as gay, this doesn’t exactly seem representative.And that’s probably why @FootballerGay’s account racked up so much support so quickly.The account’s profile said the player was a “proud gay man”. He posted numerous tweets saying his club had been informed of his decision to come out and had been supportive. He tweeted saying that on July  he would reveal his identity.But instead, the account was deleted a couple of days ago. And shortly before that, the bio on the account was changed to read: “I thought I was strong enough. I’m not.”Although his tweets had messages of support from people such as Gary Lineker, lots of other people doubted the authenticity of the account.That includes my husband, an ex professional footballer.His view is that these days no one, from other players to the club, would caresomeone were gay.He should know. He played with Justin Fashanu and says no one in the dressing room had a problem with Justin being gay and he wasn’t treated any dferently to anyone .Still, outside the dressing room, he was singled out.Just one example is the time the owner of the opposing team called him a faggot from the sidelines.Fashanusprinted towards this guy, who got so scared he locked himself in the Press box.Fashanu kicked the door down to find the guy pleading, crying and denying he said anything. Justin could look after himself. But that kind of thing took its toll.Although we’ve moved on since , hearing stories such as that does make you realise why some footballers might think twice about coming out.I don’t carethe Twitter account was real or not. After all, who someone sleeps with is none of my business. Butsomeone wants to come out to the world, it is a terrible state of affairshe thinks he needs to be strong and “brave” to do so.And the reality is that attitudes towards a lot of things have changed over the past couple of decades.I remember when I turned up at the Director’s Box of an away game when I first took over at Birmingham City Football Club in .When I asked where the boardroom was I was told that director’s wives go in the ladies room. When I mentioned that I was the managing director the old boy on the desk put his glasses on, looked at me and said: “Oh yes, you’re that woman . . . stay here and I will find out what to do with you.”Because, at that point, women where banned from entering the boardrooms.That was the first door I ever kicked down. So I know in a very small way how being the first and being dferent to everyone  in football feels.Nowadays I am proud to say there are so many talented women running clubs. And I like to think we have moved on enough that no one would bat an eyelid at a gay footballer.Still, the football world can be a fairly intolerant place for anyone who is anything close to a minority.Maybe it’s the case that until we create a tolerant, accepting environment and culture then footballers won’t feel safe enough to come out.But which will comes first: that . . . or, someone like this being brave enough to admit they are gay and face the possible backlash.Only time will tell.And what I’d really like to see is a football culture in which someone’s sexual orientation really is neither here nor there.DID anyone  wince looking at the photo of the man intercepting his girlfriend’s moment of glory when she was being awarded her degree – to drop down on one knee and propose I guess Edgaras Averbuchas saw it as a romantic gesture but to the onlooker it was just a bit, well, selfish.For a start it looked like he couldn’t bear to let Agne Banuskeviciute have her moment in the sun so muscled in. He attempted to eclipse her huge achievement and make it all about him.Plus, he put her in a very dficult position. I mean, whatAgne wanted to say no Why didn’t he just let her graduate and then ask her in the evening to marry him But also, Agne wasn’t the only person graduating that day – I wonder how everyone  felt about having their big day overshadowed by this big “romantic” gesture Sorry to say that this does not bode well for the relationship.And my advice to this young woman would be to run while you still have the chance and find someone content to allow you to be successful in your own right.[boxout featured-image introI LOVED reading about Mackenzie O’Neill, the -year-old from Canterbury, Kent, who found himself having a bit of a kickabout with Lionel Messi on a Caribbean beach – the stuff that dreams are made of for some kids.]This is the kind of memory that never goes away, but it’s not only children that live for a moment like this. My husband, himself a professional footballer, played on the beach with Diego Maradona about five years agoand he still can’t stop talking about it.[ boxout]KEVIN CASH, once hailed as one of Britain’s most successful property tycoons with a fortune of £million, was declared bankrupt last July with debts of £million.So it is no surprise that he and fourth we Carla are now going to have to make a few changes to their lives.But when you hear that they used to spend £,-a-month on groceries and “housekeeping”, it becomes clear how hard it might be for them to get used to bankruptcy and shopping, presumably, at Lidl.What on earth are they buying  Gold bars to eat Now they’ll be shopping in the bargain bin.As Arsene Wenger used to say about Arsenal’s performances: “One day caviar, and the next cabbage.”WHATEVER you think about Theresa May, no one could deny that she is driven by a sense of duty to the country.So it’s no surprise that she has shed a tear once or twice over the past couple of very dficult months of dashed hopes and disappointments.But what has struck me when she’s been caught crying on camera is how quick people seem to be to triumph over what they see as a sign of weakness.Meanwhile,a man in a position of responsibility is seen to show emotion or shed a tear, he is seen as admirable, noble and passionate.I mean, it’s one thing wearing one in bed, it’s another thing altogether wearing it in bed with a new girlfriend.But to do so on national TV Well, all I can say is, I hope he wasn’t in his socks as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I mean how do you choke yourself  It doesnt make any sense.There are reports someone came after him but that could just be because hes a paedophile. Those types of iniduals dont last long in prison.If Epstein is in general population or anywhere available to the general population I believe his le is in jeopardy.They will have to seal him down in the jail. But even there there are still people who can get to him, ultimately.Epstein has been locked up in the Manhattan jail ahead of a trial for charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls.He is accused of sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of minor girls at his homes in ious locations.Documents claim Epstein would pay girls hundreds of dollars to perform sex acts with him and would also pay certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused.Epstein was also arrested on similar charges in  but managed to obtain a lenient sweetheart plea deal in which he only served  months in jail.Now Kuvin speculated whether Epstein would even survive until his upcoming trial.He likened the Epstein case to the Profumo affair - a  British scandal in which politician John Profumo was forced to resign after having an affair with a -year-old showgirl called Christine Keeler.Profumo met Keeler through his friend socialite Stephen Ward who introduced many rich and powerful men to beautul women. Ward was subsequently put on trial for immorality offences - but killed himself before the verdict was announced.There are a lot of similarities between what happened in the Profumo affair and the Epstein case, Kuvin said.We know that Mr Ward, who was involved in that affair and the procurement of women for some notable people, was given bail and committed suicide while out on bail - so it’ll be interesting to see whether or not Mr Epstein attempts again to get out on bail andhe does whether he survives between now and the date of his trial.I also find it interesting that we had allegations as far back as then that there was apparently masked men attending parties with Ward - sex parties - among these circles of famous friends.Then we have Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein who are also circulating in these very powerful, very influential circles - it definitely shows the underbelly of the rich and famous and what they do in their private lives for entertainment.These sex parties and orgies and odd things dating back even to the s and s - seem to be repeating themselves on a grand scale.The rich and powerful think they are beyond the law and they end up doing things that are beyond the law. You can see it with the Profumo affair and you can see it here. - Charged with multiple counts of unlawful sexual acts with a minor. - Epstein’s lawyers put together a plea deal for Epstein, who was the .He agreed to plead guilty to two felony prostitution charges in state court,In exchange, he and his accomplices received immunity from federal sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for le. - Appears in court to plead guilty on two lesser counts and sentenced to a  months in jail and was released early in July  - Arrested charges of child sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.Prosecutors accused him in a grand jury indictment of paying dozens of girls as young as  to engage in sex acts with him at his New York and Florida properties from  to .Pleaded not guilty and could face up to  years in prisonconvicted.More than a dozen women have now come forward with more sex abuse allegations"},{"url":null,"title":"pub facebook advert ex steak","story":"The George Pub  Grill in Stockton-on-Tees posted the question alongside a photo of a huge slab of meat on Saturday - sparking a wave of furious comments.It comes just two years after the same pub was rapped for a similar ad asking: Would you punch your ex in the face for a parmo The Advertising Standards Authority then ruled the words referred to domestic violence and was likely to cause serious offence.The George is soon to reopen after a fire and has promised to provide its most unhealthy menu yet when it does.Domestic violence campaigner David Challen, whose mum Sally Challen was released from prison last month after the Old Bailey ruled out a retrial for killing her abusive husband in a hammer attack following decades of emotional abuse, hit out at the County Durham pub.He wrote on Twitter: “So wait, he did this in , got told off, said sorry in a video and did it again recently  ”Punters warned bosses at the venue that another pub in Northern Ireland ended up having to close after pulling a similar stunt a few years ago but they simply laughed it off.Shona Cochran, on the pub’s Facebook page, said: “Pub in Belfast tried a similar ‘joke’ a couple of years ago.“They no longer exist. You are mocking DV and promoting violence.”But owner Craig Harker was unapologetic, replying simply: “Wouldn’t like to be that pub.”Mr Harker has defended the light-hearted post, telling The Sun Online: You cant say anything these days without upsetting someone.The Georges page appears to actively mock healthy eating and recently posted an advert banning rabbit food salad.It also offers free food to morbidly obese customers and puts on Man V Food style challenges.Responding to the ad, Facebook user Anne Morrissey wrote: “I get it’s all publicity but people are dying from domestic abuse.”Adele Knapp added: “Some people would take this literally not everyone would take it as a joke.Shadow Women and Equalities Minister Carolyn Harris blasted the advert and said: “This is totally unacceptable.We are currently taking the Domestic Abuse Bill through Parliament.A Bill that will at last provide some support and regulation for victims of Domestic Abuse.For this landlord to trivialise violence is both crass and deplorable.This must be stopped and appropriate action taken against the person responsible.In a full response, Mr Harker told The Sun Online he stood by the pubs marketing campaigns.This is about what someone would do for steak and the majority of the response is positive.Yes we get criticised by the PC brigade but you cant say anything these days without upsetting someone.We are the most caloric pub in the UK and we stand by our fantastic food and menu as well as the marketing campaigns.This isnt Weight Watchers,you want a cheat day or week then come

Paul Wells and Roberto Solari were senior employees at a logistics business in Surrey when they sent posts on a blokey messaging app. Sexist banter was exchanged, including speculative comments about the muff and private parts of two female workmates, Londonaposs High Court heard. The male colleagues were part of a group known as the old guard, some of whom had jokey nicknames for each other based on dferent types of coffee. Pornographic images were shared on the group and offensive comments made relating to female colleagues and, in particular, one woman identied in court only as D. Mr Solari - nicknamed Skinny Latte - had set up the group and posted a porn image of a woman exposing her vagina which was later tagged by another user with the message face like Katie Price and a muff like D, lawyers for their former employers Cathay Investments  Ltd said.  Mr Wells, , had posted a very graphic video of a woman performing a sex act on which Mr Solari had commented: D in a wig isnapost it  they claimed. The company the pair worked for was bought out in  and the new owners, Cathay, dismissed Mr Wells and Mr Solari in March this year. Bosses say they were justied in sacking them for gross misconduct, including the alleged wrongful disclosure of company information. The WhatsApp messages, which were subsequently discovered when another employee handed in their old work phone, also put them in breach of their contracts, the company says. Mr Solari, , is also accused of having used gambling and porn websites at work. But both men are now suing their former employers, denying any misconduct and claiming the reasons for their dismissal were trumped up in order to deprive them of the true value of company shares they say should be worth at least £, to each of them. They claim the laddy and degrading posts and comments stopped with the takeover and say the sole reason for their dismissal was for Cathay to avoid paying them the full price for their shares. The court heard that Mr Wells and Mr Solari had been senior employees of PNC Global Logistics Ltd, a shipping and airfreight company based in Egham, Surrey. The pair each owned a five per cent shareholding in the company when in January  it was bought out by Cathay Investments  Ltd, a multinational investments company, with a head office in Horsham, west Sussex.

Enam Ali, a Conservative Party donor, was arrested in a police raid of a Surrey restaurant, where A-listers like Johnny Depp and Pierce Brosnan have dined. Mr Ali, , is believed to have been released under investigation. As an organiser of the British Curry Awards, Mr Ali enjoys a high profile, and has mixed with Boris Johnson, Theresa May and David Cameron, the Mail on Sunday reports . He has also served on a Home Office advisory  on the hospitality sector, having been appointed in .  The restaurateur later lobbied then-Prime Minister David Cameron to roll out aposvindaloo visasapos, a scheme to bring workers from the subcontinent to fill staffing shortages in British curry houses. Surrey Police carried out a raid at the Le Raj restaurant in Epsom earlier this month.During the raid officers are believed to have seized documents and electronic devices. Surrey Police confirmed a person was arrested on July  on suspicion of modern slavery offences, and was released under investigation.  A source told the Mail on Sunday that the former worker claims he had to work long hours without pay, lived in poor conditions, was denied holidays and was kept on after his five-year visa had expired. The man is thought to have applied to stay in the UK on humanitarian grounds. Mrs May, the former Prime Minister, was a guest at the British Curry Awards in  and posed for photographs next to Mr Ali wearing a traditional shalwar kameez dress. Her successor, Boris Johnson, also attended.  Mr Cameron was guest of honour at the awards in  - the same year Mr Ali donated £, to the Conservative Party. Three years earlier he was invited to No , where he made the case for relaxing immigration rules to provide more staff for Indian restaurants. He was awarded an MBE in  for services to the hospitality sector.  Born in Bangladesh and migrating to Britain as a teenager, Mr Ali is a Brexit supporter who believes leaving the European Union will make it easier for workers from India and Bangladesh to get UK work visas. Since opening in the late s, Le Raj has attracted a host of star-studded diners, including Eamonn Holmes, Shane Richie and Chris Tarrant, as well as celebrity chefs Heston Blumenthal and James Martin. It is believed that Johnny Depp was so impressed by Le Raj’s onion bhajis that he requested a batch to take back with him to Los Angeles.

Iaposve seen people climb into the cavities in the rocks and the problem is that evenyou are able to move a rock to free someone who is stuck, another can fall into its place it can be a le or death situation.

Everyone is working together at the scene to keep him calm and safe.HM Coastguard previously said in a post on  Facebook : “Although the water has come in a fair way and the man is currently up to his neck, the emergency responders are on scene helping to reassure him and holding his head about the water.

He travelled more than  miles on Friday with his we, -year-old daughter, her best friend, and their -year-old son. But they say they were disgusted to find grease dripping down the walls of their chalet, rusty hobs, dirty floors and surfaces, cobwebs strung along the ceilings, and mouldy curtains.It was horrendous, Lloyd told Bristol Live .I wouldnapost even let my worst enemyaposs dog stay there, it was awful. I know you hear it all the time, but I really do think it was the holiday from hell.    We opened the door and just couldnapost believe what we were seeing, it was absolutely disgusting. My we was in tears, my daughter was in tears, the place looked like it hadnapost been cleaned in weeks. Itaposs not like I booked the room expecting the Ritz - we knew it was going to be a little bit rough around the edges, but at the very least you expect some basic level of cleanliness. We were told that cleaners go into the chalet at the end of every stay, but there were cobwebs up there that must have been there for weeks. Shocking photos taken in the chalet show cobwebs on lighting, grease marks on walls and mould on curtains. The family was eventually given a dferent room, also said to be filthy, and so eventually a third one was allocated.    A cleaning crew came out to do a sweep of the chalet and make sure it was clean, Lloyd, of Lincolnshire, said. My we and I were sitting outside when another couple walked over and said aposoh look, theyaposre cleaning our chaletapos. I immediately said that it was ours - it turns out they had also been given a set of keys for the same chalet by reception, who must have double-booked it. That immediately made me conscious about security - my son had brought his Nintendo Switch and we had a couple of iPads and a tablet with us, so right from the first evening it just didnapost feel secure. Lloyd believes he was right to be concerned about security - he said that over the course of the six-night stay a total of three couples were handed identical keys which could have accessed the chalet.    I didnapost want to risk it, so I spent a lot of the time near the chalet just making sure everything was secure, said Lloyd, who is disabled and was supposed to be enjoying his first relaxing break in eight years with his family after a long spell of health issues and the recent loss of a close friend. In the end I only managed to actually enjoy one day with my family, which was when we went to Weston-super-Mare to sit out on the beach. This was supposed to be quality time spent together, but as a result of the place being so dirty and insecure, it meant I was constantly on edge. On the sixth morning of the stay, Lloyd said his we woke up with a huge bite on her foot that became so swollen the family had to make a trip to the hospital due to their fears of a serious infection. The family eventually ended up leaving the holiday park one night early. Over the course of their visit Lloyd filled out six customer solutions forms - the first step of Pontinsapos complaints procedure - but claims he was not contacted at all until he got in touch with head office directly.

And now weaposre joining in. Sam Brook works at Sainsburyaposs in Bath and realised the scheme - which supports local communities through a wide range of initiatives put forward by each store - could help make shopping a far more straightforward experience for the  million deaf or hard of hearing people in the UK. That is why Sainsburyaposs colleagues turned their Bath store into a aposSignsburyapossapos for four days earlier this month.  With the new spelling applied to the sign above the door,  colleagues from the Bath Sainsburyaposs learned how to sign several common words and phrases when interacting with customers. That meant they were able to greet anyone at the door, askthey have a Nectar Card or even discuss the weather. This video explains the whole campaign:  We were so impressed by the idea, we decided to join up with the initiative and learn some sign language ourselves. In the video at the top of the page, you can see Daily Mirror columnist Eva Simpson getting a beginneraposs guide to signing from Sainsburyaposs Jonty Parry, finding out how to sign five key phrases that should allow anyone to communicate more easily with someone deaf. The speed with which Eva was able to pick up the phrases shows how easy it is to learn just a few useful bits of sign language - and how valuable that could be when it comes to having a chat with someone who is hard of hearing. About , deaf people in the UK use British Sign Language. British Sign Language isnapost a simple duplication of spoken English. It has its own syntax and grammar, and the order is dferent.  E.g. In English, you would say ‘What is your name ’ In BSL, you would say ‘Your name what ’There isnapost a universal sign language.  There are over  recorded sign languages.For example, American Sign Language is not the same as British Sign Language.  ASL alphabet is one handed, and BSL is two handed. In fact, there are so many dferent versions of sign language across the globe, you can here see how Happy Christmas is signed in  dferent countries!   Paul Robertson, the store manager at Bath, explained that was the exact idea behind aposSignsburyapossapos. “I thought it was the perfect time to use the opportunity to explore new ways to make our store more deaf-friendly, he said. We have many hard of hearing customers in Bath and always want to make their experience as brilliant as possible, and we hope Signsbury’s will help better their time in store even more.  The in-store drive to make the hearing-impaired feel more included is just one example of many initiatives being rolled out as part of the  Days of Community scheme. All , Sainsburyaposs colleagues are being given the chance to volunteer for a cause they feel passionately about in their local community. From community fundraising to hosting events and launching their own local campaigns, they are supporting causes ranging from community gardens to sports teams and elderly care homes. When in conversation with anyone deaf or hard of hearing, there are some very simple things you can do to make things a little easier…Relax Don’t panic!

Following last weekaposs roast which saw peaks of C, Southern Water is applying to the Environment Agency for a drought permit. The privately owned company, which supplies . million customers, made the move due to falling river water levels in Hampshire. If the permit is accepted, the hosepipe ban could be introduced for parts of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, thereports. This comes amid low water levels in local rivers after a dry winter and spring. Southern Water saidthe permit was granted bans would be carried out in a phased way, in specic areas which depend on the River Test for water. A decision is expected to be made by the end of August.    Karen Gibbs, from the Consumer Council for Water, said: It’s important to stress that people in the affected area would only be asked not to use hosepipes and sprinklers, which can use huge amounts of water. In the meantime we’d encourage customers to keep using water wisely and for Southern to do everything in its power to reduce the amount of water lost through leaking pipes – it should be leading by example. Southern Water said in a statement In June, we warned that flows in the River Test were falling. We said that under new rules governing when we can take water out of the river to supply to customers there was an increased risk of drought this summer. Last week, flows dropped to the point where we forecast that a drought permit may be needed to continue using the river – which is a vital source of fresh water for south Hampshire. This week we are applying to our regulator the Environment Agency for a drought permit that will permit us to continue using the riverflows go on dropping as forecast. Using a drought permit means that we must do everything in our power to reduce water use and so minimise the impact on the river’s precious and unique habitat.    The statement added: Butthe drought permit is granted we will be asking more of our customers by imposing TUBsin certain areas.If we do have to do this, it will be carried out in a phased way in specic areas which depend on the River Test for water and we’ll provide full details in advance. We understand this is disruptive and inconvenient but we’ve also seen our customers feedback that protecting the environment and the River Test is a priority for them too. We will continue to keep our customers up dated on the progress of permit application. There were threats of a hosepipe ban by United Utilities in parts of the country last summer - but this was later called off. Last weekaposs C heat has been followed by torrential rain and flooding around the country, and the Met Office has forecast more downpours from today. Highs will be just C for many. But the rain is expected to ease by Thursday and three heatwaves will follow – at the weekend, in mid-August and in early September, The Weather Company reports. Each hot spell will nudge towards C or higher.  Heat will blow to Britain from the Sahara, with C forecast in mid-August, said The Weather Outlook. The Met Office also forecast heat coming to Britain from the south during August.    Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Company’s Weather Channel arm, said: After the past weekaposs extreme heat, three more heatwaves are forecast in Britain this summer as air from Africa arrives. Each spell would reach at least C, C hotter than average. Next weekend has up to C possible locally, then mid-August is forecast a plume with above C and up to five daysapos heat, and a longer hot spell from the second week of September has a good chance of C. But there will be a wetter period in the August - week for most. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: Summeraposs gone AWOL, with a miserable few days for families on holidays. But the heat will be back later in the week and again in mid-month, when C is possible.

Two hours after witnessing the assassination of her husband President Jack F Kennedy, America’s First Lady Jackie Kennedy watches his successor’s inauguration while still wearing the pink suit stained with his blood. Her fixed stare shows she is in a daze. But Jackie, who was born  years ago this week, had clarity of thought to know she was making a statement to the world. Before joining the  other people crammed in to Air Force One to witness Lyndon B Johnson’s inauguration, she refused to leave her husbandaposs coffin and help to change out of her blood-splattered clothes.  “I want them to see what they have done to Jack,” was her steely reply. President Johnson’s we Lady Bird recalled there was far more blood on Jackie which the presidential photographer kept out of frame. She said: “Her hair was falling in her face but she was very composed. “Mrs Kennedy’s dress was stained with blood. One leg was almost entirely covered with it and her right glove was caked with blood – her husband’s blood.Somehow that was one of the most poignant sights – that immaculate woman, exquisitely dressed, and caked in blood.” Jackie had regretted not being seen with even more blood. She told of wiping her face before she boarded the plane and instantly wishing she hadn’t. Jackie said:  One second later, I thought, aposWhy did I wash the blood off apos I should have left it there let them see what theyaposve done.”    Appearing in the inauguration pictures bearing her husband’s blood meant Jackie - who had quickly grasped the power of imagery - reminded the world of the murdered President. Her refusal to change was not solely about sending a message. Jackie was in severe shock. At Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, while her husband’s autopsy was performed, she began to relive the trauma sheaposd experienced. She relived driving down Dealey Plaza in Dallas in the open top limousine on that sunny morning of  November , as she and her husband waved to crowds.    Jackie, who was  at the time, was still recovering from the August death of their prematurely born son Patrick Bouvier Kennedy when she agreed to join husband on the trip to Texas. That morning John had persuaded her to wear the pink suit, one of his favourites. She looked the picture of elegance and pose as she beamed and waved back at well wishers. But as shots rained down from Lee Harvey Oswald’s gun, the president suddenly fell forwards. Video footage shows Jackie jump up and reach to the back of the car, some felt to retrieve some of her husband’s skull. But Jackie had no recollection of that moment. She repeated what she could remember, over and over, to the people who had gathered to comfort her at the hospital and recalled laying her body over his protectively as she cradled him in her lap.    When priests declared her husband dead at pm, Jackie knelt on the bloodied floor to pray for him. She did not take off the blood stained boucle suit - widely thought to be Chanel, but actually a “line for line” authorised replica made in New York so the First Lady wouldnapost be criticised for shopping overseas - until the next morning. She did not clean the blood off and her maid tearfully folded it and stored it in a box. No one knows the whereabouts of her hat and gloves, which were misplaced in the trauma of the assassination and the the days following.  The box was later sent to Jackie’s mother who wrote a note simply saying “November nd ” and placed in her attic. It was eventually donated to the National Archives in Maryland, where is kept out of public view in an acid-free container in a windowless room. In  Steven Tilley, a senior archivist, told a newspaper: “It looks like itaposs brand new, except for the blood. Also held at the museum are Lee Harvey Oswaldaposs rle, bullets and bullet fragments from the shooting, the original windshield of the limousine, and more than five million pages of assassination-related records. But Jackie’s suit will not be seen again in this letime. Because in , following Jackie’s death in May  at the age of , Jackie’s daughter Caroline Kennedy signed an order that the suit be preserved but not displayed publicly until at least .

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes the limit for dancer jessica","story":"Janet WestUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith Highland Games season in full fling, one talented Ardrishaig dancer scooped three first places in three dferent events last week.Eight year old Jessica McCrae, a pupil at Ardrishaig Primary, was crowned winner in the beginners section at Rosneath, Inveraray and Taynuilt Highland Games.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":null,"title":"county-talent-fore-fringe-sea","story":"County residents are putting on a large number of shows and workshops over the  days.North Berwickrsquos own historian and author Ailsa Fortune, who will be presenting a talk on the Elgin Marbles, said: ldquoIt is encouraging that the Fringe by the Sea organisers include local performers and authors in their programme ndash itrsquos really good for the collective morale of this vibrant community.ldquoTherersquos always a great buzz about the place when the festival is in full swing.ldquoFor me personally, appearing at Fringe by the Sea is an opportunity to share my work on some of the little-known but intriguing East Lothian characters, like Mary Nisbet of Dirleton, whose lives have influenced our national history, and Irsquom hoping the connection with the Elgin Marbles, currently the subject of international debate, will stimulate lots of interest.Ailsarsquos book, Par for the Ladies, looks at the women who shaped the golfing legacy of North Berwick.

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

As the latest incumbent of  Downing Street settles into his new pad, Boris Johnson is already facing criticism for reportedly spending thousands of pounds of taxpayers money on furniture, including a bed.A new bed for Boris  It sounds like the title of a childrens book. Which is somewhat appropriate as a man-child rocks up to run the country.You can picture the scene in the furniture shop with our political Goldilocks trying out all the beds until he finds one that is \"just right\" as in the fairy-tale with the three bears. There is a joke about Brexit, BoJo and making your bed in all of this, but Im simply too weary to deliver the punchline.Lets say the image that springs to mind is a lumpy futon that has been chucked out beside the bins and peed on by a passing dog.Relax hellip dont do itREGULAR readers of this column will know I have a penchant for dabbling in what could be loosely termed topical lestyle concepts.

In fact, it is exhausting.Sample floating thoughts: \"Beautul tree. Fluffy clouds. Oh, a plane!

It is because of what has happened in the  months between the original consultation closing and this announcement.We have seen a massive increase in hostility towards trans people, and conversations that seem to indicate that a vocal minority are much more concerned with trying to reduce our existing rights and social acceptance, rather than constructive dialogue about gender recognition reform.Read more:Trans Scots suffering abuse in wake of GRA debateIt is our sincere hope that as with the Equal Marriage legislation, this consultation focuses on the technicalities.

The authors, Dr Kath Murray and Lucy Hunter Blackburn argue that in both cases, policy-makers, overly influenced by advocates for the rights of trans people, failed to consider how allowing people to self-declare their gender might affect other groups. ldquoThe analysis hows how decision making has been directed towards the interests of one specic interest group, to the detriment of another, women and girls, they state.Catriona Stewart:Trans rights questions in Yaniv male genitals waxing case must be answered in ScotlandA small number of influential actors appear to have secured a monopoly on how sex and gender identity are understood within Scottish policy-making.The report is not critical of the actions of LGBT groups in lobbying government. \"Lobbying in good faith on behalf of a particular interest group is a legitimate activity in a democracy,\" the authors state.But they claim government should weigh and balance the needs of all interest groups and this has not been done. An example, they say, is the failure to consider whether gender self-ID policies might be \"open to abuse by iniduals with malign intent, irrespective of gender identity\". The authors say \"there is evidence to suggest that failing to anticipate such abuse is naiive\".The article concludes that the Scottish Government should review the adequacy of its institutional safeguards against well-organised lobbying.A spokesman for the Government said the Scottish Government was developing guidance to help realise the rights of both women and trans people and Cabinet Secretary for Equalities Shirley-Anne Somerville had reopened a consultation on its proposed reforms to gender recognition laws.\"The Cabinet Secretary said the Scottish Government would consult later this year on a draft Gender Recognition Bill, and this would include a full Equality Impact Assessment,\" the spokesman added.Read more:Gender self-ID law could run out of timeBut the gender reform debate has been a contentious topic even within the SNP government. This continued last week, when the SNPs National Womenrsquos and Equalities Convener Fiona Robertson faced signicant criticism online, including from SNP supporters, after she described a controversial Canadian trans activist as a ldquofemale predator and said Jessica Yaniv should not be misgendered.Yaniv is a transwoman who has been pursuing a number of businesses offering waxing services to women, after they would not offer the same service to her, because she is male bodied.

No one with any understanding of violence against women and girls would say such a thing and it certainly isnt a feminist argument.\"She added: \"Of course most men donrsquot commit violence against women and girls, but that doesnrsquot take away from the fact that around  per cent of sexual assaults are committed by men as are most violent crimes.

That the price of oil has fallen and partially recovered is well known, but is it a resource of no real further benefit to Scotland  Consider the report in November  by Andy Critchlow, head of energy news for EMEA who, writing in The Dailysaid, without a single reference to Scotland, ldquothink what the UK would be like without the vast wealth generated by the equivalent of bn barrels of oil pumped from British territory over the past  years ndash there are up to bn barrels of oil still out there ndash North Sea oil should still give Britain the cash-generating power to defend its economy and the leverage to build new trading relationships overseas.Westminster wants us to believe oil is a millstone round our neck and there is a Scottish phrase for that: aye, right. It is unthinkable Westminster would set up a Scottish Oil Fund from oil and the vast gas revenues coming on-stream, especially as our new PM has the view that pound spent in Croydon is better than pound spent in Scotland. It is time to do it ourselves, they have had their chance and failed.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.THE letter by Robert Hoskins on the financial consequences of an independent Scotlandmakes some valid points, but not regarding the state pension being paid in a new Scottish currency.Current pensioners will continue to be paid in sterling .In fact, anyone still in employment with  years of qualying years will be treated similarly.Those with less than  years would receive a mixture of UK and Scottish Government pension.It would take at least a generation before a full Scottish Government pension, in whatever currency applies is paid.Jim McSheffrey, Gfnock.IN the House of Commons Boris Johnson askedScotland really wanted to join the euro, a currency which the Leave Campaign consistently dismissed as a joke during the referendum. TodayI bought euro for pound. Effectively the two currencies are at parity, whereas one could almost get euro for pound when the euro launched.I canrsquot help feeling that the euro joke is on me and I just donrsquot see what is funny. Perhaps Scotland should join asap. Maybe the poor English should do likewise. Things can only get worse.Ronald Cameron, Fort William.SINCE he took over leading the SNP at Westminster, Ian Blackford has used every exchange he has had with Government leaders to attempt to demean, insult, or be downright nasty to whomever he faces in the House.Never once has he attempted humour or wit to make a point. It has been the same mind-numbing and palpably phoney grievance-peddling, delivered in dead pan style, and antagonism, clearly meant to placate the zealots in his own party. He seems to relish in particular attacking the weak and wounded.Perhaps with a rumbustious new PM in office, ho will take no prisoners and gives as much he takes, Mr Blackford could try grown-up politics.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.BOTH Private Eye, as reported by Alistair Grant Brexit chaos in Commons\", The Herald, July  and Mr Grant are far too kind to Theresa May. Private Eyes blank page suggests she did not achieve anything she actually achieved much, but none of it worthy of praise.The ldquohostile environment for immigrants and the infamous vans with ldquoGo home emblazoned on them being driven through areas with ethnic minority populations hardly count as achievements of which any civilised human being would be proud. For a daughter of the church, they dont speak well of her Christianity.Mr Grant seems to accept that Mrs May kept her promise to end austerity. This would be laughable were it not so tragic for the victims. Figures published this week in Aberdeen show the continued rise in the need for food banks and the human stories of suicides resulting from the transfer to Universal Credit tell a very dferent story.I suppose Mrs Mays best hope, though not one to be welcomed by the rest of us, is that her successor so destroys livelihoods and social cohesion through his mad determination to tear the UK out of the EU, that herfailures fade into insignicance.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.WITH the usual sanctimony that we expect of the SNP, we hear time and time again that the party is against the privatisation of health care. And yet the SNP continues to use private hospitals to cut waiting lists, averaging , operations per year since . Perhaps instead of harping on about independence, Nicola Sturgeon should focus on ensuring we can all be treated timeously by the devolved NHS in Scotland.Jane Lax, Aberlour.Read more: Time to focus debate on the high costs of independence"},{"url":null,"title":"helen-mcardle-proof-last---cats-dogs-good","story":"In the face of what might seem like the impending doom of a Thelma and Louise-style exit from the European Union, the temptation to turn to wine, chocolate or simply despair is strong for many of us.Thankfully, scientists in the US have offered up a simple technique to lowering your cortisol level: playing with cats and dogs.Any cat owner struggling to get an unruly moggy into their box for a trip to the vet or retrieving a kitten from the top of a curtain pole might associate the experience with rocketing blood pressure, but research tells a dferent story.There is plenty of anecdotal evidence from people who praise their canine and feline companions as a source of comfort, amusement and relaxation. But the recently published findings of a study carried out at Washington State University show clear evidence of the mental health benefit to humans of pets.The randomised trial gauged  undergraduate students as they were split into four categories: petting cats and dogs looking at a slideshow of images of cats and dogs watching other people pet animals or being sat in a waiting room without animals where they were banned from using phones, reading or talking to one another - but on the upside, they were given pizza vouchers.The study, published in the American Educational Research Association, was set up to respond to evidence that levels of stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts have increased among young people at university, and that these iniduals are more likely to get poorer grades or drop out.The researchers measured the participants cortisol - the stress hormone. Saliva samples were collected each morning after the students woke up and again to reflect pre- and post-test cortisol in the dferent categories.The scientists controlled for factors which might influence cortisol such as sleeping patterns, exercise, caffeine and alcohol intake. They also graded each student on their existing levels of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms.The results showed that those who had hands-on interactions with cats or dogs experienced by far the steepest and longest sustained drop in their cortisol, indicating \"momentary stress relief\" had indeed occurred.Unfortunately, for those seeking a scientic answer to the thorny question, which is better, cats or dogs , the study draws a blank. Interactions with dogs and cats were counted as one category, although participants were actually allocated one or the other.The second-best results were achieved in the waiting room group - surely proof of the benefits of free pizza.So with turbulent times ahead, perhaps the Government should provide all citizens with a cat, a dog ndash or pizza "},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie aiming to shine for the community","story":"Judges will descend on Inverurie next week to assess the town for the coveted  Beautul Scotland awards.Inverurie Environmental Improvement Group has joined many others from across the country to celebrate more than  years of community improvement.The town is looking in fine colourful fettle for the judges arriving next weekAdministered by Keep Scotland Beautul - a member of the Royal Horticultural Society’s Bloom Federation - Beautul Scotland recognises the efforts of local authorities, communities and businesses which work tirelessly to improve their local cities, towns and villages.Entrants have together nurtured an astonishing number of plants, organised local environmental awareness campaigns and encouraged mass volunteer participation – all to improve the places they live and work in.Now the planters are blooming, the streets are clean and the community is ready to showcase its hard work to the Beautul Scotland judges.Three themes are examined during the judging - horticultural achievement,community participation and environmental responsibility - to discover which communities have been most successful in improving the attractiveness, cleanliness and sustainability of the places they care for.Winning communities will be presented with awards at a ceremony hosted by Dumfries and Galloway Council in September .The overall winner will be presented with the prestigious Rosebowl Trophy, while a number of discretionary awards will be presented for outstanding performance in areas such as bioersity, tourism, and community involvement.

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything. Something as simple as helping open a window or popping to the shops to pick up some sunscreen can make a huge dference to someone’s comfort and well-being.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

The Tories’ blonde bombshell, now more lithe with a spring in his step, more effervescent with the pop and fizz of a victor’s champagne, has brought his boundless positivity to the British premiership. The new PM has taken the field with a leap that even Bob Beamon would envy. In Manchester he announced how hundreds of billions of borrowed money would be thrown at Northern cities like the tickertape confetti that greeted theof Apollo  astronauts to New York. He did not cancel HS but instead pumped up the volume by promising it would definitely go on to Leeds and probably beyond. Likewise we can expect more largesse when he visits Glasgow, asit’s a lack of government funding that holds Scotland’s economy back rather than the SNP’s perverse policy priorities and an addiction to higher taxes.The result is there for all to see – an almighty bounce across a range of polls that gives great heart to Conservative supporters, be they Leavers or Remainers, and provides hope to a wilting public that the saga of Brexit may at last be settled. And yet some words of caution are required. The Prime Minister’s joyous enthusiasm has made the cup runneth over for far too many commentators who have imbibed his chin-up, can-do, best of British mentality. Some Andrews Liver Salts are needed, and when not available a cold bath is in order. The last time I looked the UK was still inside the European Union and its leaders are not yet talking. Despite all the shrill outrage at a far right take-over of government from easily offended opponents the Conservative Cabinet continues to have a signicant remainer majority of - per cent. Only two of its members, Priti Patel and Theresa Villiers voted consistently against May’s attempts at surrender. Thus a classic British fudge remains more likely than trading on WTO terms.After the litany of broken promises and open acceptance of scaremongering it is no surprise that even Labour voters can be heard to say the Johnson is a breath of fresh air compared to May’s halitosis-like pessimism. Just as many said May should be given a chance, so too all but the most bitter ideologues are hoping Johnson might just surprise even himself and escape from the EU straitjacket, undo the chains and swim to the surface of the River Thames he chose to jump in. Thus we have four weekend polls that all give the Conservatives a bounce of anything between  to  per cent, mainly at the expense of the Brexit Party. This was to be expected and exactly mirrors what happened when Theresa May gained ten points on becoming Prime Minister. But is that it  Will there be more gains for Johnson  He certainly needs them, for languishing at  per cent after a bounce is not enough for the Conservatives to win a general election. Johnson has to go further, he must be touching  per cent to be assured of victory and to do that he needs to deliver on his promise and take the country out of the European Union and on time. That means living beyond the jurisdiction of the European Courts of Justice deciding for ourselves where our troops are deployed in foreign adventures choosing who might reap the harvest from fishing in our waters deciding who can enter our country, what taxes and at what rates of tax we might levy what regulations even our domestic commerce must submit to and what barriers we must unjustly erect to keep poorer countries poor.Johnson needs more bounce – but what bounces up must come down. If he does not provide some semblance of achieving a real and clean Brexit on the due date then his bounce must reach its apogee and then fall, ing eventually to the same point from where it came. Those of my generation will remember those super-bouncy balls that when thrown down on the playground would rise like a rocket, seemingly into orbit beyond the roofline, only to falter and thento terra firma. Only by catching a bouncing ball at a point higher than from which it was dropped can the energy unleashed have been said to be beneficial. When to catch that bounce is the judgment of when to call an election and that requires a fine touch, not least because calling an election is no longer the sole prerogative of the Prime Minister.To strengthen his hand Johnson needed to assert himself over his immediate opponents and last week showed he relishes the fight. The Labour Party must be fretting from the mother of all drubbings Johnson unleashed on Corbyn and McDonnell during his statement to the House. Those glum faces behind Labour’s demi-Marxist leaders were undoubtedly thinking ‘we had better get ourselves someone new, someone optimistic and upbeat, someone positive and full of love and joy, but who and how ’ So long as the unions choose who reigns in the Court of the Crimson King then Corbyn remains our st century Schizoid Man, with his two political personas of socialist militancy or moderate avuncular grandad that are irreconcilable.Similarly a bruised Ian Blackford was given notice the SNP parliamentary leader needs to get fighting fit when he enters the ring with the big boys. If he still enjoys his Porsche I last saw him in maybe he should swap it for a Boris Bike  Theresa May tended to parry Blackford, but Johnson has no qualms of pummelling him into a pulp and enjoying it too. Only Nigel Farage will present an altogether tougher challenge, having already seen off the last two premiers with his cutting jabs, but that title fight is not anticipated until after Hallowe’en.With Westminster now on holiday until September, and then almost immediately breaking again for party conferences, last week’s theatre will work for Johnson in the short term but eventually he must face the demons namely his promise to leave the EU at the end of October – and without a dealthat’s what it takes.Failure to do so, or offering a leless zombie version of May’s Withdrawal Agreement and its equally abhorrent Political Declaration, must see his bounce dissipate to the point of being an aberration. At that point a general election may well be inescapable and the advantage will be with the Brexit Party.• Brian Monteith MEP is chief whip of the Brexit Party©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli worst moment for the scottish independence stars to align","story":"At a crossroads for Scottish nationalism Boris Johnson#s bombastic Tories aren#t the only ones making a spectacle of themselves, writes Dani GaravelliIf there was one bit of solace to be taken from last week’s ideological coup it was its potential to boost the campaign for Scottish independence. How could anyone watch Boris Johnson – a liar and a cad, with all the poise of a rutting walrus – talk up a No Deal and pledge to bring in an Australian-style immigration system without concluding: “Enough is enough” Each fresh cabinet appointment was a bell chiming the need for urgent action: Priti Patel, advocate of capital punishment, as Home Secretary Dominic Raab, supporter of proroguing parliament, as Foreign Secretary Michael Gove, butcher of the English education system, as head of the Cabinet Office. If those names weren’t enough to convince you to put your X beside the Yes box on a putative independence ballot paper, then what would it take  Katie Hopkins as Propaganda Secretary  The Big Bad Wolf as Minister for Housing In the three years since Leave’s victory, the two countries have drted further and further apart. And Johnson is the best recruiting sergeant the SNP could have asked for, which is why Nicola Sturgeon was quick to say she would consider accelerating plans for the second independence referendum she has already pledged to hold before .There are huge logistical obstacles to overcome we know the new Prime Minister is even less likely than Theresa May to grant a Section  order for a legally binding plebiscite. But with a UK government now aping Trumpian politics and refusing even to feign interest in its northern neighbour, there could be no better opportunity to win over No voters.Unfortunately, this opportunity has presented itself at the worst possible time for both the SNP and the wider Yes movement, which are in the process of tearing themselves asunder. Divisions between the left and right wings, the gradualists and the revolutionaries, the newbies and the old-timers, which were kept in check by the party machine and the need to unite behind their common cause in , have exploded into the open. The internal feuding is now so visible, and the atmosphere so poisonous, the campaign is faltering, just as it ought be gaining momentum. One of the most volatilefaultlines has been the reform of the Gender Recognition Actwhich –passed – would allow trans people to self-identy and remove the requirement for medical evidence. Less than a year ago, this was regarded as an easy win – a human rights issue that would consolidate the party’s reputation as a progressive force. But this gambit backfired. Every day now, political Twitter resounds to the angry exchanges between party members who have positioned themselves on either side of this fractious debate. Disagreements over policy are not unusual what sets this apart is the rancour of the rhetoric, and the bad faith, with some members of both camps resorting to abuse and others regarding it as a make-or-break issue for their continued membership of the party. So problematic has it proved that the reforms have been put on hold. However, instead of providing a cooling-off period, the delay appears to have created space for acrimony to fester and grow.Further isions are being caused by a perceived inertia at the top of the party. Johnson’s election has increased the pressure for action. With no obvious mechanism to achieve a second referendum, some on the fringes are demanding a Unilateral Declaration of Independence .Given there is no evidence of a majority in favour of separation, this would be reckless in the extreme. It would leave us isolated and raise the spectre of civil disorder. And yet those who resist the idea – many of whom were campaigning for independence before their critics were born – are having their commitment questioned.Throw into this melee, the implosion of All Under One Banner– the flag-fixated organisation beloved of the Trumpian tendency, but scorned by much of the mainstream, and you have a highly combustible set of circumstances. That AOUB would self-destruct – the director of operations Manny Singh was sacked earlier this month after being reported to the procurator fiscal in connection with breaching the Civic GovernmentAct – was entirely predictable, but cries of “I told you so” are hardly likely to placate those who may now be deprived of an outlet for their frustrations.Some of the party’s current problems are of its own making. It failed to recognise that the reform of the GRA, which could be seen as pitting the rights of two oppressed groups against each other, would be trickier to steer through Holyrood than the Marriage and Civil Partnership Act. It also ignored warnings about the need for senior party figures to clamp down on the extremists who frequently threaten its credibility. It is too late now to tame those wilder elements who shout about UDI.Though, for some, the isions are the product of sincerely held beliefs, for others they are proxies for a power struggle between those who continue to support Sturgeon and those who support Alex Salmond. Ever since a series of sex allegations were made against the former First Minister, and particularly since he was charged, the party appears to have been in the grip of a major power struggle between the two camps.Whatever the outcome, and however unfair this seems, the court case has the potential to bring down the First Minister and it has been clear for some time that Joanna Cherry fancies herself as the successor.Meanwhile, the UK political chat is of a possible general election in the autumn. With no likelihood of Johnson experiencing a change of heart on Scotland’s right to self-determination, this could provide the best route to the SNP securing a Section  order. A large rise in support for the SNP would be interpreted as a mandate for a second referendum and might allow the party to hold a position of power in a Labour minority government just as the DUP has done in the minority Tory government since June .In order to capitalise on this opportunity, however, the SNP would have to mobilise speedily and effectively. It would need to remember that only by parking its dferences and uniting behind a common goal did the movement drive the Yes vote up from  to  per cent in the last campaign.This time round, the dferences are more entrenched. The efforts to undermine Sturgeon have been concerted. With the court case pending, there is little she can do but hold her nerve against the plotters and conspiracy theorists to refuse to pander to those who fail to understand that independence – to be legitimate – must be the settled will of the Scottish people.If the party cannot see past its internal struggles and marshal itself into some sort of fighting force, it will squander the chance to rescue Scotland from the grips of the Tory cabal and the potential catastrophe of a No Deal Brexit. That battle can only be won by convincing the majority of Scots that independence will produce a better, more consensual kind of politics not merely a tartan version of the back-stabbing, ego-driven lust for power which has inflicted so much damage on the UK over the last five years.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish couple like monkeys in a theme park thanks to camera toting tourists","story":"With its grand Victorian houses and cobbled streets, it#s easy to see why the West End is such a hit with tourists.The picturesque residential area has become Insta-famous, with thousands of snaps posted to Instagram and other social media. But the popularity of this tourist hotspot is making it hell for residents, who are sick of large groups of visitors stopping outside their front doors and even peering in through their windows. Some locals have complained their homes now feel like a “theme park”.: Scottish couple cycle around the world after agreeing to the adventure in first Tinder message“We have large groups of tourists stopping outside our windows, standing on the railings to look into our homes and take photos,” said Michael Munro-Dunn of Drumsheugh Gardens.

On some occasions groups of up to  people are delivered by tour buses, and jostle for position to take the best photos of houses along the street.The couple say the problem is more severe than last year, and that it gets worse “week to week”. Both are worried about the impact of the festivals in August.They are so fed-up with nosy tourists they have considered moving to Dumfries.But as they are both disabled retirees this isn’t possible, as they rely on local medical services including Western General and the West End Medical Centre.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re.

Once the planning decision has been made it means we won’t be sitting further more years waiting on the business case being drawn up,” he said. Mr Maskey said he would be “very disappointed”the planning decision was not made within the next five months. “In all likelihood, in the absence of a minister, it will be DfI’s Permanent Secretary Katrina Godfrey making the decision.”When asked what would he say to those in the community who think Casement will never be built Mr Maskey said: “We are pushing for Casement to get built – I can understand that people say this will never be done because its been frustrating for so long, it has taken all these years to get the project to this stage. “I think the negavity around the project has reduced over the years. The new design has come in, there has been a lot of hard work done behind the scenes to try and get this major investment for West Belfast through. “The GAA have assured us that all the information needed is all in, that there are no outstanding issues at this stage. “There should be nothing that stalls this project back any further.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories. Incidentally, Stephen is playing in the Black Box in Belfast on October . Make sure you go along. I’ll be back.Following Stephen we were treated to the haunting Gaelic sounds of Diane Cannon and Manus Lunny, followed by Clann Mhic Ruairi. Another rousing ending to another Arranmore evening was brought courtesy of the impressive Honeyfeet.You can check out the final weekend of entertainment at the Earagail Arts Festival at eaf.ieWe stayed on Arranmore island at Early’s Bed # Breakfast where you will get a great welcome from Jerry and his we Pat.We travelled to Arranmore Island on the Blue Ferry – https:arranmorefastferry tickets "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailin away on the crest of a wave","story":"TO understand today’s music scene in West Belfast you have to go way back to brass, reed and silver bands. There were  children in our house, a sure sign you were from the Falls during the s, and St Peter’s Brass and Reed Band and St Paul’s Silver Band featured prominently in our lives.Members of St Peter’s Brass and Reed were affiliated with the Irish Free State Army where they were assigned to the Infantry so they could play in the Army Band. With names like Johnny McCorry, Pat Campbell, Fr Montague et al teaching them the ropes,it was no wonder that most of the Morgan brothers like Pat, Tony and Tom went on to make music a big part of their lives. Tony was a member of ious swing and brass bands while Tom, Pat and his we Ann started The Ballymurphy Martyrs Flute Band which then split to form Éire Nua. Another band on that scene were the Tom Williams Pipers, I’m sure our readers know more.Trombones and French horns, tubas and clarinets were all over our Beechmount house, with band unorms hanging over doors and music stands taking up precious space. We were all encouraged to learn an instrument as our clarinet-playing father Paddy Morgan thoughtwe were ever out of work, especially being Catholic, we could always busk and have our music to fall back on.During the late s through to  our Tom was in a band called ‘The Livin’ Thing’ named after Seamy and Roy Cassidy’s love of ELO. Also in the band with Tom, Seamy and Roy were Angela Hayes, John McKavanagh, Jim Hughes, Willie McAllister and Conor McHugh who has played for Katmandu, The Adventures and many other bands looking a genius keyboard player.Other bands doing the West Belfast circuit during those times were Brendan Hayes’ band The Dodgers, The MSJ Band, Sunshine, The Starjets, Katmandu, the mighty Avalon, Paris, Luv Bug, Kozee, The New Dimension, Glenties Folk Group, Alec Matthews Quartet, Blackwater Boys, Freemen, Baraka and the Rollie Stewart All Stars – and they all played anywhere they could get a booking. Places like The Green Briar, Terry McDermotts, The Sloan’s Club, Market Social, St Matthew’s, Donegal Celtic, The Old Burnt Cabin , Pound Loney Social Club, Andersonstown Social Club, Arlington House , The Inn Place , The Clubhouse , Beacon’s , Pass ‘n’ Grove, The Trocadero, Rossa, Chluain Árd and the infamous Lake Glen Hotel. These nights were usually followed by a fish supper from Aldo’s.During the dark days these groups gave people something to look forward to at weekends, sometimes taking big risks in travelling to ious places usually in clapped out cars, nearly always getting stopped and sometimes getting caught up in tragedies happening on the road. In  Tom was in a car accident near Dundalk. He was transferred to Jervis Street Hospital in Dublin where he died aged just . I know Tom’s family will feel proud when we hear about the talent that stemmed from West Belfast on st August as part of the Andersonstown News’ Greatest Hits Night when we’ll be celebrating the music of those days and remember Tom and all the people who kept the music going during our darkest times – we might even get a fish supper in Aldo’s afterwards!• Jog any memories  Let us know anybody or any place you remember through Text  or email Cathy at c.dobbin@belfastmediagroup"},{"url":null,"title":"aer lingus sorry for belfast flight diversion","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face.

The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals. Even burning his hand while working on his car failed to dampen Tonerrsquos day.Camillus Bradley and Crawford Henderson claimed second in the category after early second-placed holder Wesley Patterson went out with a broken crown wheel and pinion.Round five of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Rally Championship will see a switch from tarmac to gravel as crews head to Co Fermanagh in September for the Lakeland Stages Rally.The series is beginning to heat up and a three-way fight for the crown is developing between Derek McGeehan, Derek McGarrity and Stephen Wright.

A minute later, Stuart Martin, who had been heavily watched all afternoon, flashed over a super score and followed it up with another.Not to be outdone Derry star Mullan found the space to register his fourth point of the evening.The introduction of Ciaran Watson, Michael McKey and Padraig Doran saw a fresh approach as the visitors started to claw their way back into this thrilling encounter.In the th minute Conor McCrickard plundered a second goal for his side and when Stuart Martin pointed two minutes later, Down were just a score away from levelling the contest.Richie Mullan gave the home side a four-point advantage with a brilliantly angled free out near the sideline.The outcome of the game turned when McAlornan blocked Mullan shot for goal.Derry only managed to score two more points in the remaining five minutes as an inspired Down side levelled the contest for the first time with a m Costello point.With referee Aidan Ferguson indicating there was to be four minutes of extra time, it was game on. Eoghan Cassidy edged the home side in front with a super effort from out on the left wing, only to see McCrickard level once more from a similar type angled dead ball score.Derry had spurned an opportunity of snatching the game when the Down rearguard pressurised Seaacuten Kelly into shooting wide.Fom the resulting puck-out a tussle for possession saw Niall Fitzsimmons flash the sliotar over the Derry crossbar.When the whistle finally blew five minutes over the , it was Down who had progressed to Semple Stadium.Down: C McAlornan, E Kelly, T Murray, A Dorrian, C Smith, R McCrickard, N McFarlane , N Fitzsimmons , P Savage, J Hanrahan, R Blair , T Prenter , R Costello , C McCrickard , S Martin .

And Irsquove also been talking about sport ndash this time football and ensuring young people can get involved in teams, but also have opportunities to progress within their chosen sport as well.In Westminster Irsquove been talking about serious violence and ensuring we get police on our streets to deal with kne crime and other violence, which sadly wersquove seen on the rise in some parts of the UK.Irsquove also been talking about the steel industry. Steel is a crucial backbone here in Wales, but there is worrying news from some parts of the industry across the UK. Irsquom glad to say that we have a thriving steel plant here in the constituency, employing a lot of people who produce steel for our construction industry and many other infrastructure projects ndash but itrsquos crucial that those projects are open to Welsh steel, in order to drive jobs and business here in our local community.In the Commons I challenged the Conservative Welsh Secretary over what I believe is his failure to stand up for our steel industry.I asked him: ldquoSteel is of course the foundation of any successful industrial strategy.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was clear there was potential to design a scheme that would honour the buildingrsquos character and heritage, while creating something new and contemporary for future generations to enjoy.Features include double height windows in the duplex and both private and communal outside spaces. A full floor penthouse has a roof terrace to the front and back with panoramic views.Dorothy Foulkes, daughter of Stanley Sadler, who designed and built the distinctive building and ran his business from there for many years, still lives in Penarth and recently visited the site of the development.She said: ldquoI have many memories of the garage over the years. Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

The pension applies to both Vale and Cardf council workers.Friends of the Earth Cymru congratulated the council.Spokeswoman Bleddyn Lake said: ldquoAfter years of lobbying by Friends of the Earth, itrsquos fantastic to see Cardf councillors taking the historic decision to stop supporting the fossil fuel companies that are fuelling the climate crisis.ldquoNow itrsquos time for all the local authority pension funds in Wales to follow Cardfrsquos lead.ldquoToo many have been hiding away from taking meaningful action, but a climate emergency means we cannot afford to be investing money in the very companies driving climate change.ldquoResearch has shown esting from fossil fuel companies is better financially and will minimise future financial risks for those with pensions in these funds.ldquoClimate change is the challenge of our age. We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/NI-Chamber-President.jpg","title":"ni politicians must not waste time amid restoration talks","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s politicians “must not waste time” amid ongoing talks at restoring an Executive while business here should employ the “collaborative vision” that saw industries grow following the Good Friday Agreement.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%.
