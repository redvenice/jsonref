Originally \u0027affodil\u0027, a word for the plant we now call asphodel. Colloquially known as jonquils — from the French \u0027jonquille\u0027, the colour yellow. William Wordsworth (of \u0027a host, of golden daffodils\u0027 fame) pronounced it \u0027junkwill\u0027. In folklore, if you deliberately avoid stepping on them, fortune will favour you. If you give someone a gift of daffodils, they, too, will have good luck — but a single flower means penury and ill-fortune.ERICA — From Latin and Greek meaning \u0027heath\u0027 — where these spring-flowering heathers grow. Summer-flowering heather that covers moors is Calluna (from the Greek meaning \u0027to beautify, sweep clean\u0027) or ling (from the old Norse word \u0027lyng\u0027). According to Richard Mabey\u0027s Flora Britannica, heather ale was once a staple in the Scottish Highlands and drunk from cattle horns.FOXGLOVE — The scientific name is Digitalis — because the flowers (right) can be put on a finger (digitus is Latin for \u0027finger\u0027) like a thimble. The puzzling part is \u0027fox\u0027 — unless it\u0027s because they grow in woods where foxes live.         A rose gets its name from the Greek \u0027kunorodon\u0027 and Latin Rosa canina, \u0027dog rose\u0027. The prickly species deter thieves, and have been given the mock Latin name burglaris disembowelisOr perhaps it\u0027s derived from \u0027folks\u0027 gloves\u0027. In parts of Scotland, it\u0027s \u0027tod-tail\u0027 (as \u0027tod\u0027 is a Scots word for fox). Other names: ladies\u0027 fingers, floppy dock, dead-men\u0027s bells and fairy gloves.Once widely used in folk medicine as, though highly poisonous, it can be turned into a drug that slows and strengthens the heart.GOOSEGRASS — Covered with tiny hooks that cling onto almost everything. Also known as Stickywilly, Velcro Plant and Cleavers. Botanically, Galium aparine means \u0027milk seizer\u0027 — from the Greek word meaning milk. Juice from a related plant was once used to curdle milk in cheese-making.Called Goosegrass because it\u0027s loved by geese — or Hedgeheriff, Grip Grass, Scratweed, Mutton Chops, Claggy Meggies, Robin-run-in-the-Grass, Loveman, Tongue Bleed and Everlasting Friendship.         The scientific name is Digitalis — because the flowers (right) can be put on a finger (digitus is Latin for \u0027finger\u0027) like a thimbleHYACINTHOIDES — Literally \u0027hyacinth-like\u0027 — and the proper name for bluebells. Britain is home to half the world\u0027s population. But under threat from garden-escaped, paler, Spanish bluebell (Hyacinthoides hiica) with big concerns that hybridisation will dilute the gene pool of our pure, native bluebell and it could be lost for ever. Hyacinth is from the Greek youth Hyacinthus, killed accidentally by Apollo while being taught to throw the discus. Out of his blood grew the flower.IMPATIENS — Known as Busy Lizzies in gardens but as balsams in the wild. The word derives from the Latin \u0027impatiens\u0027 (impatient) after the tendency of the ripe seed-pods of some species to burst violently when touched. Seeds of the Himalayan balsam (whose leaves smell like Jeyes Fluid) can catapult 40ft away.JASMINE — From the Persian \u0027yasameen\u0027 (gift from God). Winter jasmine, which is flowering now, is Jasminum nudiflorum (which translates as \u0027naked flower\u0027)KNIPHOFIA — Commonly known as red-hot pokers but these African-originated plants were named after 18th-century German professor Johann Hieronymus Kniphof, who had a large botanical collection.         Commonly known as red-hot pokers but these African-originated plants were named after 18th-century German professor Johann Hieronymus Kniphof, who had a large botanical collectionLILY-OF-THE-VALLEY — Legend suggests it sprang from Eve\u0027s tears when she was exiled from the Garden of Eden. Its scientific name \u0027majalis\u0027 means \u0027of or belonging to May.\u0027 Also called May bells, Our Lady\u0027s tears and Mary\u0027s tears.MAGNOLIA — Named in honour of 17th-century French botanist Pierre Magnol. The tree was introduced to Europe from Japan in about 1709, while Magnol was alive, but the tree was not named until after his death.NARCISSUS — Daffodils and their relatives. Said to be linked to the Greek of the same name who starved to death because of his fixation with his own looks. The gods transformed him into a flower so he could remain for ever at the side of the stream where he admired his reflection. But this is not true. In Greek, \u0027narcissus\u0027 means \u0027numbness\u0027, so it\u0027s just a reference to the plant\u0027s narcotic nature.ORCHID — Name from the old Greek word for \u0027testicle\u0027 — because of the shape of many orchid roots. In Shetland, some call them Curly Doddies or Dog\u0027s Dubbles.POPPY — From the botanical name Papaver Rhoeas — \u0027papa\u0027 meaning \u0027thick milk\u0027 and a reference to its white sap Rhoeas is bastardised Greek for \u0027red\u0027, referring to the colour. Also, bledewort, redweed and thunder flower. When in good soil, one corn poppy can produce 800,000 tiny seeds.         Name from the old Greek word for \u0027testicle\u0027 — because of the shape of many orchid roots. In Shetland, some call them Curly Doddies or Dog\u0027s DubblesQUERCUS — The botanical word for the tree sacred to many gods. These include Zeus and Jupiter who both ruled over thunder and lightning — with oak trees prone to lightning strikes as they\u0027re often so tall. Quercin is a bitter alcohol obtained from the bark and acorns of oak.ROSE — Known to Shakespeare as sweet briar and eglantine. Mentioned by Oberon in A Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream: \u0027I know a bank . . . Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine. There sleeps Titania sometime of the night.\u0027 The name is from the Greek \u0027kunorodon\u0027 and Latin Rosa canina, \u0027dog rose\u0027. The prickly species deter thieves, and have been given the mock Latin name burglaris disembowelis.SALIX — The old Latin name for the willow from it comes salicylic acid, responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of aspirin. The name of the trees\u0027 catkins comes from Dutch \u0027katteken\u0027 (kitten). Willows are noted for their flexibility and graceful appearance, hence the adjective willowy.TULIP — From the Turkish pronunciation of the Persian word \u0027dulband\u0027 or turban, which the flowers resemble.         From the Latin \u0027anemone\u0027 and the Greek \u0027anemos\u0027 (wind or daughter of the wind). Alternatively the windflower, because the petals flutter in the breeze and open only when the wind blowsURTICA — The common name, Nettle, might have an ancient meaning \u0027to bind together\u0027 as nettle fibre was used for weaving. From the Latin for \u0027to burn\u0027, so linked with the stinging hairs. The word \u0027urticating\u0027 means \u0027stinging\u0027.VERONICA — Genus of plant that includes speedwells. Our name means just what it says — a fast-growing plant. Also because they are found beside roads and speed your journey. Named for St Veronica, who offered her cloth to Jesus. Other names: Eye Of The Child Jesus, Farewell, Goodbye and Cat\u0027s Eye (the pattern on the flower face).WALLFLOWER — An obvious name for Cheiranthus, plants that grow on walls also Gillyflowers and Milkmaids.XEROPHTE — A name for plants that grow in dry places, from the Greek for \u0027dry\u0027 — such as stonecrop and other Sedums.YARROW — Daisy-like, white or pale pink, with its name from Latin Achillea millefolium (\u0027thousand leaves\u0027). Greek hero Achilles\u0027 mother was said to have dipped his body in a tincture of the plant — except, fatally, his heel — in an attempt to make him invulnerable. Also Staunchweed as it\u0027s said to help stop nosebleeds.ZINNIA — Not spring flowers, but if you want this plant of the daisy family — named for botanist Johann Gottfried Zinn — to brighten your garden in summer, sow its seeds indoors now!"},{"url":null,"title":"Home Office letter quotes bible verses prove Christianity NOT religion peace","story":"Share this article Mr Stevens added on Twitter that his client will be appealing the decision and he will be complaining to the Home Office.Social media users were so shocked by the content of the letter a number of them did not even believe it was real - with the decision being described as \u0027gobsmacking\u0027 and \u0027unreal.\u0027Legal expert Conor James McKinney, deputy editor of website Free Movement, told Mail Online: \u0027Immigration lawyers often speak of a \u0027culture of disbelief\u0027 among the officials that make these life-or-death asylum decisions.\u0027This case seems to be an extreme example of an inidual official manufacturing a reason to refuse an asylum claim, and the Home Office acknowledges that it was out of line, but those working with asylum seekers do report horror stories almost as bad on a regular basis.\u0027Stephen Evans, chief executive of the National Secular Society told the Independent it was \u0027wholly inappropriate\u0027 for the Home Office to use \u0027theological justifications for refusing asylum applications\u0027.He added: \u0027Decisions on the merits of an asylum appeal should be based on an assessment of the facts at hand – and not on the state\u0027s interpretation of any given religion.

Photograph: InstagramHPV vaccine campaigner Laura Brennan (26) has saved “thousands” of women from getting cervical cancer, fellow campaigner Vicky Phelan has said.Paying tribute to the Ennis native, who died on Wednesday, Ms Phelan said: “Laura’s legacy is that she will have saved thousands of lives with her campaigning.”The two women met a number of times and regularly communicated by telephone and social media. “I was struck by her positivity. I couldn’t get over how positive she was,” Ms Phelan said.“I don’t think she realised the effect she had.”Ms Brennan first contacted the HSE in September 2017 saying she wanted to advocate publicly for the HPV vaccine after receiving a diagnosis of terminal cervical cancer.At the time the uptake of the vaccine was falling due to a campaign of opposition by some parents who alleged, without scientific evidence, their daughters were suffering chronic health conditions since receiving it. Uptake has since recovered from a low of 52 per cent at the time to 70 per cent now.Ms Brennan said she was determined every parent in Ireland who was about to make the decision whether their daughter was to be vaccinated against HPV, would hear her story first.“This illness is devastating and it’s going to take my life but the good news is there’s a vaccine that you can get that prevents it. HPV caused my cancer. I just wanted parents to know there is an alternative.” she said at the time.Broadcaster Ryan Tubridy paid an emotional tribute to Ms Brennan (26) on his RTÉ radio show this morning. “There’s something about Laura Brennan, there’s something about that positivity that will linger a long time in the minds of many of us. People are saying that they got their son or daughter vaccinated because of Laura, that’s a win for Laura, that’s a win for her family, for her legacy...“The point I want to make is a positive point and that is to say that her short life was one that had a big impact. She came to our attention, to my attention when she was a guest on the Late Late Show last April, she was just quite simply one of those extraordinary people that stand out. “You meet people day in, day out, I meet people in the shops, I meet people on the street and I meet people in work, I interview people on this programme and meet people on the television show, they all bring something different to the table, but what she brought was almost a souped up version of ordinary people which makes her extraordinary and made her extraordinary as she campaigned encouraging people to get the HPV vaccine.‘Relentlessly optimistic’“The words I would use to describe meeting her, because she was so striking, was kindness, and positive and empathetic and warm and relentlessly optimistic despite what she had to face. That’s what made her different, that’s why I remember as we stood together posing for pictures in the Green Room after the Late Late Show, I thought I was in the presence of something pretty special and I was.“The reaction to that interview from people around the country was phenomenal and the reaction was to her clearly, to Laura and what she had to say and how she said it because when you’re down and the chips are down and when you’re struggling you can really go down one of two roads, you can either go ‘the world is conspiring against me, why me, I don’t want this to happen to me’ or you can go down the other road which says ‘this is my lot, and I’m going to do something with it.’“Her great ambition in life was to work at a make up counter, she got it, she was obsessed, and I mean that in the right way with The Greatest Showman, she loved it, when she came on the show she walked on to the song This Is Me, one of her favourite songs. The other thing she wanted to do in life was to go to Copper Face Jacks and she did, she got to go, she got the gold card. “I don’t how she did it, but she managed to get on the Toy Show and it was The Greatest Showman, and rightly so because she had a limited time on this earth. She knew she had between two and three, maybe four years, to love, but it was much shorter than that as it turns out, there were times when she came close to leaving this world and she fought back.”Mr Tubridy urged that people not lose sight of the message about the importance of vaccination, “this was the message that Laura wanted to bring to the world, and she did.”Laura’s legacySpeaking later on RTÉ radio’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show, Ms Phelan said that the increase in uptake of the HPV vaccine from 50 per cent to 70 per cent was “all down to Laura”.Ms Phelan said: “I would love to have exact figures for her family. There is no doubt that she will have saved thousands of women from her fate. She didn’t want others to face what she had to.”The CEO of the Irish Cancer Society, Averil Power said Ms Brennan had used her time to help so many people. “It took a huge amount of courage for her to contact the HSE (to offer to front an HPV vaccine campaign).“She was determined that no other woman would have to go through what happened to her. She wanted to use her voice to help other women. Her voice will have saved thousands.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3833868.1553181910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit summit happening the key things to watch out for today","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            A man with painted EU and British flags on his face is seen ahead of a EU Summit in Brussels.

Photograph: Julien WarnandEPAWhere are we now?On Wednesday, British prime minister Theresa May signalled formally to the EU that she wished to extend the Article 50 process , delaying the date on which the UK would leave the EU from March 29th to June 30th. This request will be considered by the leaders of the other 27 EU countries during their meeting in Brussels starting on Thursday afternoon. They must approve an extension unanimously.In a televised address from Number 10 Downing Street on Wednesday night, Mrs May sought to put the blame on MPs for the proposed delay, with an extraordinary attack on parliament in which she urged them to say what Brexit, if any, they want.The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk – who as chair of the council of leaders runs the summits -– indicated the British must pass the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons next week before an extension is granted. What will Mrs May say to EU leaders today?You often hear the complaint from Brussels - with some justification - that nobody knows what the British want. But now Mrs May has said clearly what she wants – ratification by EU leaders of an agreement at Strasbourg last week which includes the concessions and clarifications on accelerated talks on the future relationship and the temporary nature of the backstop, and an extension of the Brexit date from tomorrow week until June 30th.The first won’t be a problem. But the second causes legal difficulties for the EU which favours a shorter extension, expiring before the European parliament elections at the end of May. So that is one issue for the leaders to discuss.Tusk’s statement – backed up by German chancellor Angela Merkel – that the UK must pass the withdrawal agreement if the short extension is to be signed off, raises one obvious question. What happens if Mrs May - again - fails to get her deal through the Commons, assuming she can actually manage to hold one?That is one key issue which EU leaders will be discussing. And French president Emmanuel Macron laid down a clear marker on his way into today’s meeting, saying his view was that if the withdrawal agreement was not passed, then “we will be going to a no-deal.”What then happens if the House of Commons approves the withdrawal agreement?If the withdrawal agreement is passed next week, then the extension is granted and the UK will use the extra time given under an extension to pass the necessary legislation to allow it to exit at the end of May, or end of June. The EU would want to be content that there is a clear passage for this legislation, too. Then the UK would exit the EU and enter what is called the transition period, a kind of standstill in which pretty much everything will remain the same until at least the end of 2020 – except for the fact that the UK will have left. During this period the two sides will try to agree trading arrangements for the long-term.However, there is still an open question about how the deal may be put to MPs again after a ruling by the Speaker of the House of Commons that the same deal couldn’t be put to them again without significant changes. What will Mrs May do if she fails again? That is what EU leaders will want to know. But Mrs May will also want to know what EU leaders will do if the vote goes down again. It has seemed inconceivable that the EU would refuse an extension and allow the UK to crash out next week. But there is sufficient alarm in Dublin about this happening by accident that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar yesterday urged everyone to “cut the British some slack”. And President Macron’s intervention today will have set nerves further on edge.Tusk had suggested that he could hold an emergency summit of EU leaders next week, if needed. There has been speculation that the EU might be willing to offer the UK a longer extension, subject to strict conditions, including the necessity that it elect MEPs. But this cannot now be taken for granted. And it is also not clear whether the UK government would sign up for whatever conditions were set down, if the EU did decide to give it more time. UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said earlier today that if the agreement is voted down three scenarios were then possible. One would be a long extension with “ onerous conditions.” The second would be a “no-deal” exit at the end of next week. The third would be a decision to revoke Article 50, which the UK could do unilaterally but would appear contrary to everything the UK government has said. Macron has raised doubt about whether the option of a longer extension would be offered, though we will have to wait and see what is said after the summit meeting.Part of the problem, if the House of Commons does vote down the deal, is that time will then be very short to work out what happens next, before the due date of departure – 11pm on March 29th – arrives. How will today end up ?As is normal, there are draft conclusions, agreed in advance by diplomats and government officials, circulating on the other aspects of the summit today. But there are no draft conclusions on Brexit. That’s because nobody knows what the leaders will decide. The assumption that they will signal an openness to a short Article 50 extension, but will postpone a decision until after an expected vote in the House of Commons.Irish sources say two things: they haven’t seen this level of uncertainty about a summit since the Greek crisis, and we may all be back here next week.This process has long been described by various sides as a game of chicken. If that is so, it only gets interesting at the end. And we are in the end phase now.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Julien WarnandEPAThere is an “openness” to an extension of article 50 to allow the UK to postpone next week’s Brexit date, but EU leaders will have to hear from the British prime minister Theresa May before deciding on terms of the extension, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said in Brussels.Although some EU leaders have struck a harder note, Mr Varadkar repeated his line about “cutting the British some slack” that he used earlier when speaking to journalists. However, he stressed that if there is a crash-out Brexit next week, that would be the UK’s choice.“I think there is an openness to an extension across the board. Everyone wants to avoid no deal. But we can’t have a situation where we have a rolling cliff edge, where we just put off decisions and deadlines every couple of months,” he said.“I think we all appreciate that the situation in London is somewhat chaotic at the moment, and for that reason I think we need to cut the entire British establishment a little bit of slack on this,” he said.“No deal can only ever be a British choice. Let’s not forget that the March 29 deadline was set by the United Kingdom in the first place, and it’s always up to them even at the last moment to revoke article 50 – they do not need permission to do that,” he said.“So no deal, if it happens, will be a British choice and a British decision,” he added.Asked what would happen if a third vote on the withdrawal agreement was defeated in the House of Commons next week, Mr Varadkar said: “I think we’ll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it . . . if the agreement doesn’t pass then we’ll have to hear from the British government and the British parliament as to what their plans are because bear in mind they’ve also said and voted for the fact that they don’t want to end up in a no-deal scenario in a few days time either.”“We do need to see a resolution sooner rather than later,” the Taoiseach said.He said now was the time for the British government and parliament to make difficult decisions on Brexit.“Brexit was never going to be clean, and Brexit would always require some very hard choices for the UK to make – it was never going to be all good and no bad, and those decisions now need to be made,” he said. Meanwhile, the Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin, who is in Brussels for a pre-summit meeting of the leaders of the alliance of European liberal parties, said he expects there to be an extension to article 50 next week.However, Mr Martin warned of a growing crisis caused by the continuing chaos in the British political system.“To be honest the view of prime ministers today is that there is a real sense of crisis,” Mr Martin said. “There’s a real sense of an absence of a clear pathway to resolving that crisis right now. So I think they’re looking at a step by step approach, and that’s what you’re likely to see this evening and leading in to next week. And by the end of next week, if that vote doesn’t carry in the British Parliament, then I think you’re into a very serious situation.”Ireland, he said, must support an extension, warning that “a no deal Brexit is probably worse than has been anticipated to date.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Britons have the most to fear: an economic slump of €57 billion annually or €900 per head of population.\u0026nbspAfter Ireland (€720 per capita), the study says a hard Brexit would hit hardest, in order, France and Italy.“Brussels and London have to do everything to order a departure,” said Aart De Geus, chief executive of the Bertelsmann Foundation.Some 1,001 days after the Brexit vote, with just eight days until the scheduled Brexit departure date, Dr Merkel told the Bundestag on Thursday she agreed with European Council president Donald Tusk’s analysis. A short extension of the March 29th deadline until the end of June, as requested by British prime minister Theresa May, was possible in theory. But only, the chancellor said, if parliament backs the Brexit agreement agreed between London and Brussels.“We can meet this request . . . we need an orderly Brexit, this is also in the German interest,” said Dr Merkel ahead of a gathering of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday. “However much we are working towards an orderly solution, for weeks and months we have prepared for the fact that there could be a disorderly departure.”Mrs May’s request would also have to take into consideration any legal concerns regarding the European elections at the end of May, the German leader added.“But no doubt we can talk positively about a short extension,” she added.For Brexiteers expecting a last-minute extra wurst from Berlin, the German leader disappointed. The existing departure documents, in particular the more recent additions from Strasbourg, showed that “important and, in my view sufficient steps were taken”.Looking to the future, she said relations would not be as close with the UK as when it was an EU member state, but the chancellor insisted that “the door to a close co-operation, in friendship and in common interest, from our side, stands wide open”.Exhaustion and mockeryFor the order-loving Germans, their growing concern and alarm over the Brexit drama in London has collapsed decades of deep respect towards Britain. Now media coverage is characterised largely by exhaustion and mockery.The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine daily put a hamster on its front page, flagging a feature inside about stock-piling of medicines.In the picture’s caption, the FAZ joked that London’s “unparalleled spectacle . . . a drama shot through with curious and unworthy spices” has left everyone “unsure whether to laugh or cry”.Germany’s political class is similarly unsure how to respond to the Brexit drama. And not everyone in Dr Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is as equanimous as the chancellor. Norbert Röttgen, head of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee, said he favoured a long extension or none at all.“The EU cannot allow itself to become part of the political tactics of Theresa May,” he said on German radio. “Trump and Putin are laughing themselves silly at how Europe is carrying on.”As Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn followed Theresa May to Brussels, its sister party in Germany – the Social Democrats (SPD) – called for a cross-party solution to overcome Brexit uncertainties.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Everyone knows it.’ Photograph:  John ThysAFPGetty ImagesThe UK is headed towards a no-deal Brexit scenario if its parliament votes against prime minister Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement for a third time next week, French president Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday.Mr Macron said he was open to a short, technical extension and that European leaders could not let the turmoil surrounding Brexit drag on.“We must be clear, to ourselves, our British friends and our people. Firstly, we’ve been negotiating the withdrawal agreement for two years. It cannot be renegotiated. Secondly, in the event of another no vote in Britain, we will be heading towards a no deal. Everyone knows it,” Mr Macron said as he arrived at a summit of European leaders in Brussels.Mrs May arrived in Brussels on Thursday amid uncertainty and disarray over her country’s exit from the European Union.Speaking to reporters as she arrived Mrs May said she “sincerely hopes” Britain will be able to leave the EU with a deal with Brussels.Arriving in the Belgian capital for an EU summit, the British prime minister said: “What is important is that parliament delivers on the result of the referendum and that we deliver Brexit for the British people. I sincerely hope that we can do that with a deal.“I am still working on ensuring parliament can agree a deal so we can leave in an orderly way. What matters is that we deliver on the vote of the British people.”Mrs May is in Brussels to appeal to EU leaders to grant her a delay to Brexit, amid warnings of “extreme unpredictability” if the impasse is not resolved.The country’s foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said Britain would be faced with three options if Mrs May’s deal was defeated again next week: revoke article 50 leave without a deal or, he said, a longer extension could be granted at an emergency EU summit, but with “onerous conditions”.Mrs May’s Downing Street statement on Wednesday, in which she blamed MPs for failing to implement the result of the 2016 EU referendum and told frustrated voters “I am on your side”, was described as a “low blow” by one former Tory minister. But Jeremy Corbyn was also under fire after pulling out of a meeting between Mrs May and opposition party leaders because party defectors who are now members of the Independent Group turned up.The behaviour of the Labour leader, was described by one of their number – Chuka Umunna – as “juvenile” at a time of national crisis.Mr Corbyn on Thursday held what he described as “very constructive discussions” in Brussels with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and European Commission secretary general Martin Selmayr which he said had focused on the means to prevent a no-deal Brexit next Friday.The Labour leader twice declined to rule out the option of halting Brexit by revoking the article 50 letter informing Brussels of Britain’s intention to quit, although he strongly played down the prospect.Asked if he was willing to consider revocation if it was the only way to prevent a no-deal Brexit, Mr Corbyn said: “These are hypotheticals. So far as we’re concerned, we think there’s an urgency in constructing a majority for an agreeable solution and that’s what we’re concentrating on at the moment.”Ahead of the summit, European Council president Donald Tusk said a “short” delay should be possible – but only if MPs finally back Mrs May’s deal before the deadline day on March 29th.With fears in Brussels growing that the UK is heading for a no-deal break, he said he would not hesitate to call an emergency summit next week if that proved necessary.Mrs May formally made the request for an extension to the end of June in a letter to Mr Tusk on Wednesday.She had previously indicated she would seek a longer delay after her deal went down to a 149-vote defeat in last week’s second “meaningful vote”.However, she reportedly backed down after the threat of cabinet resignations by Brexiteer ministers, who feared it could spell the end of their hopes of leaving the EU.Mr Hunt warned Britain faced the choice of “resolving this issue or extreme unpredictability”. He sought to defend the prime minister’s statement, saying she was under “extraordinary pressure” and feels a “sense of frustration” – and said MPs have a “special responsibility” in a hung parliament.“She is absolutely determined to deliver what people voted for and I think... the Brexit process has sapped our national confidence and we need to remember now what we’re capable of as a country.”European reactionIn Brussels on Wednesday, Mr Tusk said the question of how long an extension the remaining EU 27 were prepared to grant “remains open”. All 27 need to agree before the extension is granted.But European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker warned Britain would have to leave by May 23rd if it did not want to hold elections to the European Parliament – which start on that date – something Mrs May said she is determined to avoid.German chancellor Angela Merkel said: “With regard to the date of June 30th, we have to take into consideration that we have European elections in May.“We can discuss this wish next week if we have a positive vote in the British parliament on the exit agreement.“The leaders of the EU 27 will intensively discuss this request. In principal, we can meet this request if we have a positive vote in the British parliament next week about the exit document.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The children, born last autumn, are thought to be the world\u0027s first gene-edited babies.The revelation took the world by surprise and was met with global condemnation. Medical ethics were breached because HIV can be treated without gene-editing and the risks that entails. Editing the genes of embryonic DNA may also have far reaching consequences as it alters the germline - meaning that the changes made are passed from one generation to another and cannot be undone.The panel, which included 18 researchers and bioethicists, said there is an “urgent need” to create a transparent global registry which lists all experiments related to human gene-editing, and asked the WHO to set up such a registry immediately. Dr Margaret Ann Hamburg, co-chair of the WHO panel, said the proposed registry - where scientific journals and funders would have to list anything they publish or finance - would “increase accountability of scientific researchers around the world.”The database should include studies that edit the DNA of eggs, sperm and early embryos, but should also include those that edit adult cells to curtail disease - which is far less controversial.The panel added that over the next two years it aims to produce “comprehensive governance framework” for work in the field, to help prevent maverick uses of the developing technology. But the panel stopped short of proposing a moratorium on germline gene-editing, which was called for by an international group of scientists in an article in Nature journal last week. I don\u0027t think a vague moratorium is the answer to what needs to be done, said Dr Hamburg. What we\u0027re trying to do is look at the broad picture.But Dr Hamburg also said: “The committee agrees that it is irresponsible at this time for anyone to proceed with clinical applications of human germline genome editing.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleLong-term ethical concern and debate around germline editing revolves around the creation of “designer babies” - embryos modified not just to protect against disease but to produce children with enhanced intelligence, athletic prowess or cosmetic traits. Stephen Hawking’s final prediction, in an essay published after his death, was that the wealthiest strata of society would soon begin editing their own and their children’s DNA to create a ‘superhuman’ race, with enhanced memory, disease resistance, intelligence and longevity.He argued this risked iding humanity into genetic ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’.But in an interview in last week\u0027s  George Church, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, said the controversy surrounding the editing of human embryos was overblown. He compared the debate to the short lived moral panic that proceeded the introduction of IVF treatment, predicting that germline editing would eventually be “adopted worldwide”. He did add, however, that there were legitimate concerns about the technology exacerbating inequalities.The WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , welcomed the panel’s proposals. “Gene editing holds incredible promise for health, but it also poses some risks, both ethically and medically,” he said.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security \u0026#39Silent assassin\u0026#39 about to strike: Why Michael Gove is tipped to replace Theresa MayBrexit latest news: Macron warns UK \u0026#39heading for no deal\u0026#39 if MPs reject third vote in CommonsComment: Voters are indeed angry with their MPs - but pointing it out won\u0026#39t help May pass her dealChildhood trauma scars the brain and boosts depression riskHow likely is a delay to Brexit?

The band\u0027s manager, and former wife of the bassist, took him to court in an attempt to have their final tie severed.Tricia Ronane, 54, married musician Paul Simonon in 1990 and for over 20 years she managed the band.They had two children, models Louis, 27, and Claude Simonon, 24, before splitting up in 2006 and orcing in 2008.She has now lost a £5m orce fight, asking to be free of her managerial duties, telling a judge that she is stuck chained to a man who won\u0027t even speak to her.Mr Simonon - famously pictured destroying his bass guitar on the cover of the band\u0027s London Calling album, agreed that Miss Ronane would have a split of the band\u0027s future income after they orced in 2008.Miss Ronane argued that she wants to sell her rights to a share of his Clash royalties to an investment fund for £5m - but after the musician objected, a judge has now blocked the sale.The Clash in 1977Her barrister, Jennifer Meech, told London\u0027s High Court that Miss Ronane is forever stuck with a man who refuses to communicate with her for any reason.Mr Simonon isn\u0027t speaking to her, isn\u0027t responding to her, she said, adding that dealing with Clash money was a constant battle for Miss Ronane.However, the 63-year-old\u0027s barrister argued that selling to a third party could create great difficulties for the 63-year-old in the future, as he would have a business partner forced upon him, his barrister James Mather said.That new partner might want to invest some of the Clash profits, rather than withdraw them, he said, preventing Mr Simonon getting at his money.He said the 50 per cent shareholdings in the company were not meant to be assets to be sold, but just a means to allow the former couple to split up Clash money as they had agreed.Under the terms of a 2010 financial settlement, they each kept one of their two London properties, while Miss Ronane, who was Kate Moss\u0027 maid of honour at her 2011 wedding to Jamie Hince, paid him a £400,000 lump sum.They also agreed that they would share the cost of their sons\u0027 private education and split any royalties they earned through The Clash between them.To that end, they remained directors and 50 per cent shareholders of a company, Cut-Throat Productions Ltd, into which all their Clash income was paid.Miss Ronane, who stopped working for the band in 2011, now says that being tied to her ex through the company has became unbearable, due to his attitude towards her.However, Mr Simonon\u0027s barrister told the judge that the former couple don\u0027t get along at the moment and the punk musician is very concerned about who she might sell her shares to.We are dealing with £5m worth of shares and a relationship of critical importance to Mr Simonon, he said. What is at issue is having this new business partner forced upon him.He said the meaning of the words in the orce settlement was clear: It is not open to each of the shareholders to sell their shares.But for Miss Ronane, Ms Meech argued that there was nothing in the orce settlement to ban a sale of shares.If she wants to sell her rights to income from The Clash, then she should be allowed to, said the lawyer.Otherwise, they would be forever stuck in this company, which at least on her evidence isn\u0027t functioning very well, she said.She had only decided to sell her shares after enduring years of Mr Simonon refusing to speak to or otherwise communicate with her either as his former wife, the mother of his children or as a director of Cut-Throat, she claimed.But while describing the case as an unfortunate dispute, Judge Cawson ruled that Miss Ronane cannot sell her share of income from The Clash.A transfer of shares by either of them would be inconsistent and incompatible with the terms of the orce settlement which they agreed in 2010.We are concerned with shares worth a considerable amount of money and an income stream no doubt of considerable value, he told the court.He ordered Miss Ronane to pay £30,000 towards Mr Simonon\u0027s lawyers\u0027 bills for the hearing, on top of her own, taking her bill to about £60,000.\u0026#39Silent assassin\u0026#39 about to strike: Why Michael Gove is tipped to replace Theresa MayBrexit latest news: Macron warns UK \u0026#39heading for no deal\u0026#39 if MPs reject third vote in CommonsComment: Voters are indeed angry with their MPs - but pointing it out won\u0026#39t help May pass her dealChildhood trauma scars the brain and boosts depression riskHow likely is a delay to Brexit?

Her agency accused Mariah Bell of intentionally injuring Ms Lim with the blade of her skate. In echoes of the infamous incident involving US skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan in January 1994, Ms Lee’s representatives have claimed there are sufficient grounds to believe Ms Bell’s act was premeditated. A representative of All That Sports told Yonhap News that during the official rehearsal period, “Lim was slowly skating on the edge of the rink after completing her turn. Mariah Bell, who was scheduled to rehearse after Lim, suddenly kicked and stabbed Lim’s calf with her skate blades.“Mariah Bell didn’t apologise to Lim Eun-soo after the incident and instead continued to rehearse for her routine”, the official added. “We believe this is not a minor situation that can happen in an official rehearsal.“We have asked the Korea Skating Union to file an official complaint against Mariah Bell for her intentional infliction of Lim Eun-soo’s injury”. The case has been compared to that of Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan in 1994 Ms Lim was treated for an injury and was later able to compete in the tournament with a sticking plaster covering her wound. The Korean skater finished the day in fifth position with a personal high score in her first senior world championships, ahead of 22-year-old Ms Bell in sixth position. Both skaters are under based in Los Angeles and are under the tutelage of Rafael Arutyunyan, with Ms Lim’s agency also accusing Ms Bell of “bullying” her for several months and for launching into a verbal attack against Ms Lim immediately before the competition in Japan.Neither of the skaters has commented on the incident.\u0026#39Silent assassin\u0026#39 about to strike: Why Michael Gove is tipped to replace Theresa MayBrexit latest news: Macron warns UK \u0026#39heading for no deal\u0026#39 if MPs reject third vote in CommonsComment: Voters are indeed angry with their MPs - but pointing it out won\u0026#39t help May pass her dealChildhood trauma scars the brain and boosts depression riskHow likely is a delay to Brexit?

There is no difference in the look or shape of the buds themselves and there is only one visible change to the case: a Wireless Charging Case is now available\u0026nbspfor an extra £40, allowing you to place the case on a compatible wireless charging pad instead of plugging it in with a Lightning cable.This means there’s a tiny LED on the outside of the case to show when it’s charging.\u0026nbspThe new\u0026nbspAirPods\u0026nbspare on sale online now and will be in Apple Stores next week.Created with Sketch.Apple unveils the iPhone X Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017So far, so good.“The bigger picture, though, is that AirPods simply deliver a magical wireless experience.”I’m not sure that I like using the word magical, but I see what he’s saying. Pairing AirPods with an iPhone is exceptionally simple. As Joswiak explains, “As soon as you’ve pulled the AirPods out of the box and flipped open the lid on the case, there’s a simple one-tap set-up, they’re automatically paired and connected. Once you’ve done that, they’re immediately set up to work with all your Apple devices, including an Apple Watch, iPad or Mac that uses the same Apple ID. Once you’ve used AirPods, you never go back. They’re the most popular wireless headphones in the world. They’ve become a cultural phenomenon. For us, they’re the key ingredient to the wireless future. We designed them to be effortless to use.”Open the case near an iPhone and a screen will pop up showing the exact battery life. And there are other cool features, like the way when you’re talking to someone, and you naturally take one of the AirPods out your ear to do so, the music pauses, resuming when you put the bud back into your ear.All these features remain the same in the new version. By the way, you can use AirPods with Android phones, for instance, but the pairing is not as seamless.Kate Bergeron explains the new headphones in more detail:\u0026nbsp“When we were thinking about generation two, we really wanted to focus on this new H1 chip that was designed specifically for headphones. We’re combining wireless technology which is a hallmark of Apple’s and very highly customised audio. Together, these things create an amazing audio experience. Because the H1 chip is more powerful, it delivers some profound efficiencies, which means you can have Siri available all the time.”Ah, yes, I forgot to say, another AirPods feature is the way you can tap on either of the buds while they are in your ear and then ask Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, to change the track, lift the volume or even give you spoken directions to wherever you’re going.AirPods 2 on Wednesday, 20 March (Apple)Now, with the new AirPods, you don’t need to tap. Just say, “Hey, Siri” and it will respond. This is made possible thanks to the H1 chip saving so much battery life that it can be listening for the magic wake words at all times.“So, we’re able to have \u0027Hey, Siri\u0027 listening enabled at all times and still keep the same battery life as before: five hours’ listening time is still achieved thanks to this new chip,” Bergeron says.“In addition, we’ve been able to deliver 50 per cent more talk time so when you’re on a call, you’ll have three hours of battery life, not two.”Leaving aside whether jabbering on for three hours is really desirable, this is quite a feat. So, how come more talk time but no extra battery life? That’s because when you’re talking, listening out for “Hey, Siri” is turned off.Switching between devices is up to twice as fast, now, too. “If you’re using your AirPods between your Mac, your iPhone and your iPad, switching is even more seamless and the connection to phone calls, when you’re pulling your AirPods out of your pocket to connect to a phone call, is up to 50 per cent faster than before,” Bergeron says. “In addition, for some casual gaming on your iPhone, for instance, we’re able to provide up to 30 per cent lower latency.”My experience of Apple’s stats in situations like this is that the figures don’t mean that much but the experience when you use them is noticeably different.Apple leak reveals bizarre new feature for 2019 iPhoneApple unveils brand new iPads in surprise announcementThe improved chip means improved audio in different ways, too. “The combination of the wireless changes we’ve made in the chip as well as the audio gives a more robust wireless connection, which turns into better audio quality in different conditions. When going outside, some people have found that in that environment there can be problems maintaining RF (radio frequency) links. Now, in all sorts of different conditions we find we’re able to have better audio quality all the time.”The LED on the new wireless charging case is the main visible difference compared to the previous case. “The cases are exactly the same size, there’s a slight increase in weight thanks to adding the wireless charging coil but it’s negligible.”Wireless charging is traditionally slower than through a Lightning cable. “It’s just over two hours to charge the case from zero to 100 per cent via Lightning,” Joswiak chips in, “and around three-and-a-half hours wirelessly. But realistically, customers rarely charge from zero, and the fast charge is the same as before – just put the AirPods themselves into the charging case for 15 minutes and you get three hours of listening time.”Apple is expected to release a new version of iOS, the operating software for iPhones and iPads, soon. I wonder if the new hands-free Siri feature will have to wait for that, but Joswiak’s reply is elegant rather than factually revealing: “We always recommend that for every new product that customers install the latest version of software that’s available at that time.”Reading the runes, I would imagine it means that by the time the new AirPods reach customers next week, that enhanced software will be available to make hands-free Siri work.The new AirPods are a big event because almost no product attracts the level of interest of these little in-ear wireless headphones.\u0026nbsp Next week, if they live up to Apple’s promises, they’ll be even more desirable.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1021 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2021 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky.

Fans believe that Endgame will see the surviving characters, including Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), attempt to reverse the cataclysmic events.Many theories have been doing the rounds, but one that has fans particularly excited centres around the character of Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), who is expect to play a huge role in the film.Avengers: Endgame will be released in cinemas on 26 April.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The index is a measure of inflation calculated by tracking the price of a selected basket of goods and services.Beer prices rose 0.6 per cent\u0026nbspbetween January and February compared with a decline of 1.1 per cent\u0026nbsplast year. Annually, food and alcohol inflation hit 1.1 per cent\u0026nbspand 5.1 per cent\u0026nbsprespectively.The price of food was up 0.4 per cent between January and February compared with 0.1 per cent last year. Alcohol and tobacco were up\u0026nbsp0.9 per cent increase on the month versus flat prices in February 2018.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said: “While February’s rise in inflation may be marginally disappointing for consumer purchasing power, it is still looking appreciably better than in mid-2018 – especially as earnings growth retained its firmer tone in January. Real earnings growth is currently 1.5 per cent, the best level since end-2016, although still appreciably below longterm norms.”Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersHe added that different Brexit outcomes were likely to affect CPI in the coming months.He said: “Our suspicion is that inflation will spike significantly higher if the UK leaves the EU without a deal,\u0026nbspprimarily due to a likely marked fall in sterling – even though the government has indicated that under a temporary scheme, 87 per cent\u0026nbspof imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access compared to 80 per cent\u0026nbspof imports currently being tariff-free.”Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “The rate of inflation is stable, with a modest rise in food as well as alcohol and tobacco offset by clothing and footwear prices rising by less than they did a year ago.”Upward pressure also came from recreation and culture, as prices rose between January and February 2019 compared with a smaller rise between the same two months last year. Computer games had the biggest effect.But clothing and footwear prices had a downward effect. Although pricetags were higher in February as usual, following the January sales, the increase was smaller than the same period last year.Annually, clothing and footwear prices dropped 2 per cent.At the pumps, motorists saw lower fuel costs last month, as petrol fell by 0.5p per litre on the month to 119.1p. Diesel also fell by 0.2p to 129.3p.The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was 2.4 per cent, down from 2.5 per cent\u0026nbspin January. It is the lowest since October 2016, when it was 2.2 per cent.It comes ahead of the Bank of England’s interest rate decision on Thursday, when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.KPMG UK’s chief economist Yael Selfin said the central bank may need to act more aggressively in future.She said: “Our expectations are for inflation to average around the Bank of England’s 2 per cent\u0026nbsptarget this year but to rise further in 2020, putting pressure on them to act more aggressively than markets currently anticipate.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

On 29\u0026nbspMarch, the UK will simply cease to be a member of the EU if a Withdrawal Agreement or an extension to Article 50 is not agreed.One of the main changes that would immediately result on this day is that the UK will need to apply its own tariff rates on its imports. It will not be bound by the EU\u0027s common external tariffs. It will also not be eligible for zero tariffs on exports to the EU. And, it will lose the benefits of almost all of the EU’s trade agreements, which cover 82 countries. To date, just seven of these trade agreements have been converted into continuity agreements, and none of these are with a major trade partner of the UK.\u0026nbspThe government has announced that, in the case of no deal, it will eliminate tariffs on 87 per cent of imports but introduce tariffs in key sectors including cars, ceramics and key meat products. The Cabinet has been ided over its tariff policy, with Michael Gove reportedly pursuing high tariffs, at least on agriculture, and Phillip Hammond preferring to opt for lower rates. Meanwhile, Liam Fox has floated the idea of unilaterally dropping all tariffs to zero.\u0026nbspFor many products, there is actually very little flexibility. Politics aside, the economic reality is that the maximum tariffs that can be set for any product will be determined by the “bound rates” that the UK already has in place under the WTO.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMembers of the WTO negotiate over the maximum tariffs that governments can apply and these rates must be the same for imports from all countries, with the exception of developing countries and certain trade partners with who there is a comprehensive trade agreement in place. Successive rounds of WTO negotiations have led to low maximum tariff rates on a lot of goods.The average tariff that the UK charges to WTO members is under 3 per cent. But the average rate masks a number of tariff peaks, notably for agricultural products, textiles and apparel, leather products and automobiles, where the government, if they so wish, has a lot more room to deviate from the current EU tariff policy. \u0026nbspThe government faces a trade-off when choosing tariffs: high tariffs will mean higher prices to consumers, no matter whether they buy from the EU or from the rest of the world, as the UK will have to charge the same tariffs to all WTO members under no deal.Low tariffs will expose UK producers to greater import competition and will result in reduced bargaining power in future trade negotiations. The example of food imports illustrates this trade-off. Tariffs\u0026nbspon meat can be as high as 84 per cent, dairy produce up to 74 per cent and grains 63 per cent.At the moment, 71 per cent of UK\u0027s agricultural imports come in duty free from the EU, while the rest face these high tariffs. Jacob Rees-Mogg sees Brexit as a chance to break away from the “protectionist racket” of the EU and extend zero tariffs to all imports so that British consumers can enjoy lots of juicy, perhaps hormone-fed, Australian beef. Michael Gove wants to keep beef tariffs high to protect UK farmers from import competition.\u0026nbspLive: Theresa May caves to Brexiteers with request for short delayThe government’s plan is to place food items that are not produced in the UK (like oranges and sugar) on the zero tariff list and food items, like beef and lamb, that are produced in the UK on the sensitive list with tariffs. This is a sensible approach to account for consumer and producer interests - get rid of unnecessary costs to consumers where possible and try to protect domestic producers from import competition where desirable.While this logic seems sensible for unilateral trade policy actions, it overlooks the fact that tariff peaks mostly remain in sectors where trade partners are reluctant to open up their economies to imports. Take cars for instance. Most developed countries protect their auto industry, arguably because of the value addition, research and development and the high quality of jobs that it provides.Under no deal, the UK will impose a 10 per cent tariff on cars – the same rate currently applied by the EU to external countries - to protect the domestic auto industry. But that\u0027s just not going to be significant enough to help the UK car industry during a time when its exports start to incur tariffs in their biggest export destination - the EU.In fact, the most comprehensive study on the projected impacts of no deal on the UK car industry suggests a 12 per cent reduction in UK car production, because the rise in domestic sales would hardly make up for the loss in sales from increased trade barriers in UK\u0027s export markets.\u0026nbspUnilateral trade policy actions are limited in terms of what they can achieve. That\u0027s the reason trade agreements exist – they enable countries to reduce trade barriers and encourage mutual economic activity by providing reciprocal market access to each other.Government plan to axe no deal tariffs savaged by all and no wonderBrexit plan to slash tariffs after no deal condemned as \u0027madness\u0027Tariffs to be scrapped on most imports after no-deal BrexitPlans to scrap import tariffs after no-deal Brexit to be kept secretThe EU-Canada trade deal does exactly that in the auto sector – both sides made concessions to each other by lowering tariffs and reducing costs arising from regulatory ergence between them.\u0026nbspGovernments rarely eliminate all tariffs unilaterally because tariffs are important bargaining chips in trade negotiations to get market access concessions from trade partners in the same or other areas.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspUltimately, while the government\u0027s proposed principle of managing consumer and producer interests appears sound, it begs the same question that many have been wondering since the run-up to the referendum. Is all this tinkering over little margins of adjustment on unilateral trade policy worth the loss of deep market access with the world\u0027s largest trading bloc and the clout that goes with it in third country trade negotiations?The actual performance of the economy since the Brexit referendum suggests \u0027no\u0027. The UK is now one of slowest growing OECD countries. Sterling has depreciated massively and remains low.\u0026nbsp This has already made imports more expensive, especially intermediate inputs, and there has been no export boom. New research shows workers have already borne the brunt of this.As the UK\u0027s place in global value chains has become more precarious, workers have seen slower wage growth and cutbacks in job-related education and training. This does not augur well for future productivity.\u0026nbspMuch time has been spent over tariffs and this has taken away from the bigger question of weak productivity and low real wage growth in the UK. Services, which have no tariffs, are key to this as they employ 80 per cent of the UK\u0027s workforce. The scale of the costs from no deal in services and related activities could be large.The EU is a crucial market for UK services and getting access to third markets in these sectors is even more fraught with concerns over sovereignty and quality standards. Except sectors like finance which have the clout to get special deals, much of the UK economy will have to pay a hefty cost under no deal, which could result in long-term reductions in GDP.Dr Swati Dhingra is a research leader for The UK in a Changing Europe, Associate Professor, Department of Economics and Research Associate, Centre for Economic Performance at LSE.

The index is a measure of inflation calculated by tracking the price of a selected basket of goods and services.Beer prices rose 0.6 per cent\u0026nbspbetween January and February compared with a decline of 1.1 per cent\u0026nbsplast year. Annually, food and alcohol inflation hit 1.1 per cent\u0026nbspand 5.1 per cent\u0026nbsprespectively.The price of food was up 0.4 per cent between January and February compared with 0.1 per cent last year. Alcohol and tobacco were up\u0026nbsp0.9 per cent increase on the month versus flat prices in February 2018.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said: “While February’s rise in inflation may be marginally disappointing for consumer purchasing power, it is still looking appreciably better than in mid-2018 – especially as earnings growth retained its firmer tone in January. Real earnings growth is currently 1.5 per cent, the best level since end-2016, although still appreciably below longterm norms.”Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersHe added that different Brexit outcomes were likely to affect CPI in the coming months.He said: “Our suspicion is that inflation will spike significantly higher if the UK leaves the EU without a deal,\u0026nbspprimarily due to a likely marked fall in sterling – even though the government has indicated that under a temporary scheme, 87 per cent\u0026nbspof imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access compared to 80 per cent\u0026nbspof imports currently being tariff-free.”Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “The rate of inflation is stable, with a modest rise in food as well as alcohol and tobacco offset by clothing and footwear prices rising by less than they did a year ago.”Upward pressure also came from recreation and culture, as prices rose between January and February 2019 compared with a smaller rise between the same two months last year. Computer games had the biggest effect.But clothing and footwear prices had a downward effect. Although pricetags were higher in February as usual, following the January sales, the increase was smaller than the same period last year.Annually, clothing and footwear prices dropped 2 per cent.At the pumps, motorists saw lower fuel costs last month, as petrol fell by 0.5p per litre on the month to 119.1p. Diesel also fell by 0.2p to 129.3p.The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was 2.4 per cent, down from 2.5 per cent\u0026nbspin January. It is the lowest since October 2016, when it was 2.2 per cent.It comes ahead of the Bank of England’s interest rate decision on Thursday, when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.KPMG UK’s chief economist Yael Selfin said the central bank may need to act more aggressively in future.She said: “Our expectations are for inflation to average around the Bank of England’s 2 per cent\u0026nbsptarget this year but to rise further in 2020, putting pressure on them to act more aggressively than markets currently anticipate.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

Nor is the belief that it remains one even now. Knowledgeable historians calculated that it was once the greatest empire in human history, if one takes into account both the territory it controlled and the time its\u0026nbspdomination lasted.\u0026nbspAdventurous political analysts have argued that in recent times Russia is inclined to regain its imperial powers. As Zbigniew Brzesinski, the former\u0026nbspnational security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, put it in 1997: “without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire … however, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, ning Europe and Asia.”\u0026nbspThe annexation of Crimea is apparent evidence of this process.Yet many observers believe the present “empire” (ie the Russian Federation) might itself collapse once more, dissolving into different parts. Some politicians hope that it will.Very few, however, attempt to understand the nature of the Russian imperial project – and the similarities and differences between the Russian empire and the other European ones.The most striking similarity between the Russian and the western imperial histories – the one that is arguably critical to any European adventure of the kind – is the fact that they were clearly ided into two discrete, consecutive phases.\u0026nbspWhat the Roman empire can tell us about modern middle eastThe first was the period of settler colonisation, by which the applicable imperial power subjugates great landmasses either on its own continent or overseas, and relocates there significant numbers of people, to the point they are able to outnumber the indigenous tribes. This was the case for the Russians in Siberia, for the French in Louisiana and Canada, for the British in the Thirteen Colonies, Australia and New Zealand, as well as, in some senses, for the Spanish in Latin America.\u0026nbspAll these appropriations were made between the early 16th and mid-18th centuries and resulted in what Angus Maddison called “the western offshoots”.\u0026nbspThe second phase involved more straightforward military conquest this tended to see locals being dominated by relatively small regular armies and a complicated system of vassalage (like in the case of the British Raj in India). Here Russia followed the western path as well: just as the French conquered Indochina and west Africa and the British took huge parts of Asia, from modern Pakistan to Malaya, and of Africa, from Kenya to Rhodesia, so the Russians added to their empire both the Caucasus and parts of central Asia, confronting the British during the Pandjeh incident of 1885.In both phases, Russia was as European in its behaviour as either Great Britain or France: it built its empire directed by European logic and using European means of communication and warfare. Nevertheless, between the western method and the Russian approach there was one huge difference.Created with Sketch.Protests break out after Russia seize Ukraine warships Show all 32Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Activists of opposition parties burn flares during a rally demanding to break an agreement with Russia on the use of the Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait, in front of the parliament building in KievVolunteers with the right-wing paramilitary Azov National Corps light flares during a rally on the snowy streets in front of the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev after Russia seized two of their armored artillery vessels and a tug boat in the Black SeaUkrainian Nationalists demand to break the diplomatic relations with Russia and nationalization of Russian property in UkraineUkrainian activists burn flares during their rally in front of Russian Consulate in KharkivSeized Ukrainian ships, small armoured artillery ships and a tug boat, are seen anchored in a port of KerchThe President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced, on 25 November, at a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council that they will introduce martial law in Ukraine for a period of 60 days and appeal to the Parliament to consider the moveRussia seized two small-sized \u0027Berdiansk\u0027 and \u0027Nikopol\u0027 armored artillery boats.

This forced the colonial powers to turn to military force effectively to create new, second empires – usually in different places.\u0026nbspIn Russia’s empire, meanwhile, neither its Siberian provinces nor the newly “reconciled” lands of today’s Ukraine and Belarus tried to secede.\u0026nbspTherefore, while Britain and France in fact possessed two different empires each, consecutively, the first and the second Russian empires (the first achieved through settler colonisation, the second through military action) were simply added to one another, rather like the traditional Russian matryoshka doll.\u0026nbspThis key difference between the imperial histories of Russia and the west helps to explain how the European powers have ended up where they are today.In particular, let’s consider the dissolution of the Soviet Union. With some minor exceptions, the borders of Russia now resemble those that existed in the mid-17th century, the time when the first empires of both Russia and the west powers were almost complete. Therefore, I would argue that the fall of the USSR was broadly the same process which evolved on a global scale between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970s and which is widely known as “decolonisation”\u0026nbsp(I dislike the word because I believe the European overseas appropriations of the time were not colonies, but rather military controlled possessions).\u0026nbspBut whereas this process ultimately left countries like Britain and France without empires at all, today’s Russia lost only its second – by retaining its first, it never lost its ambition for future re-expansion.For political elites in Russia and Ukraine, war still makes senseHere we should return to history.\u0026nbspThe Russian and the western empires were similar as it comes to the timings of their creation and to the methods of their construction – but they differ from each other in terms of the actors that stood behind the process.In western Europe the major nations (kingdoms then of course) had gained a clear national identity before they started their colonial adventures. Portugal, the oldest European nation state, fully sovereign since 1143, was the first to launch its overseas expansion. France emerged in full grandeur after peace with Britain in 1453 and the defeat of Burgundy in 1482 Spain became united in 1469 and Britain itself evolved as a single state after England was joined by Scotland and Ireland under James I in 1603.\u0026nbspWe can see this period as pre-imperial. By the time the Portuguese, the Spanish, the French, and the British sought to expand overseas, their own national unity was beyond question. This meant that when their first empires dissolved towards the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, little damage was done to the sense of national identity of the imperial bases. As a consequence, the later, “second” empires appeared in the same sense British and French, as were the earlier ones.Contemporary Russia remains and will remain an empire since it simply has no place to retreat toIn Russia, things followed a different path. Moscow, a small settlement at the time when the Kievan Rus’ (the medieval alliance of Slavic and Finnic groups) reached its apex in the 11th and 12th centuries, became stronger when the separated Russian princedoms fought for their liberation from the Mongols.\u0026nbspTill that time, the vast country we call Russia today was united not so much by national or even quasi-national identity, as by its Orthodox faith as well as by the belief that it had become the beacon of the “true” Christian faith after the fall of Constantinople.\u0026nbspThe Muscovites overthrew the Mongol domination in 1480 and less than a century later ruined the Mongol khanates in the Volga region and started their expansion to the east. It took them another 100\u0026nbspyears to reach the Pacific shores – but in the west they weren’t able to advance further than the current border between Russia and Belarus.\u0026nbsp“Russia” as the country’s name became widespread in the mid-17th century as all the three major centres of Russian statehood – Novgorod, Kiev and Vladimir – started to be governed from Moscow. But the key point about this development is that the Russian state emerged as an empire, was administered as an empire, and possessed many other imperial elements. In other words, Russia itself arose as an empire – built not by Russia, but rather by Muscovy. Therefore the first Russian empire was actually the empire of Moscow, and not the empire of Russia.The Muscovy-built empire called Russia consolidated itself during the 17th and 18th century, strengthening its domination both in its settler colonies in the east and in the “original” “Russian” lands in the west.\u0026nbspOnly as this consolidation process was actually completed did Russia begin\u0026nbspto conquer militarily neighbouring lands – from Finland in the North to the Caucasus in the south from Poland in the west to Bukhara and Kokand in the southeast.\u0026nbspAs such, the second Russian empire became an empire built by Russia, not Muscovy and in a self-fulfilling cycle, bolstered the sense of a “Russian” national identity.\u0026nbspThe imperial core of all the western European examples remained the same from beginning to end (Britain, France, Spain etc) in the Russian case, it changed from Muscovy to Russia. Therefore, in the 20th century it was not only Stalin’s will that ided the Soviet Union into different “Socialist Republics”, but rather Russia’s entire history. The vast “country” of the USSR consisted of the Russian republic, which had boundaries similar to the first Russian empire, and all the other republics which replicated the second Russian empire’s military possessions.\u0026nbspIt should be noted that while in the USSR-era Russian republic Russians themselves accounted for 81.5 per cent of the population according to the 1989 census. In none of the other Soviet republics did they make even a simple majority.\u0026nbspThis history and these demographics were the two major factors that made the Soviet Union ready for speedy disintegration after 1989.From all this, three crucial conclusions can be drawn.First, contemporary Russia remains and will remain an empire since it simply has no place to retreat to. As Russia lost its possessions in 1991 it returned to an entity territorially similar to one that started the last wave of expansion in the late 18th century.\u0026nbspOn the face of it, it looks like all the other European empires which, during the “decolonisation” of the 20th century were pushed back to those territorial limits from which they began. But while the western imperial cores were and always had been nation states, (some of them democracies and even republics), Russia was itself an empire when it started to expand two and a half centuries ago.\u0026nbspA socially acceptable form of murderRussia detains two US Mormons as tensions flare US generals ‘thinking about possibility of nuclear war’Russia orders all orcas and belugas kept in \u0027whale prison\u0027 be set freeThe Russians are European people who share the major European values and principles – but nevertheless Russia as a country arose not as a nation based on these values but as an empire driven by a thirst for power and expansion.\u0026nbspIf a nation state builds an empire and fails, it comes back to being a (hopefully better) nation state, one which transcends imperial aspirations. But if an empire constructs an even bigger empire and fails, it reemerges as an offended, revanchist and aggressive empire – exactly as Russia now looks like.The second I draw is that we should not expect Russia to fall apart, as many current observers suggest. Even though the country remains multiethnic, the Russians make up the majority of the population in almost every part of the country. I cannot think of any cases in which truly consolidated, culturally homogenous country collapses and is ided into parts unless as the result of a war (a prospect for which there are no markers).\u0026nbspInstances of countries existing as ided entities but being inhabited by the same ethnic group or people were all caused by military conflicts (East and West Germany, South and North Korea, North\u0026nbspand South\u0026nbspVietnam, continental China and Taiwan).\u0026nbspNo foreign force could at present defeat Russia militarily and cut it into parts moreover, the fear of external powers is so huge in today’s Russia that those parts of the country that used to have some inclination for greater autonomy (like\u0026nbspeastern Siberia or the far\u0026nbspeast), no longer do.\u0026nbspAnxiety in those areas about the growing influence of China outweighs any concerns about growing pressure from and “exploitation” by the (imperial) centre. As Russia becomes weaker in the economic and political sense, any outsider hopes for its dismemberment actually fade.The final conclusion is the most important and it is this. There is, despite everything, a crucial weakness in the existing political construct of the Russian “Federation”. Inside this federation there are still several regions that look completely alien to it – those that were acquired not during the first wave of empire-building but during the second.\u0026nbspThese territories are the entire north Caucasus, which was attached to Russia as a result of bloody wars in the mid-19th century, and the Republic of Tuva at the border with Mongolia that first became part of the Soviet Union in 1944. The north Causasus lands are by no means “Russian”: today the complete share of the ethnic Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian population in the “Russian” republic of Ingushetia is a mere 0.9 per cent. Compare this with\u0026nbspremote Kyrgyzstan, a sovereign nation in central Asia, where it accounts for close to 6 per cent.\u0026nbspThese parts of the current Russia are elements of the second empire which were incorporated into the first one due to a historical mistake. Things were nearly different: in early 1990s, as Chechnya revolted against the Russian rule, it was thought other regional republics were ready to follow – but it never happened. \u0026nbspNow, Russia claims it “re-established” its control over its former military possessions, although in reality it pays countless tribute to local “khans” and “emirs”. In the end though, these remnants of the second Russia empire will surely secede at some stage.\u0026nbspIn sum then, Russia is a unique creature: not so much superior to other European empires, but drastically different from them. These differences shouldn’t be either neglected or denied one should look on the country sine ira et studio for exploring its European nature and history and for understanding what might be expected from it in the future.\u0026nbspRussia is the last existing empire – and an empire that lasts, if not forever, than for longer than its western equivalents. It should not be criticised for this, but explored and investigated.Vladislav Inozemtsev’s new book, with Alexander Abalov, is ‘The Last Empire’, published\u0026nbspin Russian\u0026nbspby Alpina Publishing House.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightFirst spotted by BGR, the patent suggests Apple could introduce the biggest revamp to its Face ID technology since it was first launched in 2017 with the iPhone X.Face ID currently consists of a sensor that invisibly projects and scans a grid of infrared dots onto a person’s face. It is able to identify different facial features, as well as glasses, clothing, makeup and facial hair.Up until now, Face ID has struggled to differentiate between identical twins, though Apple claims it is still significantly more advanced than its Touch ID fingerprint scanner.The creating and storing of facial maps have inevitably led to concerns from privacy advocates, who worry about the implications if such data was accidentally leaked and fell into the hands of malicious actors.“I think we should be quite worried,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspwhen the technology was first announced.“The chances we are going to see mischief around facial data is pretty high – if not today, then soon, and if not on Apple then on Android.”It is not clear whether Apple plans to introduce the new subepidermal\u0026nbsptechnology to Face ID in its 2019 range of iPhones and iPads, as the company\u0026nbspdoes not comment on rumours surrounding forthcoming products.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This, however, needs to be further investigated.”Humans share almost all of our DNA with cats, cattle and miceResearcher Derry Taylor monitored 22 of the animals - native to South East Asia - in\u0026nbspspontaneous social play sessions.The bears, aged up to 12, were housed in Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre in Malaysia in which enclosures were large enough to allow bears to choose whether to interact or not.During hundreds of play bouts, two distinct expressions were coded – one involving a display of the upper incisor teeth, and one without - with the bears most likely to show precise facial mimicry during gentle play.Mr Taylor said such subtle mimicking could be to help two bears signal that they are ready to play more roughly, or to strengthen social bonds.He said: “It is widely believed that we only find complex forms of communication in species with complex social systems.As sun bears are a largely solitary species, our study of their facial communication questions this belief, because it shows a complex form of facial communication that until now was known only in more social species.”The results were published on Thursday in the online journal Scientific Reports.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The odds remain small but not insignificant – around one-tenth of 1 per cent.Only slightly wider than the height of the Empire State Building, Bennu is not big enough to destroy Earth but could cause huge destruction.Its size makes it the smallest body to ever be orbited by a spacecraft, Nasa said.Studying Bennu with Osiris-Rex will allow researchers to learn more about the origins of our solar system, the sources of water and organic molecules on Earth, and the hazards and resources in near-Earth space, the space agency said.Nasa\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbsphost\u0026nbspa media conference at 5.30pm GMT to announce further details about the agency\u0027s mission to return the spacecraft to Earth.We’ll tell you what’s true.

If measurements from this field cannot be considered absolute, it could change how the discipline operates.“It seems that, in contrast to classical physics, measurement results cannot be considered absolute truth but must be understood relative to the observer who performed the measurement,” said Dr Ringbauer.“The stories we tell about quantum mechanics have to adapt to that.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic.

Not all companies are prepared for the worstWith a week to go, the prime minister has finally sought to delay Brexit. As things stand, however, there is no formal agreement between the government and the EU about the length of any Article 50 extension.So, what\u0026nbspwould\u0026nbspa Brexit delay do to inidual businesses in terms of\u0026nbspcontingency planning?Not much, is the answer.\u0026nbspOne thing to understand is that a lot of businesses simply haven’t done any.When the Institute of Directors (IoD) looked at this question earlier in the year it found 40 per cent of its members had taken no steps at all to prepare for a sudden no-deal situation.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThat may seem like extraordinary complacency, given the wretched state of a\u0026nbspUK government\u0026nbspled by arguably the worst prime minister in history. And in some cases, that’s probably true. (There is still the feeling that “it just won’t happen” in some quarters.)\u0026nbspBut there is a much larger slate of smaller firms that simply lack the resources to be able to plan effectively\u0026nbspfor the\u0026nbsplooming earthquake.\u0026nbspWatchdog bans advert encouraging loans to fund Brexit food stockpilesWe’re just over a week away from the notional exit date and it’s still the case that no one really\u0026nbsphas the faintest idea how (or when) this will end, and what the impact will be. That being the case, small firms have opted to take a wait and see approach. They will react to what emerges, because they don’t have much of a choice.\u0026nbspThe IoD, and the Scottish National Party, have called for businesses to be issued with prep vouchers, along the lines of\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspschemes the Irish and Dutch governments have put into operation.\u0026nbspThese, the IoD says, could persuade some to act in the event of a short delay by incentivising them to take preparatory measures.\u0026nbspWhatever is agreed, those businesses that are prepping will continue to do so. Those that aren’t will carry on crossing their fingersBut that looks unlikely at present. For a start, the EU doesn’t seem minded to agree to a short extension\u0026nbspand such a scheme would be an example of something the current government seems allergic to: forward-thinking policy-making.Suren Thiru, from the British Chambers of Commerce, says those that have been preparing for no deal will continue to do so if a delay is secured. That means a continuation of the weak investment that is slowing the UK economy to a crawl as resources are erted to emergency planning.\u0026nbspThe problem for all businesses, as he points out, is that there are just “so many key questions to which we don’t have answers”. How will trade work, how will customs work, how will\u0026nbspfirms lay their hands on the staff they need?The prospect of a “rolling”, non-date-specific delay fills businesses with almost as much horror as no deal (which\u0026nbspmost regard as the equivalent of Hereditary, The Exorcist\u0026nbspand Children of the Corn all merged into one).\u0026nbspSo whatever is agreed, those businesses that are prepping will keep doing so. Those that aren’t will carry on crossing their fingers in the hope of Westminster coming to its senses.\u0026nbspThey’d probably best cross their toes, and anything else they can lay their hands on while they’re at it.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

fresh referendum supporters delighted - while minister floats extraordinary plan to suspend parliament and start a new sessionClick to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May’s hopes of forcing MPs to back\u0026nbspher Brexit deal by staging repeat votes are in tatters, after speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow dramatically blocked the tactic, citing rules dating back to before the Gunpowder Plot.The prime minister was left stunned by the shock announcement – which torpedoed her hopes of a third “meaningful vote” while threatening MPs with a long delay to leaving the EU if they refused to give way.The dramatic twist, outlawing fresh votes without substantial changes, left ministers scrabbling for solutions – including an extraordinary proposal to suspend parliament and start a new session.It also achieved the remarkable feat of uniting supporters of a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum, who both believed it made their favoured option more likely.The solicitor general, who warned of “a constitutional crisis”, put forward the escape route of ending the current parliamentary session early to get around the 1604 convention invoked by the speaker, which lapses after a fresh Queen’s Speech.Here’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit ruling“There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session,” said Robert Buckland.Created with

12-day session to pass legislation to reduce the power\u0026nbspof the House of Lords.No 10 is also mulling a possible vote to overturn the speaker’s ruling – but this seemed only likely to succeed if there are enough supporters of the deal in the first place.There was no immediate official response from Downing Street, other than to express its fury that Mr Bercow gave no warning of his bombshell announcement, made in the Commons chamber.The speaker said a further meaningful vote\u0026nbspwould be ruled out of order if the motion was “the same or substantially the same” – under a 1604 convention to stop the government bullying parliament on issues MPs have rejected.Ms May has already admitted that the negotiations with the EU are over, making it hard for her to argue that a further meaningful vote will be on a different question.Crucially, the speaker suggested something would have to be renegotiated with the EU to constitute a “change”, rather than, for example, a clarification of legal advice by the attorney general.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?French EU minister names cat ‘Brexit’ because of its indecisive natureMr Bercow told MPs: “What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.”The Independent revealed in January that pro-EU MPs believed that Ms May’s tactic to bludgeon her deal through, despite heavy defeats, was barred by parliamentary rules.Senior Tories were livid, believing the speaker had once again laid bare his anti-Brexit bias while twisting constitutional rules to suit his purpose.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, taunted Mr Bercow by tweeting: “‘When I use a word,’\u0026nbspHumpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean.’”He added: “In the normal course of events, as the speaker says, parliament says no, and the issue is dropped.“But in this case, this is not an option, because these votes respond to an instruction in a referendum, endorsed by parliament, which rules out dropping back to the status quo.”Supporters of a Final Say referendum were delighted, with former Tory MP Anna Soubry telling\u0026nbspThe Independent: “It puts a second referendum very firmly at the top of the agenda –\u0026nbspit must do. We need a way out of this and this is the only way out.”Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister and People’s Vote supporter, said: “It is inconceivable now for ministers to carry on trying to force this broken Brexit deal on the people of the United Kingdom.”And David Lammy, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “If the prime minister wants us to vote on her deal again, she should add an amendment allowing for her deal to be put to the people.”In the short term, the speaker’s intervention killed off any prospect of a third meaningful vote this week – already in doubt as the Democratic Unionist Party failed to switch sides.It appears certain that Ms May will have to ask EU leaders for a long\u0026nbspextension – anything between nine\u0026nbspand 21 months – to the Article 50 process at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The new departure date will then be put to a “take-it-or-leave-it vote” in the Commons and Lords next week, just days before the 29 March Brexit day.For that reason, it increases the chances of a crash-out Brexit, which the Treasury has predicted could\u0026nbsptrigger a near 10 per cent GDP decline.However, a long extension could also open up the space for a further referendum, which some believe the prime minister might yet embrace if it is the only hope of passing her agreement.Speaking to a silent Commons, Mr Bercow said repeat votes had been blocked on 12 occasions up until 1920 – a situation only not repeated since because of “general compliance”.“This convention is very strong and longstanding, dating back to 2 April 1604,” the speaker said.“It’s a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of house time and the proper respect for the decision which it takes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

We prefer a referendum than revocation, he said.But if that isn’t possible, parliamentarians may need to revoke article 50 in order to protect the country from no deal.”Also arriving at the EU summit, the German chancellor Angela Merkel said: To the\u0026nbsplast hour, we must do everything to ensure that there can be an orderly British\u0026nbspexit from the EU.\u0026nbspArriving at the European Council\u0026nbspsummit in Brussels,\u0026nbspLatvian prime minister Krisjanis Karins says that if MPs reject Theresa May\u0027s deal again next week, they will have to choose between revoking Article 50 or leaving with no deal.\u0026nbspHe says:If the UK is leaving we would want that to be an orderly process so there has been a Withdrawal Agreement agreed over a two-year period - I don\u0027t see any chance of changing that.So the question is will the UK accept this agreement and then it will be an orderly withdrawal? No-one wants a chaotic withdrawal.Asked what would happen if the deal is rejected, Mr Karins said:There are then two alternatives: either Great Britain withdraws Article 50 and stays in the European Union or there is a disorderly withdrawal.On the decision of Jeremy Corbyn to leave a meeting last night in the Commons with the prime minister - due to the presence of The Independent Group -\u0026nbspLabour Party chairman Ian Lavery said at the party\u0027s local election launch: You might perhaps wish to say that Jeremy was juvenile, but what I would say is that Jeremy had agreed with the PM the certain criteria... she broke the agreement immediately.Jeremy spoke to Theresa May almost immediately after the meeting last night.There was a lengthy conversation - Jeremy put a whole number of points to Theresa May.The reality is Jeremy is trying to resolve this in the best interests of everybody - not just the 48 per cent\u0026nbspnot just the 52 per cent\u0026nbsp- we need to get together, we need to get rid of this horrible hatred and this toxic nature right through our communities - that\u0027s what Jeremy is doing.To call him juvenile is widely inaccurate, and I\u0027m being extremely polite.No 10 has defended Theresa May\u0027s televised address on Wednesday evening - saying it had been\u0026nbspintended as a message to the public to explain why she was seeking a delay to Brexit.What the PM was doing was setting out to the public that while we are not going to be able to leave with a deal on time on March 29 she is not prepared to support an extension beyond June 30, the spokeswoman said.It is three years since the referendum and the public want us to bring this to a conclusion and that is what she was setting out yesterday.The spokeswoman dismissed claims that the prime minister\u0027s remarks could put MPs at risk of attack by angry members of the public. I flatly reject that, she said.There\u0027s no evidence to suggest that, it was added. “I set out clearly what the prime minister was doing yesterday, which was setting out the details of the extension and her own personal regret about that.”The spokeswoman also revealed the prime minister is expected to hold one-on-one talks with French president Emmanuel Macron, and the European council president Donald Tusk - ahead of the EU Council summit in Brussels later today.\u0026nbspCommons leader Andrea Leadsom tells MPs they will be not be sitting on Friday 29 March - the date Britain is currently set to exit the EU. It\u0027s fair to say some MPs found this amusing.\u0026nbspShe did not provide a date for a third meaningful vote on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal, but told MPs the precise timing depends on the outcome of talks in Brussels.Referring to the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt\u0027s remarks on BBC Radio 4 this morning, the Labour MP and supporter of the pro-EU group Best for Britain\u0026nbspVirendra Sharma, said:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThese comments will go down like a bucket of sick. What the Foreign Secretary means is that no Prime Minister in living memory has failed on the same scale as Theresa May.\u0026nbspYesterday\u0027s attack on Parliament was an act of desperation, where she tried to pass the buck to MPs. That\u0027s not leadership.There\u0027s now no doubt that the Prime Minister has led this country into crisis. MPs cannot continue playing her game. We need a sufficient extension to Article 50, and for this decision to be put back to the people through a final say.Please allow a moment for the liveblog\u0026nbspto loadWe’ll tell you what’s true.

So far as we’re concerned, we think there’s an urgency in constructing a majority for an agreeable solution and that’s what we’re concentrating on at the moment,” he said when asked about the move.Asked again, he replied: “We think that what we’re proposing can be achieved in the British parliament, we do believe we can construct a majority which will prevent the crashing out and all the chaos that will come from crashing out.”Mr Corbyn visited the EU capital on Thursday at the same time as Theresa May, meeting with senior European Commission officials like Michel Barnier and Martin Selmayr. He also met with senior centre-left prime ministers at their pre-summit gathering.What you need to know about stopping Brexit and revoking Article 50Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, who is also in the EU capital, told The Independent that he would prefer a new referendum to revoking Article 50, but that MPs “may” have go ahead with a revocation as a last resort.“It’s a last resort. We prefer a referendum than revocation,” he said. “But if that isn’t possible, parliamentarians may need to revoke article 50 in order to protect the country from no deal.”The European Court of Justice ruled last year that Britain\u0026nbspcould unilaterally revoke Article 50 – effectively ending the Brexit process and keeping the UK in the EU until it was triggered again. A mere extension to the negotiating period however requires the consent of the other 27 EU member states.Britain will leave the EU if\u0026nbspthe Article 50 period is allowed to expire – with or without a deal in place.Created with Sketch.

Officials believe such incidents are on the rise.Other people have suffered serious injuries while taking selfies with elephants.Earlier studies have found wildlife tourism causes fear, alertness, aggression, vigilance and stress behaviour in animals including rhinos.Ms Szott, whose research was published in the Journal of Zoology, said elephants at waterholes could experience frustration and stress, as well as being targeted by other herd members, increasing the risk of aggression towards people in vehicles.“We suggest a consistent minimum distance from the nearest inidual, especially upon first approach, should be introduced to guidelines for wildlife viewing to alleviate the potential for conflict,” she said.\u0026nbspAudrey Delsink, head of wildlife for\u0026nbspHumane Society InternationalAfrica, told The Independent: “Stress can be caused to animals if the guide or tourists approach too close to the elephants, coming between females and calves or cutting off exit routes, and it’s that sort of irresponsible behaviour on the part of people that encourages negative responses in elephants.“Wildlife tourism should not in itself cause an issue if conducted according to strict codes of conduct regulating how elephants should be viewed, such as safe-distance observation.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It happens when it rains hard.But this spring, the poppies have been so abundant and so strikingly coloured – orange peel, marigold and burned copper – that the number of people coming to walk among them has simply been too many.\u0026nbspAs a result, the city was forced to say “no” to visitors, after what some officials termed a “super bloom apocalypse”.“The city has expended all available resources to address the #SuperBloom,” they wrote on the the city’s Instagram page. “We have brought in all available staff, as many outside traffic controllers that we could, more shuttles, and our small city can not sustain crowds of this magnitude – our city is not made for Disneyland-size crowds.”It urged residents: “Please, we need your help and understanding. This is beyond our control.

Residents have complained about traffic jams, as visitors have arrived as early as 5.30am to visit the wildflowers, whose burst of growth was triggered by recent record-breaking rainfall. One person was reportedly hurt in a traffic accident.For the last few weeks, crowds have swarmed onto the fields, many ignoring\u0026nbsp instructions that they stay on the designated path. Some have even picked the flowers to take home.\u0026nbspMayor Steve Manos told The Independent he had never known a\u0026nbspbloom as spectacular as the one this year. “It only happens when it rains hard,” he said. “The last one was 2017, and before that it was 2010.”“People were pulled over on the side of the road to see the flowers as we drove here,” she said. “It was amazing to see the number of flowers grow as we got closer.”Mr Manos, mayor of the city located 70 miles to the south east of Los Angeles, posted videos of himself helping direct traffic on Facebook, to try and give an insight into how bad the situation was.\u0026nbspOn Monday morning, amid some criticism over the shutdown, the city said access to Walker Canyon had been reopened, though parking was extremely limited.\u0026nbspMr Manos appeared in another brief video, standing in front of people walking through the footpaths amid the flowers.REDIRECT Nature Studies by Michael McCarthy: A Western Isles idyllWild flowers are overpowered by exhaust fumesBritain’s most common wild flowers are latest species to disappearThe last stand of the wild flower“As you can see, there are a number of people behind me here to experience the bloom.\u0026nbspBut we are full.

Or was it just another slip of the tongue by the former vice president with a reputation for veering off script?In a keynote speech at a dinner for the Delaware Democratic Party on Saturday, Mr Biden boasted he has “the most progressive record of anybody running.”The only problem is Mr Biden has not announced whether he will launch a third run for the White House, despite repeatedly teasing the possibility.He quickly corrected himself, clarifying that he meant to say “anybody who would run,” then adding “I didn’t mean it” while a cheering crowd in his home state nearly drowned him out.Although Mr Biden has been known to go off script, his remark is likely to be viewed as a Washington-style gaffe – a case of accidentally telling the truth.Created with Sketch.Who could be running against Trump in 2020?

At one point, Mr Khasikov could have claimed political credentials for the job.In 2011,\u0026nbsphe was the proud owner of a PhD in political science from the Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. Alas, that degree was taken away from him\u0026nbspfive years later,\u0026nbspafter an academic panel discovered his dissertation had heavily plagiarised another piece of research.\u0026nbsp“I understand that the multiple world champion had no time to concern himself with academic work,” Sergei Stepanov, one of the members of the panel, said at the time. “I can only assume that Batu not only didn’t write but also didn’t read his own work.”1st Operational Police Regiment in MoscowMr Khasikov’s appointment is the latest change\u0026nbspin a mass rotation\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspRussia’s ruling\u0026nbspelite. The\u0026nbspshakeup,\u0026nbsparguably the most fundamental since Mikhail Gorbachev embarked on perestroika reforms in the 1980s,\u0026nbsphas been linked to Mr Putin’s falling ratings and the country’s\u0026nbspcontinuing economic malaise.\u0026nbspEarly in Mr Putin’s reign, governors were often fiercely independent figures, their regional power bases acting as a check on the president’s authority. Today, things are slightly different. The vast majority of the newest regional appointees have come directly from Russia’s security or military agencies.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

and sparked a furious race to get a Brexit deal through within this timeframe.With no deal agreement in sight, MPs endorsed Theresa Mays plan to ask Brussels for an extension to the Article  process on March , .The move means Britain WONT quit the EU on March  - as the PM has promised for the past two years.Mrs May will next week bring her Brexit deal back to the Commons for a third meaningful vote.She says thatit passes, she will then ask the EU for a short technical extension until the end of June, to give Parliament the time to force through the necessary legislation.Butthe deal is defeated again, the PM has warned that Britain will have to stay in the EU beyond the summer and take part in European Parliament elections.It is still possible for EU leaders to block Mrs Mays request for a delay when they meet in Brussels next week.But most have signalled they will accept a relatively brief extension as long as Britain is still on track to leave with a deal.Extending Article  would give Parliament more time to finalise a deal, though at this stage its not clear how much time will help.Its also not clearBritain will have to hold elections to the European Parliamentthe UK is still a member state in May.On March , , it was reported that over one million people had signed a petition on to revoke Article  in a bid to cancel Brexit.The Remainer stunt actually crashed the UK government’s petitions website several times, according to .It was supported by celebs such as actor Hugh Grant, comedian Jenner Saunders and Professor Brian Cox.May has faced criticism  from both the Remain and Leave camps for triggering Article  too early.Those against the move have argued that rather than initiating the withdrawal, May should wait until there was a cabinet agreement on the UKs stance and they had their ducks in order.But there was also considerable pressure for May to trigger the withdrawal immediately by those who were impatient to leave the EU.In fact most MPs seemed to want it at the time, with  of our lawmakers voting for the Article  bill in February .Now the encroaching deadline has seen panicked MPs take part in a number of votes to find a solution to the Brexit stalemate.They wont agree on Theresa Mays meaningful vote - or at least have rejected the first two shed agreed with Europe.This week they also took a No Deal and second referendum off the table and finally agreed to extend Article  Its a controversial move for those who voted to Leave the EU, as well as Remainers who are not much enjoying the spectacle.It could cost us too - Brussels is expected to slap an extra £.billion on top of the agreed £billion pay-offwe stay for an extra four months.Furious Brexiteers warned on Saturday night that suspending Article  beyond March  departure date would rob public services of much needed cash.Tory MP Esther McVey said: “Not only is extending Article  a betrayal of the British public, it is a hugely expensive betrayal.“That money would be far better spent on our police, our prisons locking up those who commit kne crimes and our hard-pressed schools.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000476176260.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"andrea leadsom dont need brextra time brexit","story":"It was a symbol that leaving the EU wasn’t a pipe-dream, but a reality.In triggering Article , the Prime Minister held firm to her promise of honouring the referendum result.March  spoke to that — that no matter how tough things were, no matter how dficult the negotiations got, there was light at the end of the tunnel.But this week, that certainty has been removed.Worse still, Parliament has offered nothing in .The right thing to do would have been to leave on March  with the Prime Minister’s deal.I’ve always made clear that I am in Government to support the Prime Minister to deliver Brexit, and I’m not about to give up now.It’s an uncomfortable fact that leaving the European Union in a way that is true to the referendum result is becoming harder and harder to deliver.By refusing to vote for the Prime Minister’s deal — for reasons of party politics or idealism — we are now forced to face up to some brutal truths.I want to be straight with the country about what they are.Firstly, taking No Deal off the table does not change the fact the legal-default departure date is March .So we have to agree a deal before then — or extend Article .The only deal on the table is the one the Prime Minister has spent two and a half years negotiating. Starting over is just not an option — andNo Deal is unpalatable toMPs, then the obvious solution is to support leaving with a deal.Secondly, a y delay puts us in the awkward position of having to stand candidates for the European Parliament election.This would be a humiliation and the public would be right to be furious.Worse still, as part of an offer for a long extension, the EU may require us to hold a second referendum.Thirdly, we came dangerously close to a backbencher coup — where those who did not win the right to govern wish to take over the role of government, in an extra-ordinarily unconstitutional move that would overturn years of parliamentary conventions with the sole aim of stopping Brexit.Make no mistake, their motives were not to deliver a dferent Brexit or to honour the result of the referendum — it would be to stop Brexit in its tracks. All the while, our hard-working voters and our long-suffering businesses just want to get on with le beyond Brexit.In a survey by market researchers Survation, the majority of Conservative voters said they would take Theresa May’s deal over every other option — No Deal, a long delay or another referendum.There is, however, an obvious solution to all this — and every parliamentarian can choose to take it.I spend my days at the legislative coalface as Leader of the House of Commons. I know what we need to get done to leave the EU in a smooth fashion — and I also know that we do not need is a y extension.While the negotiators have been hard at it in Brussels, I’ve been preparing for and delivering the legislative changes needed for Brexit to make sure our laws work when we leave.So I know thatwe get this deal passed next week, we can deliver Brexit quickly — and potentially much faster than the end of June.If both Houses — the Lords and the Commons — acknowledge the country’s desire to get this settled, we can crack on with passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.A short extension to get the legislation finalised is far better than a long one — which would come with unacceptable conditions we have no control over.In setting out the parliamentary timetable, I will, as I always do, fully respect Parliament’s desire to scrutinise and debate.But I will also be looking to move quickly, so Parliament can turn its attention to the wealth of opportunity that awaits us when we leave the EU.As I said at the dispatch box this week, this is an important time for Parliament and there have been dficult decisions to make.With such strongly held views across the House, it’s vital that we continue to listen to each other with respect and understanding.Over the centuries, the country has looked on as Parliament has faced historic decisions.Even in the most challenging of times, we have pulled together and put our duty above all .So I hope the House will now find a consensus that delivers on the will of the people to leave the EU as close to March  as possible.We can then, finally, turn our eyes to the bright future ahead of us and seek to reinstate confidence in British politics.Let’s do our duty — and do our country proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We all stand united as brothers and sisters”.Her defiant words are a fitting epitaph for the New Zealand victims: “We must tell them you will not win.”ENOUGH is enough on the Brexit shambles. We want out as soon as possible.A poll today shows that  per cent want PM Theresa May to ignore MPs and leave the EU without a deal.Buther exit plan does not get past Parliament, Britain’s departure could be postponed for two years. As Andrea Leadsom says, a y delay would be humiliating.MPs must unite behind the deal on the table — or waste the chance of a letime to wave goodbye to Brussels.Sort it. Anything  is a betrayal.TRAGIC Jade Goody’s most worthwhile legacy is sadly being squandered.The -year-old’s death from cervical cancer ten years ago was a wake-up call for millions of women. But the smear test rates that shot up after she lost her le have now plummeted to record lows.Backed by this newspaper, the NHS is urging women to take the le-saving test.So our message is don’t delay, go today.

It would be an Establishment stitch-up, with serious consequences for the public’s faith in democracy for decades to come.For those Labour supporters who voted to leave, it’s a reminder that the party’s MPs are desperate to overturn the result of the ‘People’s Vote’ in June .There are some notable exceptions. But the vast majority are determined to frustrate Brexit, regardless of the result of our biggest ever democratic exercise.Labour is now far more interested in north London than the north of England.The threat of Remainers wrecking our departure gets more pressing by the day.Brexiteers must accept reality and back the best Brexit possible: the PM’s deal.MIKE Thalassitis’ suicide is a wake-up call for Britain’s TV companies — and the country at large.Suicide is the single biggest killer of men under  in the UK. But it’s not just blokes. A fth of adolescent girls say they have self-harmed, a path to more serious acts later in le.Britain has come a long way in recent years on mental health. But those statistics show there is plenty of work to do. We’re thrilled to launch our Let’s Talk campaign with Papyrus to do our bit.The pressures of modern le are even more pressing for those who are thrust suddenly into the spotlight.That’s the lesson not just of today’s news but of Love Island star Sophie Gradon’s death last year.The companies that make millions off these young men and women have a duty of care to them. It’s clear from the criticism we’ve seen since Mike’s untimely death that those outfits MUST take their responsibilities more seriously.Chloe Goodman knows better than most. And we back her call for mandatory counselling for reality stars.This tragedy must be the last.FACEBOOK are asking for our gratitude after eventually taking down videos of the horric terrorist attack in Christchurch.Which doesn’t change the fact it took far too long for them to do so, nor that it was streamed in the first place.It is ridiculous that these s continue to dodge the responsibilities that come with being a publisher, even though boss Mark Zuckerberg has admitted that that is exactly what they are.The Government MUST step in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Run for your lives.“But it really isn’t like that.”Oh, OK, you could maybe take your chances listening to her Fanny impression then. Talking of which, This Morning’s Martin Lewis. There’s a strong argument to say he should have been made to do If I Were A Rich Man, from Fiddler On The Roof. And an equally strong one to say he really shouldn’t. But he ended up doing Any Dream Will Do, from Joseph, and oh-my-s**tting dachshund he was bad. Talking point of the night, evenCorrie’s Daniel Brocklebank won, was Alan Titch-marsh singing Some Enchanted Evening, from South Pacic, on a stretch of thoughtfully placed decking.A man overcome with emotion. The main one being anger by the look on his face.Like next door’s kids had just punted their football straight into his prize begonias, it was.The audience went nuts for it, though, the judges were in floods of overwhelmed tears and, must admit, even I was aware I was watching something that would be played again and again, for both good and bad reasons.But I must urge caution here. Antony Cotton got his own ITV chat show after winning Soapstar Superstar.It just needed Simon Cowell tuning in on Sunday, and, before you know it, he’s got Titchmarsh back in the white blazer trying to Dream The Impossible Dream for the Christmas No.Still, we have to look for the positives, and what I’ll ultimately take from All Star Musicals is the fact John Barrowman appeared on telly, for two entire hours, and didn’t shout: “FAB-U-LOUS!” once.Progress. FRIDAY. This Morning’s Eamonn “Rip Van Winkle” Holmes: “If I eat before I go to bed I stand a better chance of falling into a deep sleep. Or am I just odd ”No, you’re corpulent as well.ROMESH Ranganathan broke with  years of Red Nose Day tradition and said something vaguely funny about Four Weddings And A Funeral on Friday night.“As a young Asian kid growing up in Crawley that film really spoke to me.”OK, not belly  laughs, but an acknowledgement that some of us don’t get Four Weddings and think we need a charity sequel about as much as Gregg Wallace needs a hairnet on Inside The Factory.Still, it was a chance to see what the ravages of time have done to almost everyone except Andie MacDowell, who certainly hasn’t spent the past  years taking acting lessons.The lesbian wedding plot was also entirely in keeping with the right-on tone of an event that’s so self-satisfied, starstruck and preachy you can understand why some people think Africa should go it alone rather than submit to Comic Relief’s condescension for all eternity.You’ll have to make your own judgment call on the true value of Red Nose Day, where the night’s grand total has been dropping ever since  and civilians have been almost vanished from the process entirely.Personally, I took inspiration from Sir Lenny Henry’s final words of the night: “See you in two years’ time maybe.”’Cos I heard that “maybe” and thought, “maybe not”. Channel ’s  Hours In Police ­Custody.The “fat ginger” ­playground line on Ricky ­Gervais’ new Netflix ­comedy After Le.Goggleboxer Lee dipping his Doritos in Jenny’s face pack.Scotland’s Finn Russell suddenly deciding he’d given England enough of a head start at - in an enthralling Calcutta Cup match.And Celebs Go Dating civilian Joe asking Love Island’s Georgia Steel, “What do you actually do ” and getting the perfect response  from narrator Rob Beckett: “In summary, f*** all.”b “Down Royal and Downpatrick in Northern Ireland host the racing of what animals ”Matt: “Cows.”Bradley Walsh: “What flying animal is the slang term for doing time in prison ”Rachel: “Monkey.”Bradley Walsh: “The hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah is most associated with which sport ”Shirley: “Fishing.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Colloquially known as ‘Dubya’, President George Bush used which middle initial to distinguish himself from his father ”Jacob: “J.” .CHANNEL ’s hugely entertaining series The Bachelor UK was further proof that men are  from Mars and women are from an as-yet- undiscovered galaxy many thousands of light years away.They seemed surprisingly keen to mate with Alex Marks, though, considering he looked like Captain Haddock with a man-bun, below, and would’ve been the most vacant lot on any planetit wasn’t for the presence of host Mark Wright.He had only one tactic with all of the women as well: Tell them “You’re beautul,” ask for “a hug,” then move in for the kill with Reanne, Robyn, Charlotte T, Charlotte E, mad Georgie the circus performer, and even shark-eyed Essex nightmare Alicia.It was working a treat as well, until Tuesday’s episode, when Alicia found Alex snogging Charlotte T and it all kicked off massively.Reanne took the smartest option available, in the circumstances, by immediately quitting  the show.Alicia  took the dumbest option available, by locking herself in the South African mansion’s bathroom.So she can probably be thankful it wasn’t a celebrity version of the show and Alex is hardly the sharpest tool in  the box.Because the gormless, great oaf  only went and ruined everything by picking Alicia ahead of talented, beautul and much nicer Charlotte T on Thursday night’s final.I’d give it until the end of the credits.INCIDENTALLY,you’re still trying to decide whether Baptiste is great TV or not, it’s not.Andyou don’t believe me, watch next Sunday’s far-fetched finale and try to avoid replying: “Not bloody soon enough” when Stratton screams: “God, when does it end ”Bet you can’t. SORRY.

Spoiler alert — they will not end up backing a harder exit.I know there are Leave voters who do not like Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Butyou do not like her deal, look at the alternative options for softer Brexits, which would be far worse for the country.If you think this deal risks the UK ­getting stuck in a customs union, just wait till you see what the deal would look like with Labour’s “permanent” customs union glued on top.Better to have an imperfect route to controlling our own trade policy than no route at all.If you do not like the fact that, under the PM’s deal, we would have to keep existing EU goods and agricultural rules, imagine staying in the Single Market or, as it is rebranded, Common Market .. We would lose the veto over goods rules which we have in the backstop, and be forced to follow rules on services too.Even in a worst-case scenario, Theresa May’s deal lets us escape the EU’s “ever closer union” political project and seize control of our own immigration policy.We would be in control of almost all our economy and not have to pay a penny for it on an ongoing basis.It is far better than most critics will admit. Thanks to changes secured at Strasbourg last week, we have new protections.The EU can no longer do what French President Macron arrogantly threatened. It will not be able to use the backstop as a “trap” to demand access to UK fishing waters.The EU cannot just say “non” to every sensible idea for resolving the Irish border issues. The so-called Star Chamber of MPs were quick to reject the Strasbourg changes.But they should listen to the Irish opposition party.Their Brexit spokesperson said: “We have come a long way” from a “bullet-proof, rock-solid, cast-iron backstop”.Or how about top barrister Lord ­Pannick  He is the QC who won the case for Gina Miller against the Government.He argues that in some circumstances the UK could terminate the deal through the so-called Vienna Convention.Conservative Eurosceptic big beasts, from ex-leader Michael Howard to former Chancellor Norman Lamont, have all weighed in behind the deal.David Davis, who resigned over ­Chequers, is now onside.Lord Trimble, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, has backed it. If he can live with the backstop, that should count for something.But some Eurosceptic back- benchers still refuse to support the PM’s deal.Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, they would prefer a harder deal. But face facts. There is no harder Brexit on offer.With No Deal out of reach, there is no incentive for the EU to provide any more concessions.That means the choices are this deal or a softer Brexit. Or no Brexit at all.And be sure that the Speaker, John Bercow, will bend every possible rule to frustrate Brexit.So, do not expect a long delay to offer a better answer.Anyway, the choice on our future could be made soon.There is no time to lose to save Brexit. Even a snap General Election offers no easy salvation. It would mean Theresa May leading the Tories into another campaign on a manesto of her deal — precisely what her critics want to avoid. And of course, the Conservatives could lose any path to power at all, kissing goodbye to any Brexit.Brexit would never have happenedit had not been for Boris Johnson.Now he has a crucial opportunity to save the whole project.He can show how he can be a ­statesman, by compromising in the national interest.And he can demonstrate the sort of leadership that won him so much praise as Mayor of London.If the Government can persuade the DUP to vote for the deal, backbenchers including Dominic Raab, Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers and Mark Harper should follow suit.Otherwise, they risk being remembered as the MPs who wrecked Brexit, along with Labour MPs who helped trigger ­Article  and then opposed both No Deal and the current deal.Theresa May also needs to recognise that backbenchers want someone  to take forward the next stage of the negotiations.If she tries to cling to power, critics on both sides of the Brexit ide may never back her deal.Whereasshe pledges to step down on getting her deal through, she can step down as a hero who delivered Brexit against the odds.MPs should know that politics is about taking the world as you find it, not as you would like it to be.And leadership is about taking decisions, even when all the choices are unpalatable.It is fine to stick to principle, but notthat means emulating King Canute’s stand against the waves.If Brexit does not happen it will be a ­national democratic calamity.As the party in power, the Conservatives will be punished.That means risking ­letting Jeremy Corbyn — a leader who can not even deal with anti-Semitism in his own party — seize control of the country.The stakes simply could not be higher. If this chance is squandered we will likely never get another moment.Right across Europe, critics of Brussels will think “even Britain couldn’t break free”.Henry Newman is director of the Open Europe think tank.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We needed the permission of the police to do that but you know, but quite frankly I didn’t care and neither did M. We just wanted to get on with it.Mr Peribanez adds: Patrick was a young kid at the time. We spent hours doing stake outs, surveillance. He was a quick learner.Mr Malinka confirmed he was followed, telling the documentary: My first experience of private surveillance was when I saw some cars in my rear view mirrors. I made a list of the number plates.Patrick says: We were trying to find out where he was going because it looked like he was trying to get somewhere in a rush.He has no regret for his actions, saying: I didn’t feel sorry for anybody. The little girl who had been abducted - that is the person I felt sorry for. Nobody .Mr Peribanez said at one point his boss told me to call him and offer him money to talk about the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.Confirming the approach was made, Mr Malinka reveals: In this sort of situation there are two types of people - one with power and one without. I didn’t have the power or the money.Mr Peribanez continues: I started with ,and I went to half a million, something like that. Malinka said don’t offer me money because I don’t know anything and I can’t give you anything.While Mr Malinka was wrongly dragged into the botched police inquiry someone firebombed his car when it was parked by his flat in Luz, and the Portuguese word FALA, which means talk, was sprayed on the pavement.There is no suggestion in the documentary M had anything to do with that crime but Mr Malinka recalls the incident, saying: This is the only time when it broke me, really hurt me. One missed phone call pretty much ruined ten years of my le.Mr Peribanez also admits: We put some trackers on Murat’s car and they found them. Sometimes you have to do things that are on the verge, on the border, no. Private investigations in Portugal are illegal. As a private investigator you are not to follow the book of rules.It gives you more freedom to investigate than being a cop.After extensive surveillance, the investigators found nothing to link Mr Murat or Mr Malinka to Maddie’s disappearance and Mr Peribanez tells the programme: They had nothing to do with it.Heart doctor Gerry, , and former GP Kate, , of Rothley, Leics refused to take part in the Netflix series The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann”.The pair believe it could hamper the nearly  year search to find their daughter, as well as fuel conspiracy theories regarding her disappearance.\" data-credit\"\" data-sizes\"auto\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   MADDIE-GRAPHIC-top.jpg stripallw\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" \" data-credit\"\" data-sizes\"auto\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   MADDIE-GRAPHIC-middle.jpg stripallw\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" \" data-credit\"\" data-sizes\"auto\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   MADDIE-GRAPHIC-bottom.jpg stripallw\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maybe to keep up levels of national happiness we should leave horrible, authoritarian bureaucracies every year. Just to put a grin on our faces. I mean, the French don’t seem very happy, do they But here’s the bad news. Theresa May is still Prime Minister and we’re currently heading for a Brexit which would be a travesty of the one we voted for in . If we get Brexit at all.Some of the Brexiteers in Parliament think we might still be able to escape the EU with a No Deal, on World Trade Organisation terms. I think they are deluding themselves.Parliament, which is two to one in favour of NOT leaving the EU, simply will not let it happen.And the EU, desperate to retain its market for goods in the UK, will make sure it doesn’t happen, too.Our Brexiteers are right that Theresa May’s deal is awful. Butthey get a chance to vote on it again, they should hold their noses and vote in favour.Because I reckon it’s that or nothing. We will have a delay, the EU may insist we hold a second referendum as a condition of that delay.And trust me, the second referendum will be rigged in favour of remaining in the EU. It will not be a straightforward in or out option. There will be three options, to split the Leave vote down the middle.In this fight to leave the EU, the British people have had everything against them. The EU, obvs. But also the House of Commons and the puffed-up, ludicrous, pro-Remain speaker John Bercow. And the House of Lords, the civil service and the BBC.The lesson for us low-born, powerless Leavers is to take what we can and scarper before the whole idea is killed stone dead. Which I fear it may be.And now Mrs May is heading back to Brussels to plead for a delay in triggering Article .All along she has been too obsessed with the process of leaving the EU, rather than the clear imperative as demanded by the British people — to simply LEAVE the EU, all of it.She has followed Brussels’ agenda at every twist and turn. And she’ll be following it now. She’ll do what the EU wants.So here’s the deal, as I see it. Give her hopeless proposal one more chance and this time vote for it.We will have been cheated, but not as badly aswe do not leave at all.Because the longer this goes on, the more likely that outcome will be.THIS country becomes more deranged by the very hour.A Roman Catholic journalist claims she may face JAIL because she referred to a transgendered person by the sex assigned at birth, rather than the one she now identies as.Caroline Farrow has been told she must attend a police station for a taped interview.She said: “I have pointed out to police that I am a Catholic journalist commentator and it is my religious belief that a person cannot change sex.”Quite.

I quickly came to learn that, in relation to Brexit, nothing could be further from the truth.Unfortunately, I must remain anonymous for fear of the backlash I would receive at my place of work.However, I can reveal I am a senior policy professional within the service and work closely with a number of government departments.There are a number of extremely dangerous myths regarding civil servants that I must dispel because of the impact they are having on the Brexit process.MYTH : The civil service is independent. The civil service was founded on the pillars of political neutrality.Civil servants are meant to ensure that their own political persuasions do not affect their work. Crucially, they should accept those from all political leanings and points of view.It has become clear to me that the vast majority of civil servants support Remain.From my observations I would estimate this number to be well over  per cent.This is worrying in itself and far from representative of the  per cent of the people who voted for Brexit.Most horrying, however, is the sheer disdain and utter contempt that my colleagues display towards people who voted to Leave.I have lost count of the number of insulting and derogatory terms that are used in my own department and where to refer to the .million people who voted for Brexit: “Racist”, “stupid”, “uneducated”.Anti-Brexit jokes and snide remarks are dropped casually into everyday office con-versations. I live in fear that my colleagues will discover through a slip of my tongue that I am a Brexiteer.Were this to happen, I believe that most would refuse to talk to me again and I might even lose my job.This entire culture creates a thickening cloud of negativity towards Brexit that shades all areas of the civil service. I have witnessed first-hand civil servants doing everything within their power, subtly and under the surface, to frustrate Brexit and talk it down at every opportunity.This can only seriously undermine our efforts to be in the strongest position possible on leaving the EU.MYTH : Civil servants are experts in their field.One would like to think the iniduals making decisions that affect our entire nation would have some level of skill or experience.If only that were true.For example, I know of one stand-alone “expert” policy team leading our preparations for Brexit.You can imagine my disbelief when I discovered none of its members had worked on anything remotely related to the EU before. In fact, I have discovered over time that the vast majority of “experts” within the service have no expertise whatsoever.In many cases the “portfolio” you take on when you join the service is dictated by the one held by your predecessor.As a result, you have new civil servants inheriting politically sensitive and highly important work without the faintest clue about what they are dealing with.Civil servants who are seriously underperforming will usually have a new job title and position created for them somewhere  in the organisation instead of being sacked or performance-managed — they become someone ’s problem then.Given the influence that civil servants are exerting over the Brexit process, this is truly concerning.MYTH : The civil service does not engage in scaremongering.I had hoped that civil servants, even in times of crisis, would be able to remain calm and level-headed in pursuit of ensuring the best outcomes for our country.And yet it is not uncommon for me to receive emails from colleagues promoting Brexit scare stories that are nothing more than lies and speculation. Recently, things have become so panicked that ious “Brexit contingency” plans have been set up throughout the organisation. This is to prepare for the “national public transport breakdown”, “surge in criminality” and “widespread public unrest” that is going to follow after we leave.These plans also involve collecting the personal details of certain civil servants to put in place a -hour, on-call rota for the “emergency” that is looming. This scare-mongering, created and whipped up by civil servants, is having a marked impact on the confidence and well-being of ordinary citizens.For example, one acquain-tance of mine is so terried by the speculative threats put out by the service they have started to stockpile large quantities of their medication. This needs to stop.MYTH : Ministers are in charge.When I was outside the civil service looking in, I always believed civil servants were there simply to advise their ministers, who, as elected representatives of the people, would make the ultimate decision. However, I have come to realise that ministers are often mere puppets, with civil servants pulling ferociously at their strings.The level of bureaucracy is unimaginable.In my experience parlia-mentary briefings go through — at a minimum — five stages of internal clearance, with crucial information being amended or deleted at every stage on the whim of that inidual civil servant.The power and competence of our ministers is, I’m afraid, a facade.They are nothing more than a megaphone for the views of biased civil servants who lurk behind them in the shadows.I am a supporter of the Leave campaign.To go against the will of the people expressed in the  referendum would be the ultimate act of betrayal.The Government MUST allow us to take back control by leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms. If the people are betrayed, I may have no choice but to resign.Honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity. We will soon discover, once and for all, whether our politicians embody these values.©The Sunday Times News Licensing Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Increasing fuel duty would be narrow minded and hit families and businesses right across the country.“Yet again it is clear that,the Labour party were in power, they would punish drivers and ignore the impact this would have for millions of people in the UK.”APD is levied on airline passengers aged  and over who are departing from UK airports.The rate for long-haul passengers is £ in economy and £ in premium seats, with short-haul trips charged at £ in economy and £ in premium.No duty is paid on direct long-haul flights from Northern Ireland.Motoring and aviation groups have called for duty on fuel and flights to be cut, but environmental campaigners say the levels should be increased.AA president Edmund King said motorists “support reasonable measures to improve air quality” but claimed a hike in fuel duty would be “seen as an attack on the economy”.He added: “We need to promote incentives for drivers to switch to greener vehicles rather than looking at measures to tax them more.”RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Tax, including VAT, already equates to around two-thirds of the price of a litre so raising fuel duty above its current level of almost p a litre would almost certainly have a very negative impact on the economy.Any move like this would hit those who can least afford it the hardest, particularlythey rely on their cars for getting to work.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Some Brits are also stung for previous over payments on the old system - many of whom are totally unaware that they owed money until its taken off their Universal Credit payment.A DWP spokeswoman said: When claimants have housing or utility arrears, we make deductions from their benefits to help pay off debts and keep them in their homes.Safeguards are in place to ensure that deductions are affordable.Earlier this week MPs revealed they will look into whether Brits are being forced into prostitution because of Universal Credit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477487236.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"baby born without nose birth defect","story":"The infant was delivered in Fallujah, Iraq, two weeks ago.Medics say the newborn has microcephaly - a condition where the head is smaller than normal, usually because the brain hasnt developed properly.It can be caused by a genetic abnormality, drug or alcohol abuse by the mother, or being exposed to a toxin or virus such as Zika during pregnancy.Images of the newborn were published by Fallujah Birth Defects, which has been documenting congenital malformation in the city, which was heavily bombed during the Iraq war.The organisation said it is the first time they have ever seen a case of microcephaly since setting up in .They said the child, whose gender hasnt been made public, comes from a family who live in a rural area and has three normal and healthy older siblings.Writing in comments on Facebook, the organisation said that the nose deformity was due to a cleft lip and palate and everything  in his body was considered normal.They added that the youngster was only able to breathe by gasping as the family had refused a tracheotomy, which is where a tube is inserted into the windpipe.In another similar case, an American toddler was born without a nose but died in  at the age of two.Eli Thompson had no nasal passages or sinus cavities - an extremely rare condition known as congenital arhinia - which only affects one in  million births.He had a tracheotomy to help him breathe at only five days old and was able to communicate through sign language.In , he got the chance to meet another child with the same condition - little Tessa Evans from Ireland who was two years old at the time.After the pair met, Tessas mum Grainne said: To get to introduce Tessa to Eli was like a dream come true and it meant the world to us to sit and talk with his family.Tessa was totally taken with Eli and hugged him and stroked his head.

I agree. It is now time for MPs to decide.”Her declaration came as EU chiefs laid down the gauntlet to MPs by insisting they will only grant Mrs May a short Brexit delay IF the Commons passes her deal next week.The ultimatum teed up the real chance of a clf edge No Deal Brexit on the originally scheduled March  exit in just eigtht days time.The PM ignited Westminster uproar yesterday by formally requesting a three month EU membership extension until June . But in a boost for the PM’s leverage on winning round diehard Brexiteers to back her deal, EU Council chief Donald Tusk also held up the prospect of a year-long delaythe agreement is voted down a third time next week.Addressing the nation live from No at .pm last night, Mrs May dubbed her three month delay “a matter of great personal regret for me”.But she added: “Of this I am absolutely sure: you the public have had enough. You are tired of the infighting. You are tired of the political games and arcane procedural rows.“Tired of MPs talking about nothing  but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children’s schools, our National Health Service, and kne crime.”Also on another day of extraordinary drama in Westminster yesterdayMrs May’s attack on rebel MPs triggered a backlash from many last night.Her former Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: “Democracy loses when a PM sets herself against the House of Commons then blames MPs for doing their job.”Mr Tusk, president of the European Council, said in Brussels this evening: A short extension will be possible but it will be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons.His comments raise the prospect of a do-or-die Commons showdown next week, with MPs forced to choose between swallowing the PMs deal - even after rejecting it twice - or quitting without any deal on March .Conservative MP Bob Seely said: Sounds like Deal or No Deal next week.Mr Tusk did not mention the possibility of a long extension - but he has previously spoken in favour of delaying Brexit by up to two years, suggesting the EU could still swoop in at the last minute to put Article  on ice for months to come.Tory Brexiteers will seize the opportunity to go for a No Deal outcome by rejecting the PMs deal again next week.Mark Francois told Sky News: If the EU dont give us an extension and her deal is voted down again, then we are free - that is what I am fighting for.But dozens of Remainer MPs could flock to Mrs Mays side in a bid to avoid what they see as the worst-case scenario.Any extension must be signed off by every one of the other  EU leaders at the European Council summit starting tomorrow, giving a veto to each country.French media reported that Emmanuel Macron is so sick of the ongoing drama that he will block a delay at the upcoming European Council summit.Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, suggested the request to delay could be rejected this week but then approved at an emergency EU summit next week.He told German radio: We will probably have to meet again next week, because Mrs May has not got agreement for anything either in her Cabinet or her Parliament. As long as we dont know what Great Britain will say yes to, we cant come to a resolution.The top Eurocrat added: If Great Britain does not leave at the end of March, then we are, I am sorry to say, in the hands of God. And I think even God sometimes reaches a limit to his patience.We are not in a state of war with the UK, but a state of negotiation. But the negotiations are finished.NO DEAL Brexit is now closer than ever.On the face of it, Donald Tusks statement means MPs will have to choose between approving Theresa Mays deal early next week, or crashing out with No Deal on March .Otherwise, Britain WONT get the three-month delay that the Commons voted for last week - which both the PM and Labour want to see.Brexiteers will use this as a chance to go for No Deal, which just a few days ago seemed almost impossible.But evenshe loses the support of Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers, the PM could still get her vote through by winning over Labour MPs.Even Jeremy Corbyn may drop his opposition to the deal rather than risk a No Deal outcome.However, some Remainers will cling on to the one option Mr Tusk failed to mention at all - a long extension lasting beyond the summer and potentially as long as two years.They still hope thatthe deal falls next week, Britain will end up staying in the EU permanently.But thats a high-stakes gamble - giving Parliament less than  hours to thrash out a months-long delay to Brexit which would then have to be signed off by  other EU leaders.It remains to be seen whether MPs are willing to risk it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We do believe we can construct a majority which will prevent the crashing out and all the chaos that will come from crashing out. That is what we’re absolutely focused on.    Mr Corbyn said we got a lot nearer last time than we did on previous occasions to getting Labouraposs version of a deal through. The Labour leader added: Our determination is to prevent a no-deal exit from the European Union next Friday. We are therefore looking for alternatives and building a majority in Parliament that can agree on a future constructive economic relationship with the European Union. Weaposve been discussing how this could come about and trying to reach out here as both Keirand myself have been reaching out to colleagues in all parties in the UK Parliament.  Accompanied by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, Mr Corbyn said: This morningaposs meetings have been positive and we have done what I believe the Government ought to be doing - instead of bringing back a twice-rejected deal to the British Parliament, looking for constructive solutions. Askedhe would put the country first and back the PMaposs deal he said: The PM’s deal has been flatly rejected twice by the British parliament. We do not believe it is a way forward and therefore we are looking for an alternative that can command a majority in Parliament.

The Prime Minister made a statement on Brexit where she slammed MPs for failing to pass her Withdrawal Agreement in time for Brexit at the end of next week. She blamed the House of Commons for failing to agree a means to implement the result of the  referendum and said she believes voters just want this stage of the Brexit process to be over. And she told voters: I am on your side. Mrs May said: Of this, I am absolutely sure: You the public have had enough. You are tired of the infighting, youaposre tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows, tired of MPs talking about nothing  but Brexit when you have real concerns about our childrenaposs schools, our National Health Service, kne crime.    You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side. It is now time for MPs to decide. But a lone voice was then heard to reply: Oh please as the embattled Prime Minister walked away from the lectern. A short extension of Brexit until the end of June is now considered likely followng a statement from the president of the European Council. Mr Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, told a press conference in Brussels: In the light of the consultations that I have conducted over the past days, I believe that a short extension would be possible.  But it would be conditional on a positive vote on the Withdrawal Agreement in the House of Commons. The question remains open as to the duration of such an extension. Mr Tusk indicated that it should be possible for leaders of the remaining EU  to approve his plan at a summit in the Belgian capital starting on Thursday. He said that while he did not foresee the need for another extraordinary summit next week, he would not hesitate to call onenecessary. If the leaders approve my recommendations and there is a positive vote in the House of Commons next week, we can finalise and formalise the decision on extension in the written procedure, he said. However,there is such a need, I will not hesitate to invite the members of the European Council for a meeting to Brussels next week.

The Foreign Secretary said revoking Article  - the legal countdown to Brexit - is among a limited list of outcomes MPs will find in Parliament to the current crisis. His bombshell comments came as more than , people signed a petition to revoke Article  in a single day. Under EU law the UK must get the approval of all  fellow leaders to delay Brexit - something Theresa May is asking for today. But European courts have ruled the UK can revoke the countdown to exit day on March  completely and unilaterally, without permission from Brussels.    Mr Hunt today said it was highly unlikely MPs would choose to revoke Article . The prospect is supported by some but opposed by both the Labour and Tory front benches - meaning the chances of it passing through Parliament next week would be slim to nil. However, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: If we are in the same situation this time next week then only a very limited list of things could happen. Parliament could vote to revoke Article , which is cancelling the Brexit process - I think thataposs highly unlikely. There could be an EU emergency summit to offer us an extension and we donapost know what thewill be and it could have some very onerous conditions - they could say, for example, aposWeaposll give you an extensionyou have a second referendumapos.    Again, I think itaposs very unlikely Parliament would vote for that. And then we have no-deal as the legal default on Friday. So the choice that we have now is one of resolving this issue or extreme unpredictability. Theresa May jets to Brussels this morning to request a delay to Brexit before putting her deal back to a vote by MPs on Tuesday. EU leaders are expected to grant her request for a three-month delay to June  at a summit in the Belgian capital. But it will be conditional on Mrs May getting her deal passed by Parliament next week - despite it failing by record numbers twice.  With all eyes on what happens next, the PM last night decided to turn her fire on MPs, accusing them of holding up Brexit. She told the public I am on your side, prompting fury from those who accused her of feeding a far-right rhetoric. Brexit Minister Kwasi Kwarteng today claimed: We have a good shot at actually landing the deal next week. But Lisa Nandy, a Labour MP whoaposd been preparing a compromise to back Mrs Mayaposs deal next week, said the PMaposs dangerous and reckless statement in Downing Street will have cost her support.

The Prime Ministeraposs threat to resign will grab the headlines but it should distract from the tact she was not just in denial about her predicament, the state of the Brexit crisis and the virtual collapse of her Government, she refused to take any responsibility for the chaos she has created. Jeremy Corbyn began by trying to take the role of the statesman, rather belatedly, in the absence of any leadership from the party on the other side of the Commons and invited the Prime Minister to meet him today to discuss the way forward. This lead to a rather tedious bout of point scoring over which leader had been most forthcoming in trying to reach a compromise. Mrs May then went through all the iations of Brexit the Commons had rejected - a second referendum, no deal and Corbyn’s plan - but failed to mention it had also twice voted down her own deal.    Corbyn then pressed her on how she would use any extension were one to be granted by the EU. The Prime Minister then said she had already answered that point in reply to a previous question. She hadn’t. This was an insulting answer to a reasonable question. The MPs and the public deserved better, not least because as the PM was speaking Downing Street released the letter to the EU setting out the reasons for the extension request. She was more willing to communicate her thinking on Twitter than to MPs. But Mrs May had not even got to the depths of the abasement to which she is capable of sinking.    She then lectured the Commons on its failure to deliver Brexit. “This House has indulged itself on Europe for too long,” she said. Perhaps the Prime Minister had forgotten that Brexit was inflicted on the country by her party  Perhaps she had wiped from her memory that she had repeatedly pulled votes, delaying the process still further  Perhaps she no longer believes that holding the Government to account is an essential aspect of any democracy  The session ended where it began with a Prime Minister refusing to accept there is no support for her deal and unwilling to countenance any other option. It is hard to think of something more indulgent.  Score: Jeremy Corbyn  Theresa May  ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\""},{"url":null,"title":"aaron campbell alesha macphail live","story":"NewsAaron Campbell sentencing: RECAP after Alesha MacPhails killer jailed for leAlesha MacPhail, six, was abducted, raped and murdered by twisted Aaron Campbell on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, last summerShareByAmber HicksUpdated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video alesha-asked-devastating-question-killer-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news aaron-campbell-alesha-macphail-live- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"The teenage boy who abducted, raped and murdered Alesha MacPhail is today starting his -year prison sentence.

Merely stating that fact is horric enough but the circumstances surrounding these vile crimes and manner of their commission has quite rightly aroused revolution and disbelief that these sorts of things could happen. Alesha had just arrived on Bute to spend the holiday with her father and grandparents and had gone to bed apparently safe in her own room. No doubt she was looking forward to what the next few weeks had in store.Her father and his parents would have enjoyed every minute of it. While her mother and her family would have been counting down the days until they saw her smiling face again.Meanwhile, you attended a party at your own home, consumed alcohol and then on your account - to which I will- went off in search of cannabis.You went into the house and then her bedroom.You removed her from there and took her to a secluded spot where you violated and murdered her in the most brutal fashion.The details of that were revealed in the evidence and I do not intend to go over them again.It is dficult to imagine the distress which her family must have suffered not only when she went missing but when the awful news came in that she had been found dead.That distress can only have been intensied,that was possible, by their finding out of the extent of what you did to her not only in the months and weeks immediately afterwards, but in the course of the trial.I have read statements by her parents and grandparents in which they have tried to express their loss and the emptiness that greets them every day.Lord Matthews Just as I know no sentence which I can pass will alleviate their anguish, so I know that mere words are pure deflections of it.The affect on the island community was profound. Many of them rallied round to help in the search and the affect for those who saw Alesha in the woods will be long lasting.I have never before seen a police officer almost break down in the witness box so affected by the sight.The contrast between them and you could not be more vivid.Your attitude was clearly demonstrated by the evidence that you posted an image of yourself in the mirror while making a joke that you had found where the murderer was hiding. The arrogance and callousness of that is breathtaking. Thanks to the dedication of the police and forensic scientists, ably assisted by members of the public, such as those who came forward when they found articles of your clothing lying on the shore, you were eventually brought to justice.Despite the overwhelming evidence against you, you did not plead guilty but elected to go to trial. That is your right and I do not increase your sentence because of it. However it is symptomatic of your staggering lack of remorse.Not once during the trial did I detect a flicker of emotion from you. That was also the experience of the professionals who interviewed you for the purposes of the reports, to which I willshortly.Your defence was one of incrimination of a young woman, Toni Louise McLachlan, and you gave evidence in support of it.It was a cruel travesty of the truth which was understandably reported widely in the media and left her open to suspicion at the very least and quite possibly hatred. All of which was due to your perverted imagination. I am very grateful it was made clear she was completely innocent. I was shocked when I saw the contents of the social criminal justice report and the report from the doctor. They contain clear admissions by you of your guilt. Not only that - and this is a terrible thing to say of someone so young - but they paint a clear picture of a cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous inidual. I think it right that the public, and more particularly her family, be given some flavour of the contents. Doctor McPherson noted that you presented your account in a matter-of-fact manner, notably for the absence of any emotions. He recorded that you told him in the  months prior to the murder you entertained thoughts of doing something excessive, including rape.Your account in brief was that you had been drinking but wanted cannabis and decided to break into the house to get some.

I will not go into the horric and cold-blooded details of what you said you did to her, but you explained that after you murdered Alesha you threw your blood-stained clothing into the sea, had a shower and then went back to where you left her to retrieve your phone. Doctor McPherson reports that you told him over the next few days you were totally unconcerned, other than to be mildly amused that the police had not arrested you. Two other aspects of his report are worth mentioning. The first is that you told him in points during the trial it took everything to stop laughing and you had to zip your mouth. The second is that you volunteered that you were quite satisfied with the murder.According to all of the reports you are not suffering from any mental health disorder and indeed you are not suffering from any syndrome or disorder of any kind. On the other hand you are completely lacking in victim empathy. The social worker noted your cold, calculating manner. The only sentence I can impose of you is detention without limit of time.

Her heartbroken parents Adam and Caroline say they are lost without their lovely, gentle and special daughter Chloe. She died suddenly after she turned blue and her heart stopped beating, HullLive reported. Chloe was rushed to hospital by paramedics but died despite the desperate efforts to save her. Her family - from South Cave in East Riding of Yorkshire - have been told she had suffered a fatal heart attack and her death will be investigated by the coroner. The leaves behind twin sister Charlotte, older brother William, , as well as her heartbroken parents. Caroline Hardy, , of South Cave, said: I am heartbroken at the loss of my beautul girl. Chloe was so special to us and will be greatly missed. I have a huge gap in my heart but she will never be forgotten. There are no words to express the sadness we feel.    Husband Adam, , said he does not know how the family will cope with her death. He said: Our whole family are in terrible shock after our beautul daughter died suddenly. We are devastated. Chloe has a twin sister, Charlotte, they are non-identical twins and were completely opposite, both in appearance and personality - but they were undoubtedly best friends. Chloe was the more shy, softer, gentler one. She liked singing and would break into spontaneous song for no reason, she also liked dancing. Charlotte gravitated towards unicorns and princesses, but Chloe loved superman, spiderman, digging and painting - anything that was mucky.    She also loved water play - we struggled to get her out the bath. She never bothered with dolls. Chloe had come on in leaps and bounds over the past year, the couple said She had grown into a loving, caring girl, with an endearing random streak. Mr Hardy said: Chloe was a bit behind when she was younger, it took her until she was two to walk. It was a bit like having a child who was a year younger than she was. She didnapost come for cuddles and would enjoy playing on her own, but over the past year she has come on so much and changed so much and became so loving. She used to do random things like throw a slipper out of her bedroom door in the middle of the night because it wasnapost hers. Itaposs dficult to cope with how quiet the house is, itaposs only been a week and Iaposm missing the chaos Chloe caused - we liked that chaos and you donapost realise how you will miss it until itaposs gone.    Tragically, Chloeaposs parents do not think her twin sister fully understands that her twin sister is not gone. Mr Hardy said: I don’t think Charlotte really understands it. I don’t think she comprehends where her best friend has gone. She maybe thinks she has gone somewhere without her. Her brother is seven and he understands it more and has taken a bit of comfort in thinking she is in heaven which he has learned about at school. The couple are putting a brave face on their heartache for the sake of their other children, and have also thanked their family and friends for their support. Mr Hardy said: I don’t know how we will cope. Once the children are in bed and we are left on our own at night you are left looking at the wall. We are having to put a brave face on it, thereaposs not other option. What do you do when you’ve got two others  If we just had the one child we would be sat in a room balling our eyes out, but the priority is how the other two deal with it.  What we and my we feel is secondary, of course we are devastated, but the main concern has to be trying to look after the other two. I think we are still in shock, itaposs not sunk in yet. The actual incident which was so unexpected and horrying. The little girlaposs entire family were at home when she passed away Wednesday, March . Mr Hardy said: Chloe had had a little bit of a cold, my we was giving her some medicine, she didnapost want it so she got up from her chair she ran off to her bedroom. My we followed her, and straight away she was turning blue. Her heart stopped beating and she was instantly gone. She wasn’t choking or anything like that, she wasnapost struggling for breath, it was instant. After ringing  less than a minuteaposs drive from their house and was given emergency treatment almost immediately. He said: She got there in less than a minute and in less than three minutes Chloe was receiving CPR by a doctor.  The GPs were really good, they were straight out to help her, but nothing they could have done would have brought her back, at no point did she come back at all. We could have waited for an ambulance but we didnapost want to wait ten minutes, amazingly my we kept a level head and got her to the surgery. Paramedics tried vainly to save Chloe in the ambulance on the way to Hull Royal Infirmary, but there was nothing they could do to save her. The community in South Cave have launched a Just Giving page to support the family and to help pay for her funeral costs. Click here to donate. Mrs Hardy added: We are so grateful for all the love and support we have received from family and friends and the wider community.

Twice-orced Ade Goodchild, , said he had no plans to settle down but warned potential gold diggers he is no soft touch. The former metal factory worker said: “Anybody who I think I couldn’t have pulled before has got no chance, because I haven’t suddenly become more attractive overnight – just my wallet has. “I do like tall redheads, mind.” Ade sounded like football legend George Best as he joked while quaffing champagne: “I’ll spend my money on wine and women – and waste the rest.” But after two failed marriages he insisted “love would have to come find me”.    Cousin Michelle Lintern, , of Caerphilly, said the relatives would happily help only child Ade avoid gold diggers. She said: “He’s a bit vulnerable with all that money but we are all very protective of him. We are all about the same age and very close.” Ade’s first we Catherine Berkeley said she wished him well and did not want a penny of his winnings. She told the Mirror: “I could not be more pleased, it could not have happened to a nicer man.” She said they met in the pubs of Hereford when she was just  and married in , before orcing in . She added: “We were so young when we got together – it feels like a dferent letime.” Ade said he orced from his second we Susannah only two years ago. The pair, who were married for  years, have stayed friends and she still walks his labradoodles Taz and Mutley. He said: “I called to say I’d won £million on the lottery but she didn’t believe me, she knows I’m a leg puller. We are still in touch, there’s no bitterness.”    But he declined to reveal whether his ex would get a cut of his winnings although close pals revealed it is more than likely he will share some of his fortune with her. However Susannah’s parents, Malcolm and Lesley Smith, said she had told them: “I don’t want a penny of his winnings. He can keep the lot.” Mrs Smith, , reportedly said Susannah now works -hour days doing two jobs. She said: “Poor Susannah had been unhappy for years. She said he’d let himself go, become very self-centred. She put up with it for as long as she could but she’d had enough. “He wouldn’t do anything around the house or garden, or even walk their two labradoodle dogs. Even after they split up, she had to go back to the house every day to walk them.” Sports-mad Ade, whose family is originally from South Wales, revealed he celebrated finding out about his win on Saturday by watching Wales win the rugby union Grand Slam with his dad.    He said: “We had slightly fancier beer, nice Italian beer, sent out for pizza and had some spicy wings – the sort of things millionaires do every Saturday.” He now wants a new house with a jacuzzi, “a few staff” and dream holidays to places such as the Grand Canyon and the Pyramids. He said: “I’m not a gardener but I’d like a bit of space for the dogs and a nice spot for my hammock on sunny days, so it would be good to have someone to take care of the view for me. I think I could also get used to a driver and even my own cook.” Ade bought the winning ticket at a Co-op in Hereford, where staff said he was a “genuinely nice, lovely guy”.    He went public about the jackpot at a four-star hotel in Great Malvern, Worcs, today. He said: “I’m not one of these winners who is going to say this win won’t change me. “It b****y well will, or at least I’ll give it a damn good go.” Ade revealed that his first priority is to go looking at new houses with his parents. He said: “Like all parents, they worry about my mortgage, bills and how long I will have to work for. I’ve told my parents they can stop saving now and spend my inheritance.” Ade said he plans to help his extended family financially too, after having to keep the win a secret from them at a pub family gathering in Abergavenny on Sunday. He said: “I didn’t want to spoil our day. Most of them know now though. I am going to enjoy sitting down and chatting about how I might be able to help them.” Ade admitted he was not perfect, but said: “What man of my age hasn’t made mistakes  “I have regrets but I hope I haven’t hurt or upset anyone.” He added: “I’m certainly not a stupid man, but I have done stupid things, I think now I have learned from them and just put them all behind me.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"home office quotes violent bible","story":"NewsHome Office quotes violent Bible verses to reject Christians asylum claimIn a letter refusing an Iranian convert asylum in the UK, a Home Office official said Holy texts are filled with death and violenceShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsThe letter from the Home Office quotes examples of violent passages in the Bible \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Christian convert has been told his Holy texts are filled with death and violence in an unbelievably offensive Home Office ruling saying he mustto Iran. An immigration caseworker has shared the diatribe - which quotes bloodthirsty passages from the Bible - saying he was genuinely shocked by what he read. The Iranian man, who has not been named, applied for asylum in , but this has been refused. Human rights groups claim that Christian converts in Iran face persecution, with hundreds targeted and arrested because of their faith by the Islamic Republic.    The asylum seeker - who is set to appeal the Home Office decision - had claimed Christianity was a religion of peace. However in a response letter, a Home Office quoted five violent passages from the Bible, including sections from the Book of Leviticus and the Book of Revelations. It then says: These examples are inconsistent with your claim that you converted to Christianity after discovering it is a apospeacefulapos religion, as opposed to Islam which contains rage and revenge.Caseworker Nathan Stevens wrote on Twitter : I’ve seen a lot over the years, but even I was genuinely shocked to read this unbelievably offensive diatribe being used to justy a refusal of asylum.   He continued: Whatever your views on faith, how can a government official arbitrarily pick bits out of a holy book and then use them to trash someone’s heartfelt reason for coming to a personal decision to follow another faith  Giving examples of violence in the Bible, the Home Office letter describes the Book of Revelation as filled with imagery of revenge, destruction, death and violence. In his application for asylum, the Iranian man had written: In Islam there is violence, rage and revenge. In Christianity in the contrary it is talking about peace, forgiveness and kindness. In December, Thereports , more than  converts were arrested in December and accused of proselytising - trying to make others join the faith.Zoe Smith, head of advocacy at Open Doors - which monitors persecution of Christians, said at the time: “This spike in arrests is highly concerning. “It follows an established trend of the Iranian government – as the number of converts to Christianity increase, so the authorities place greater restrictions on churches.Legal expert Conor James McKinney, from website Free Movement, told The Independent : You can see from the text of the letter that the writer is trying to pick holes in the asylum seeker’s account of their conversion to Christianity and using the Bible verses as a tool to do that.“The Home Office is notorious for coming up with any reason they can to refuse asylum and this looks like a particularly creative example, but not necessarily a systemic outbreak of anti-Christian sentiment in the department.” A spokesman from the Home Office said: This letter is not in accordance with our policy approach to claims based on religious persecution, including conversions to a particular faith. We continue to work closely with key partners, including the APPG on International Freedom of Religion and a range of faith groups, to improve our policy guidance and training provided to asylum decision-makers so that we approach claims involving religious conversion in the appropriate way.

Alesha was on the Isle of Bute to visit her dad and grandparents when she was snatched from her bed, raped and murdered on July  last year. The killer was today jailed for at least  years. But why did Aaron Campbell brutalise the innocent six-year-old in such a chilling and vicious attack  What drove him to take Alesha from her bed, take her to an abandoned hotel and inflict  injuries upon her  The teenager was described as popular by his mother, and had a girlfriend who stood by him during the trial. Today he finally confessed to those crimes and said he had to stop himself from laughing during the murder trial. When Campbell was found guilty at Glasgow High Court last month, the judge, Lord Matthews, said he had committed “some of the wickedest, most evil crimes this court has ever heard in its long history of dealing with depravity”.  He added: “I have no idea why you did this. I do know that the evidence against you was overwhelming.” Many questioned how a schoolboy could carry out such an evil attack that left Aleshaaposs family and wider community distraught. Professor Elizabeth Yardley, a Professor of Criminology and Director of the Centre for Applied Criminology at Birmingham City University, says this was not a random incident where Campbell snapped. Speaking to , she said Aleshaaposs murder was one of the most awful cases Iaposve come across. If you look at the extent of violence that was used, she had  injuries, this was not the case of a normal, healthy inidual one day turned into a homicidal child-killer the next, she explains. This is somebody who would have had an extensive history of problematic behaviour. This is someone who really values violence and enjoys hurting other people. I think one of the most disturbing things to me was how calm he was afterwards.    CCTV footage shows Campbell going in and out of his house on a number of occasions throughout the night that Alesha was kidnapped and killed. His mother alerted the police to the footage thinking it would eliminate him from their enquiries. but instead it alerted them to the killer. Prof Yardley adds: Youaposve got this CCTV of him just sauntering home so he doesnapost appear to have an emotional reaction to it. He appears to be emotionally empty and heaposs got this lack of remorse. Most of the offenders I work with whoaposve been convicted of manslaughter and murder canapostat all because theyaposre so abhorred by the harm theyaposve caused. They canapost behave in a normal way at all, and so for Campbell to react in that way suggests some psychopathic tendencies to me. Another key thing that comes through for me is that Alesha was a girl. Thataposs a really signicant thing here and that the attack involved sexual violence - that tells us about his views about women and girls, who they are and how they should behave. Itaposs inherently misogynistic. One of the most common things we see in cases of femicide is strangulation and thataposs what weaposve got here. A post-mortem found Alesha died of pressure to the face and neck.  After Campbell was found guilty and Lord Matthews lted the anonymity order, it emerged that Campbell had a fascination with the Slenderman character and violent video games. Prof Yardley argues that the gruesome character would not have compelled him to carry out the awful attack. Instead, she says he would have been drawn to Slenderman because it reinforced his views. I always say these things cause people to commit these acts of violence, people are watching this kind of stuff but they support the views and values that they already have, she explains. It isnapost something that triggers this kind of thing. Describing Campbell as evil isnapost something Ms Yardley agrees with and says heaposs a person who decided to do an evil thing. Given how sustained the attack was and the number of injuries that she had - thataposs  decisions to keep inflicting harm on somebody. This is someone who knows exactly what theyaposre doing, they know what theyaposre doing is wrong and they just choose to do it anyway.  Ms Yardley has worked with countless offenders and says this level of violence is usually something they take years to work up to. For somebody who is a teenager to be doing this kind of thing is really rare, thankfully, but when it does happen, itaposs horrendous. Campbell is also alleged to have nearly drowned a dferent young girl at a leisure centre pool years before Aleshaaposs murder. He was just six or seven when he held the youngsteraposs head under the water for so long she feared she would drown, Bute locals claimed. And the killer is said to have slaughtered and skinned cats in his younger teens, apparently burying two feline corpses in his garden. One neighbour also claimed Campbell had become a local nuisance on Bute and was once caught trying to set fire to buildings.  None of the stories, including the aposnear-drowningapos, have been corroborated, but they have been making the rounds on the island. Iaposd argue that people donapost just snap, thataposs not a thing, Ms Yardley says. In order to perpetrate something this horrendously violent, you need to value violence and that comes from a messy combination of nature and nurture. Iaposd say itaposs what they observe in the world around them growing up is quite an important factor in leading to this kind of thing. All the violent men I work with have some kind of horrendous abuse, or neglect, or trauma in their early lives. They feel that during their time as children, they didnapost have a lot of control and that develops into an intense need to be in control as adolescents and adults. And for some people that can mean harming other people. This is a young man who wants to call all the shots, he wants everything his way.  The murder trial heard about Campbellaposs other social media activity after Alesha was murdered, including a Snapchat video in which Campbell looked into a mirror and said: “Found the guy who’s done it. The court also heard how he had spoken to a friend about killing someone for the le experience. Prof Yarldey argues that Campbell will have loved the attention after the anonymity order was lted and will embrace his new-found notoriety. Thereaposs quite a sense of narcissism about him that heaposs enjoying the attention, she says. When the anonymity order was lted I thought, aposheaposs going to be quite liking thisapos. Itaposs Aleshaaposs name we should be remembering from this case and not his. Heaposs going to enjoy people talking about him, having his name and picture out there in the papers and heaposll really enjoy the fact that people are trying to figure out what drove him to do this. But heaposs not going to have an easy time in prison at all...child killers are right at the bottom of the pecking order. Heaposs going to have one eye open all of the time.  Prof Yardley also believes Campbell would have killed againhe had not be apprehended for Aleshaaposs murder. When you look at the level of harm heaposs inflicted and the fact that he enjoy doing that, I think the only thing that saved potential future victims is that heaposs a very inexperienced offender. He was incredibly disorganised, he wasnapost forensically aware enough to try and cover his tracks. This was someone who was capable of more harm and he still is now. However, she does believe Campbell can be rehabilitated -he accepts responsibility for the harm he has caused. Thataposs one of the things I always say about serious violent offenders is everybody is capable of change. Iaposve seen examples of that happen but in order for somebody to change their behaviour, they need to acknowledge that what theyaposve done and accept responsibility for it, she says. Iaposve worked with people convicted of murder, manslaughter, armed robbery and during their time in prison they have decided aposI donapost want to be this person anymoreapos. And it can take years and years and years but they have got there in the end. There are scant details about how Campbell managed to take Alesha from her grandparentsapos house without anyone waking up and Ms Yardley believes he would have planned the attack.  I think this was probably something he had been fantasising about for some time. I think this was going to happen and there would have been warning signs. Professor Yardley also says thereaposs no evidence Campbell had mental health issues and discounts the theory that drugs and alcohol would have played a part in his decision to kill. Itaposs so disturbing to think that someone of that age can consciously decide to cause that amount of harm but thataposs what weaposve got in this case and we really need to understand where that came from in order to prevent this happening again. He certainly wasnapost an innocent little boy one minutes and then played a violent video game and turned into a killer.

Dad-of-one Mr Bagley, from Southsea in Portsmouth, had purchased the Lucky Dip while buying a birthday gt, and before checking it told friends he was too skint to join them at the pub.When the -year-old checked his numbers on the National Lottery app, a bell chimed and he thought the screen said heaposd won £,, but the prize had a few extra zeroes.   Mr Bagleyaposs Lucky Dip had matched all six numbers. He bought the ticket at the Tesco Express on Palmerston Road in Southsea while buying a birthday present for his stepdad. On Sunday morning, he decided he couldnapost afford to join his friends at the pub to watch the football. Mr Bagley said: “I was feeling a bit skint so was readying myself for a quiet day. I turned on the radio and heard an ad for the Lotto, which reminded me to check my ticket.    I used The National Lottery app on my phone and when the bell chimed, and I looked at the screen, I was sure I’d won £,.” He called his stepdad to deliver the news. Mr Bagley said: “I told my stepdad my news and started to think maybe a couple of Sunday pints and some football might be in order. Then he said that there was a single £.million jackpot winner and was I sure the win didn’t have a few more zeroes.  I looked again and realised my very exciting £, was actually £.million. The dad, who has a daughter, has handed in his notice and plans to use the money to take care of his family and treat himself to a holiday and a new car. He said of his win: “It was an unbelievable feeling. I rang my brother and some of my closest mates to tell them the news before popping around to mumaposs. Being able to have a drink with my mum and tell her that she never had to worry about money ever again was magic, and really beats any other grand plan I might have.”  He added: “Without doubt the best bit about this win will be helping out friends and family. We’re all going to have a great time and some really good stuff will come from this win because I can help those who really matter to me. Whether it’s helping with a holiday or setting up my daughter for le, the worries have gone and the financial security is now there.” Mr Bagley also plans to take care of himself, saying heaposll buy a dream car - a Range Rover or,his brother has his way, an Aston Martin.

Instead, she delivered a dishonest statement that blamed everyone but herself for the crisis. The Prime Minister took the dangerous and unworthy step of trying to pitch herself on the side of the people against Parliament. She claimed that MPs were thwarting Brexit by refusing to make a decision but failed to mention she has repeatedly blocked calls for the Commons to hold a series of indicative votes so they could find a way forward.    She said voters were tired of the endless hold-ups, without admitting her dithering and inaction were the main cause of the delays. An issue that should have been resolved weeks ago now rests on MPs having to make a decision against the tyranny of the clock. The Mirror set out a sensible alternative for Brexit based on a Norway-style deal which could command a majority in the Commons. Rather than test support for such an option, the PM has led the country to this clf edge by blindly pursuing a deal already rejected twice. It is a damning indictment of Mrs May’s handling of Brexit that with eight days before we could leave the EU, the world’s fth biggest economy still has no idea what its trading relationship will be with its largest market. A PM who put her country in such a position should have resigned. She and she alone is responsible for this national humiliation.    Sick slaughter If you want a definition of cowardice, it is a trophy hunter who uses a high-powered rle to shoot a sleeping animal.

The events planner from Birmingham ended up being prescribed steroid cream to use twice a day, and was later given antihistamines as she was losing sleep due to her scratching. Iaposve had eczema since I was little, but itaposs always been manageable with flare ups mostly in winter, said Laurie. The furthest back I can remember is when I was about eight years old and I just had it in the creases of my arms and legs.    I now have small scars all over my body from where Iaposve scratched, and the cut has been so deep and was scratched so many times in the same spot that Iaposve scarred my skin.After not seeing much improvement by the end of last summer, the -year-old started researching topical steroid withdrawalafter spotting people on Instagram warning others of the dangers of what she was applying.In January  Laurie stopped using all steroids and creams in favour of treating her skin naturally. The withdrawal caused Laurieaposs skin to become broken and flaky, leading her to cancel social engagements out of fear of people seeing her skin. Iaposve stripped everything back to basics and Iaposve been vegan since the new year, I have oat baths every two days and no longer slather my body with moisturiser, she continued.    I am also taking daily vitamins, D, zinc, selenium and acidophilus and drinking lots of juice. I actively avoid taking any paracetamol, which seems drastic, but Iaposd rather find the underlying cause of my problems and treat it myself rather than masking the symptoms. My sleep was disrupted every night without doubt as Iaposd wake up and scratch for about  minutes, five times a night. I have never been a sweater, but I am sweating like mad through the night because of TSW. When I first came off steroids, I couldnapost get warm. Iaposd sit at work with a cup of tea, my coat on all day and a heater by me and Iaposd still be cold and shivering. My skin was so broken, so it wasnapost retaining heat. Iaposd also feel weak and my legs would shake.    People double take when they see me now, but thataposs only natural, and some ask me whataposs happened to my face and skin. I was a lot more self-conscious at the beginning than I am now, partly because my face is better and partly because Iaposm so used to looking the way I do.

For years scholars have debated whether Greek historian Herodotus was right when he described seeing unusual boats on the Nile after a visit to the country. Herodotus had dedicated  lines of his Historia text describing the construction of a baris. And the discovery of the sunken ship shows just how accurate the historian was. Dr Damian Robinson, director of Oxford University’s centre for maritime archaeology, said: It wasn’t until we discovered this wreck that we realised Herodotus was right.    “What Herodotus described was what we were looking at.” Dr Robinson said that previous scholars had “made some mistakes” in struggling to interpret the text without archaeological evidence. “It’s one of those enigmatic pieces. Scholars have argued exactly what it means for as long as we’ve been thinking of boats in this scholarly way.    The excavation of what has been called Ship  has revealed a vast crescent-shaped hull and a previously undocumented type of construction involving thick planks assembled with tenons – just as Herodotus observed. Dr Robinson, whose centre is publishing the findings, added: “Herodotus describes the boats as having long internal ribs. Nobody really knew what that meant… that structure’s never been seen archaeologically before. Then we discovered this form of construction on this particular boat and it absolutely is what Herodotus has been saying.”    About  per cent of the hull has been well preserved in the Nileaposs silts.According to theAlexander Belov, whose book on the wreck,  Ship : a Baris from Thonis-Heracleion , is published this month, suggests that the wreck’s nautical architecture is so close to Herodotus’s description it could have been made in the very shipyard that he visited.Word-by-word analysis of his text demonstrates that almost every detail corresponds “exactly to the evidence”.

I thought that was too much time added on but, having said that, it’s not the reason,” he said.“We had a great opportunity on the counter attack with two minutes to go and we’ve got to be better.“That’s the reason we are where we are because we’ve been going into so many good areas in each of the last few games and we’re not punishing teams.“We didn’t do what Celtic did. They were ruthless and that’s why we’ve not picked up enough points since I’ve come.“There has been plenty of positive play, plenty of areas we’ve got into but we need to be better in the final third.“It’s the only thing that’s going to get you out of the situation that you’re in – winning games.”Returning to Madden’s decision to play on for so long, Jim confirmed he had spoken to the referee to get his reasoning.“He said there were a couple of head knocks, so that was the reason why. It’s generally about three but there were a couple of knocks, so I could understand maybe four. Six was a surprise.”The defeat, along with Hamilton Accies’ surprise win over Hearts on Saturday, means Dundee are now six points from safety down in the top flight drop zone.The postponement of St Mirren’s game at St Johnstone on Saturday because of snow means the Dark Blues remain a point above bottom."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee supporters society rejects bid from club owner to buy groups shares","story":"Dundee’s main supporters group have knocked back the latest offer from the club’s American owner to buy shares from them and increase his stake at Dens Park to over %.But while they’re unwilling to sell any of their shares, the Dundee FC Supporters’ Society have repeated support for plans to move to a new stadium near the city’s Camperdown Park.In January, Texas-based Tim Keyes, through majority shareholders in the Dark Blues Football Partners Scotland which he owns, had a move to buy the society’s ‘A’ Ordinary shares refused.They’re the shares that hold the power of veto over such matters as any sale of the club, a move from Dens and even substantial borrowing.Earlier this month Keyes then made an offer for the society’s Ordinary shares, a move that would give him .% of Dundee shares and the club said would allow them to claim Group Tax Relief to offset losses.After discussions with the club and their own membership, however, the society’s board have decided that’s a non-starter as well.In an alternative proposal, the club had asked the society to “agree to support resolutions which increase the club’s share capital and then allot shares specically to FPS”.That, too, however, has been rejected. The society board have now informed Dens financial director David Gray and their own members of the decision to hang on to all their shares.Given there’s no provision in society rules for the sale of any shares and their rejection of the original attempt to get their veto-holding shares, this latest move comes as no surprise, particularly as even an improved offer of £, for the ordinary shares was viewed as derisory by many members.Dundee are now likely to undertake a full share issue that would allow Keyes to break through the % barrier but is likely to entail administrative costs running into five figures."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united confirm departure of laurie ellis","story":"Dundee United have confirmed former assistant boss Laurie Ellis’ departure from Tannadice.As the Tele

fans after the late call-off of Saturday’s Championship clash with Dundee United.United were already at East End Park and most of their travelling support were close to completing their journey when the game was called off just  minutes before kick-off.That was despite the Pars insisting from first thing in the morning that, despite heavy snow and torrential rain, the pitch would be fine.When, however, match referee David Lowe inspected the pitch at around .pm it took him no more than a couple of minutes to give the snow-covered surface the thumbs down because it was waterlogged.That saw the United squad get straight back on the team bus and depart within minutes.The news was too late for some fans of both clubs and they arrived at the stadium to find there was to be no game.Other than confirm the game was off, referee Lowe declined to comment further.And, initially, the home club also refused to provide an explanation.Later, however, they did make a statement via their official website.“Following the cancellation of this afternoon’s match against Dundee United, DAFC would like to apologise to all home and away supporters who have been inconvenienced by the call off at .pm,” it read.“Our ground staff and officials have been in since . this morning and we have been in dialogue with the SPFL since then.“The weather conditions proved extremely dficult to predict

pressure on top dogs ross county","story":"Theof winter weather last weekend, and the raft of postponements it led to, has given Dundee United the chance to put some pressure on leaders Ross County when the Championship’s top two clash at Tannadice tonight.First to fall foul of the conditions was County’s Highland derby trip to Inverness Caley Thistle on Friday evening, that one going off because of a waterlogged pitch.Had it gone ahead, it would have provided the Staggies with the opportunity to stretch their advantage over United in the race for automatic promotion to a massive  points.Their own scheduled action at Dunfermline on Saturday afternoon had to be called off after heavy snow and rain left the East End Park playing surface saturated.United had already arrived at the ground and most of their travelling support were not that far away when the call-off was confirmed just  minutes from kick-off.That made it a frustrating afternoon, particularly as it was clear the pitch was in no fit state for a game to be played.But it still means the Tangerines can cut the deficit to their main rivals to eight pointsthey can beat them.With another clash between the pair to come in the Highlands early next month, a victory would leave boss Robbie Neilson still believing his side can finish in top spot in the second tier.To do that United will have to find the form that’s deserted them in recent outings. They’ve managed just one win in four games.And as well as a dip in performance over that period, United have struggled to find the back of the net from open play.In the last five games, only Cammy Smith’s close-range opener in the draw at Falkirk was not from a set-piece and the four other efforts to hit the mark have all been from the boot of Nicky Clark, either from the penalty spot or free-kicks.The effort to improve on that will not be helped by the absence of main striker Pavol Safranko tonight and again when Alloa visit on Saturday, because he is now away on international duty with Slovakia.The other experienced No  in the squad, Osman Sow, would not have been fit for the weekend after aggravating a troublesome calf problem early on in the last outing down at Partick Thistle.Sow was being checked in training yesterday but the chances are he will not make tonight and will even be a major doubt for this weekend.That being the case, Robbie has a big call to make when it comes to how he sets up his attack for the next couple of outings.He does at least have Peter Pawlett back available after the one-game suspension he picked up for his red card in the league win over Inverness. Theof the former Aberdeen man could see Clark pushed right up top and him used in a supporting role.Another option would be to use Matty Smith as the main striker but given the young attacker has not started since the Tannadice win over Dunfermline back on January , that would be a big ask.Whatever way he decides to go, tonight and in the coming games, the boss will be looking for both more chances to be created and a much better conversation rate.That will be a challenge against a County team that have hit league-winning form since mid-January.Their only defeat in  games in all competitions was when they went down to Inverness on penalties in a Scottish Cup replay."},{"url":null,"title":"wanted paul mcmullan is poised to pen new dundee united deal","story":"The feeling of being wanted again has persuaded attacker Paul McMullan to pledge his future to Dundee United – just seven months after he was all but shown the door.After the -year-old turned in a Man-of-the-Match performance in Tuesday’s massive - win over Championship leaders Ross County, boss Robbie Neilson said following recent talks, he’s now offered the former Scotland U  kid a new contract.And McMullan’s revealed the faith his gaffer has shown in him since taking over from Csaba Laszlo in October means he’s very close to agreeing terms.That represents a remarkable change in fortune, having been told just before the end of the August transfer window he was free to find another club.“I’m not far away, it’s just the final wee bit and, hopefully, we get it done sooner rather than later,” he said.“For one reason or another, the previous manager wasn’t having me but the gaffer’s come in and made it clear to me I’m part of his plans.“That gives you a boost and, like I did the other night, you want to give everything any time he gives you a chance.“Saying that, for me, it doesn’t matter what situation you find yourself in, you don’t stop working and I’ve always done my best when I’ve been picked. Any time you get a chance to play you have to give everything.“But there is nothing better as a player than somebody who treats you well and is talking to you all the time.“I’ve, obviously, experienced the other side of it when you are quite clearly not wanted, so when you are, you feel  times better for it.”He repaid the faith shown in him by Robbie by playing a major part on Tuesday and now he’s aiming to help United get even closer to County.“It’s eight points, still a big gap but we play twice before they play again, so it’s on us. We can put a bit of pressure on them and all we can do is go and win our games and see how they react.“Obviously, it’s still in Ross County’s hands and,they win all their games there’s nothing we can do, but we have to make sure we are winning.“All we can do is put pressure on and see where it leaves us.”United have Peter Pawlett and Mark Connolly doubtful for the weekend.Both had to come off on Tuesday night because of muscle tightness."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"eyesore burns house knocked down","story":"South Ayrshire Councils Burns House, Burns Statue Square.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEyesore Burns House is set to be torn down this upcoming year. Staff working at the South Ayrshire Council building in Ayr will be relocated to other offices to allow work to get underway. The move means historic Burns Statue Square will be completely transformed. The decision was announced as part of the council’s budget for the year, which comes into effect next month. The cost to flatten the office block is estimated to be £. million. Council leader, the SNP’s Douglas Campbell said: “We will relocate staff from Burns House into properties already owned by the council in Ayr and other town centres to continue to support the local day time economy.” Speaking during his budget speech, he added:”This will result in the demolishing of Burns House commencing during this financial year.” Meanwhile across the road the crumbling Station Hotel remains covered over as question marks hang over its future. It is understood ScotRail staff will neverto the dangerous building. It is believed they are to be housed in new portable cabins across the railway line at empty ground on Station Road. The option of a new new transport hub being built in the vicinity of Burns Statue Square has been mooted in the past. But no solid plan has emerged. Councillor Campbell said: “We maintain dialogue with the Scottish Government, Transport Scotland and Network Rail about future investment at the station. Once we are clearer about their intentions we will begin discussions on the future of Burns Statue Square. “ The council’s former regeneration contractor Ayr Renaissance was tasked with hiring consultants to redesign the space at the top of the High Street.

Police objected to McLelland getting a personal licence at the council’s licensing board meeting heard last week, McLelland, , of Main Street, Auchinleck carried out the crime in November . Police Sergeant David Dougan told councillors McLelland was sentenced to a community payback order at Ayr Sherf Court last year as punishment. But McLelland said she was plagued by anti-social behaviour outside at her home in Main Street. She told the board: “I love kids. I regret it.” She claims she has had problems with people “chapping her door” and urinating in her garden. She rushed out to the nearby bus shelter during one incident, she told the meeting.. McLelland said: “I went out. It wasn’t even raw bleach. It is not an excuse. I shouldn’t have done it.” She claimed the bottle was kicked out of her hand and spilled over the victim. But the meeting heard McLelland pled guilty in court. The shop worker said: “I am not in the habit of going out and fighting with kids. “I am a -year-old woman.” She added: “Everybody in this le makes mistakes. Nobody in this world is perfect.” She told the meeting she had phoned the police numerous times to report anti-social behaviour at her property. Councillors adjourned the meeting to discuss whether she should be handed a licence. Ontheir opinion was split with three councillors voting to grant her application and the same number against. Board Chair Councillor Tom Cook had the ruling say and decided to grant McLelland’s licence. He said giving her the licence would not increase her chances of committing a similar offence in the future. Councillors George Mair, John Campbell and Fiona Campbell voted to refuse the licence. Councilors Drew Filson, Lillian Jones supported Councillor Cook’s view to grant it. Councillor Cook said he would grant the licence “albeit with reservations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilCourtsJusticeAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"people say future high rise","story":"NewsPeople to have their say on the future of high-rise flats in AyrTenants asked for their preferred optionShareByGary Fanning:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTenants in the Riverside Place multi-storey flats in Ayr are getting the chance to have their say on the future of the high-rise properties as South Ayrshire Council’s consultation on ‘Your place, your future’ gets underway. The consultation and engagement exercise – approved by Councillors last year – gives tenants the chance to choose their preferred option for the long-term future of the flats: Refurbish  – this means the Council would keep the flats, decant tenants, carry out identied refurbishment works, and thentenants to their refurbished flats. Rehouse  – this means tenants would be rehoused permanently in suitable alternative accommodation and the flats would be demolished. Rebuild  – this means tenants would be decanted to temporary accommodation and the flats would be demolished before some tenantsto a new-build housing development on the Riverside Place site. The detailed consultation, which is based around inidual one-to-one meetings with more than  tenants, has been planned in conjunction with the River Ayr Tenants Association, which represents tenants in the three blocks. The Council has communicated regularly with tenants in the lead-up to the consultation to ensure they have all the information they need to take part. A further letter has now been distributed to homes in Riverside Place following queries and concerns raised by tenants regarding a letter sent to them by Fort, Seafield  Wallacetown Community Council. The community council’s letter appears to query the three consultation options being discussed with tenants and questions South Ayrshire Council’s interpretation of the expert report approved last year regarding the “essential and advisable” works required to the flats. Councillor Philip Saxton, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Housing and Community Wellbeing, said: “We are committed to ensuring that our tenants are fully involved in the discussions about the future of their flats, which is why we’re taking such a detailed approach to this consultation. “It’s vital that tenants understand all the facts so they can form their own views about the option that is best for them. That is why we have gone back out to them to respond to the queries and confusion that have been generated by the community council’s letter. “We fully appreciate that the community council may have a view on the consultation, which is why colleagues are meeting with them next week and we’re happy to keep them informed about the consultation and engagement process. “However, our focus – which was clearly expressed by tenants at the recent River Ayr Tenants Association meeting – has to be on hearing the views of those who will be directly affected by Councillors’ decisions later this year: the tenants of Riverside Place. “We thank them for their participation in the consultation and I can reassure them that their views will be taken into account before any decisions are taken about the future of Riverside Place.” Joe Lafferty, Chair of the River Ayr Tenants Association, said: “We have worked closely with the Council over the last couple of years as discussions around the future of the flats have moved forward – and we very much appreciate the approach the Council has taken. “It is for every tenant to consider what is the best option for them and to ensure their voice is heard by those who will be making the decisions about what happens next. Clear facts, easy to understand information and answers to the questions tenants have is what’s needed and that’s exactly what we have got from the Council.”   Feedback from the consultation will be considered by Councillors in June this year.Full details of the Riverside Place consultation are available at  www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk riverside-place .

The Post can exclusively reveal that the developers McCarthy  Stone have thrown in the towel and withdrawn their multi-million pound proposals. Major question marks hang over the building’s future following the bombshell announcement. The news prompted an angry backlash from Derek Hart, chair of Prestwick North Community Council. In an extraordinary outburst he claimed the building has been “plundered and left to rot.” The building provided a retreat for children battling cancer for more than  years. It was opened by Princess Diana in . In  it was sold by owners Clic Sargent after claims of a “challenging fundraising environment”. They sold it to McCarthy  Stone and trousered £.m from the deal. However, since McCarthy  Stone took ownership and unveiled their luxury flat plans they have been embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. Other objections included the potential impact it would have had on their historic course and the surrounding conservation area. In addition, there were fears that errant balls could smash into residents’ properties. Plans involved building  flats for people aged over , spread out in a T-shape over four floors. Many would have had sea views and balconies. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work on the former retreat had to stop. It was estimated that  jobs would be created between the construction phase and posts at the new development. Despite a PR charm offensive from McCarthy  Stone throughout the process and a public exhibition of plans at the  Club in Prestwick’s Main Street, the developers pulled the plug on the project. A spokesperson said: “Following a strategic review last year we are no longer pursuing any new developments within Scotland and have withdrawn our plans for Prestwick.” Derek Hart reckons the decision is a kick in the teeth for all the campaigners who fought to retain the presence of a sick children’s home in Prestwick. He told the Post: “I find this action taken by McCarthy  Stone not only deplorable but a slap in the face to the Save Malcolm Sargent House team who fought bravely to try to purchase it. “Is it not time for South Ayrshire Council to stop and listen to the community  “The community stated that the development would only feather the nests of McCarthy  Stone – and perhaps chemists –as the age group targeted by them were over  years. “There’s been very little input to Prestwick and we are now left with a building that has been plundered and left to rot. “Will we find the same response to the other end of the beach, at the old Gym, I wonder ”He added: “Time after time SAC have allowed developers to build as they wish with barely a challenge to the character ofthe town and how it should look.”The news will be viewed as a major victory for Prestwick Golf Club, who fought long and hard against the development. A statement by the club said: “While we welcome this news we hope that, should a new development proposal for the site be put forward in the future, the design and scale will be more sympathetic to the surrounding area.” The statement said the club was not against the principle of redeveloping the site but was “disappointed” at the scale and design of the proposed development. It added: “We believed that McCarthy  Stone hadn’t listened to the concerns raised by the club.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrincess DianaSouth Ayrshire CouncilRoyal FamilyPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"shopper yelled get back your","story":"NewsShopper yelled \"Get back to your own country, you Iraqi b******\" to Ayr Lidl workerManus McGhee avoided jail after his foul mouth outburst at the store.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsThe outburst took place at Lidl in Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who was asked to leave Ayr’s Lidl store went back in to racially abuse a staff member, writes Edwin Lawrence.

Super-fit Fiona McBlane was , practised yoga and cycled and was in London lapping up a glamorous working le in the music industry for companies such as EMI and Smash Hits. But during a Christmas visit home to Ayrshire she fell unwell with leg, arm and head pain. Such was her distress she admitted herself to hospital. First the minor stroke hit - on January ,  - and then the searing biggie nine days later. It left her semi-paralysed in hospital for  months, unable to speak, hardly walking and retaining very limited brain capacity. That was when Clan McBlane rallied round to give her the best future they could. They had been advised the best place for her was an old folks home but they stood firm. Once Fiona was fit enough to leave hospital she was brought into the bosom of the family in Prestwick. Twelve years on at the age of , Fiona is battling away and has got to the stage where she has joined the gym at Prestwick Tennis Club. Her loving older sisters Gillian McBlane, , and -year-old Gaenor Hardy have just pounded round the Stroke Association’s Resolution Run with Gillian’s -year-old son Graham to continue raising money for the charity. That added £ to a total now of about £. Gillian, a top civil lawyer in Ayr, and Gaenor, headmistress at Heathfield Primary, assist their parents Jean and Ian who are Fiona’s full-time carers. And Gillian is helped by the other legal eagle in the family, Ayr criminal defence agent Steven Maxwell. Gillian said: “She loved her work and was a real high flier. “People were drawn to Fiona’s fun-loving nature and her great big heart. “Never for a minute did we think she would have a stroke. “At  years old she had lost everything she loved.” Fiona is prone to falling and choking, often passing out. Sometimes the enormity of what has happened becomes too much for her and she struggles emotionally. But Gillian said: “Our parents taught us to look for the positive things in le and not to feel sorry for ourselves. We spend time together and Fiona enjoys the company. “Despite the extent of her disability, she does brilliantly. “Doctors told us that her friends would eventually tail off but Fiona’s haven’t . They keep in contact with her and visit when they can. “People have shown us great kindness over the years in so many ways and this means a lot, helping us immensely. We don’t know what the future will hold for Fiona but we do know that whatever it is we will face it together.” There are , strokes in Scotland every year. Angela Macleod at the Stroke Association said: “Our latest research shows that by training and taking part in a Resolution Run you are helping to lower your stroke risk. “The funds raised by each runner means we can reach out to more stroke survivors and their families to offer the support that they may need to rebuild their lives.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnstrokeAyrAyr NewsPrestwickRunningCharity"},{"url":null,"title":"upper crust roost alloway","story":"NewsAn Upper Crust roost in AllowayAyrshire Post Property of the WeekShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere are few better places to bring up a family than the secluded suburban streets of Alloway.

how does a small childs cross pose a risk to anyone \"And from what we were told, they were going to inform familiesa stone required work to make it safe.\"There are now broken gravestones lying all over our cemetery - this wasnt a safety inspection.\"Scottish Borders Council is responsible for  cemeteries across the region.And they have health and safety obligations for all employees, contractors and visitors to each of the graveyards.Although headstones are the responsibility of the lair-holder, due to the age of many graves tracing families is dficult.A five-year rolling programme of safety checks began in September with  cemeteries earmarked for the initial checks.But for several families the heavy-handed testing regime - which has left many memorials broken - has come as a shock.One daughter, who we agreed not to name, said: \"My parents grave is neither old nor what you would describe as large, yet it has been taken from its base.\"I have been really upset by this -I or any of my family had known the stone was loose we would have had it repaired.\"Nobody has been in touch with me or my brother.\"According to the Scottish Borders Councils own guidelines on the testing procedures, an initial sight test would be followed,required, by a gentle hand push.All memorials were to be classed as either stable, slight movement or unsafe.And only memorials found to be in a dangerous condition will be cordoned off and or made safe.The guidance also states that they will ensure the work is undertaken with due respect and only when absolutely necessary.Scottish Borders Council has defended the testing procedures by the contracted company.A spokesman for the authority told us: \"The council took the decision to test all the headstones in the old section of Peebles Cemetery, regardless of size and age, following a risk assessment.\"This is part of a phased approach to testing which sees sections of cemeteries categorised based on estimated footfall, age, location and size of the memorials.\"So far the majority of unstable memorials tested across the Borders have been made safe by socketing, which means keeping the headstone upright with the majority of the inscription still visible for families and visitors to read.\"This is a recognised approach which balances the cultural importance associated with these historic memorials and the need to keep our cemeteries safe for the public to visit.\"Socketing is the preferred technique compared to other alternative methods such as lying flat, staking, banding or full repair, all of which carry signicant consequences to the future stability of the memorials or signicant costs.\"A total of  headstones were tested in Peebles Cemetery with  deemed unsafe.Council bosses have admitted they will discuss issues over stones being broken during the inspection.The spokesman added: \"We accept that during this signicant safety programme, and considering the nature of the memorials that we are dealing with, there will be occasions where a memorial can become damaged while being made safe.\"If anyone notices a memorial which they have a legal interest in and which they believe has been damaged during the process of making it safe, they can contact the council to discuss the matter further.\"Other graveyards which are included in the initial phase of inspections are Innerleithen, Wairds , Shawfield , Ashkirk, Earlston, Heriot, Lilliesleaf, Kelsoand Kelso , Ancrum, Denholm, Wellogateand Wilton , Ayton, Duns, Lennel and Eyemouth.Babies graves, war graves and many brokenWhere a memorial is classied as unsafe and there is an immediate safety concern, thememorial will be made safe. If a memorial is cordoned off or pocketed, the family, who areresponsible for the memorial can contact us and arrange for it to be made safe themselves.Memorials will be laid flatthere is no other practical way of making them safe.If it is found that a large number of memorials are unsafe within a section of the cemetery,we will fence off the whole area.

The objectors also presented evidence to the committee showing how their own planning policies were being ignored by their officials.Peebles Community Council and many residents objected to the land at South Parks site being earmarked for development in the Local Development Plan back in .Mr Turnbull said: ldquoWhat makes objectors particularly annoyed is the notion that once building sites have been included in Local Development Plans, their inclusion cannot be questioned.\"Their views then were ignored just as their views have been totally ignored now. One of the questions that needs to be asked is, why Mr Turnbull said the conduct of the planning committee with the housing application was ldquoappalling and added that the system is loaded in favour of developers.He added: ldquoWell over  dferent objectors submitted some very detailed evidence to planners who ignored it.\"This has brought many objectors to question the validity of the planning process. It would appear that this process is designed to allow developers to build as and when they want and they can appealtheir application is refused.ldquoObjectors on the other hand have no right of appeal given that they have no right of appeal it is surely essential that they are given a fair hearing where evidence is properly considered.ldquoIn the South Parks case, Councillor Fullarton made comments regarding the Caledonian Road being wide and safe, based on his knowledge of over  years ago - no one challenged him.ldquoWhat has caused so much anger was that not a single councillor on the committee knew enough about Peebles to question Councillor Fullartonrsquos assertion. It may be that the planning committee has insufficient time to deal properly with these more complicated and contentious applicationsthat is the case then something has to change.ldquoThey simply failed to understand the issues before them nor the tremendous amount of anger within our community.\"The Scottish Government has launched an initiative called Democracy Matters, which aims to improve the level of involvement of local communities.Mr Turnbull continued: ldquoWhat is the pointplanning officers can write what they want, ignore government guidance and legislation, which is then allowed to stand by councillors who either do not have the knowledge to challenge them or the will to do so. For democracy to matter the peoplesrsquo voice needs to be heard.The community leader says the democratic deficit will be brought into sharp focus with the next Local Development plan, and heeded a warning to elected councillors to be prepared to answer why Peebles is mooted for major development when Scottish Borders Council is not prepared to develop infrastructure first.Scottish Borders Council strongly refutes the claims that councillors and officials ignored the views of the community.A spokesperson said: ldquoAll planning decisions require the delicate balancing of a range of policy objectives and other material factors, including the views expressed by the Community Council.\"The two recent planning applications in Peebles highlighted how dficult that can be and the complexity of the decision making process. Both proposals were subject to detailed analysis, which was reflected in the presentation of the cases by officers and the y debate members had on these applications.ldquoIt is clear that a considerable amount of time was spent considering the points and issues made both for and against the proposed developments. Indeed, both applications were revised to take into consideration the views expressed by local residents and the Community Council.ldquoUltimately, and after considering all of the evidence before them, the Committee came to the view that it could support one of the applications, which was the development at South Parks. The application at Tweedbridge Court was refused."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-peer-lord-steel-suspended-from-lib-dems-after-giving-evidence-about-cyril-smith","story":"BORDERS peer Lord Steel has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats, pending an investigation into evidence he gave to an inquiry about child abuse allegations against former MP Sir Cyril Smith.The move, announced by the Scottish Liberal Democrats, comes after Lord Steel, a former Scottish Parliament presiding officer, gave evidence to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuseon Wednesday.The party had already announced they have started disciplinary proceedings against him, after he told the probe a conversation with Smith left him \"assuming\" the allegations were correct, but the party did not investigate them.The decision followed a meeting of senior figures within the Scottish party on Thursday evening.In a subsequent statement, the Scottish Liberal Democrats said: \"Following the evidence concerning Cyril Smith given by Lord Steel to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse on th March , the office bearers of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have met and agreed that an investigation is needed.\"The party membership of Lord Steel has been suspended pending the outcome of that investigation. That work will now commence.\"It is important that everyone in the party, and in wider society, understands the importance of vigilance and safeguarding to protect people from abuse, and that everyone has confidence in the seriousness with which we take it.\"We appreciate the dficult work that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is doing on behalf of the victims and survivors of abuse, and the country as a whole.\"At the inquiry Lord Steel denied he had been \"hiding his head in the sand\" over the child abuse allegations made against the former Rochdale MP.Lord Steel said he asked the late politician in  about claims that he abused boys at a Rochdale hostel, and found they dated back to Smiths time as a Labour councillor in the s.He told the inquiry he came away from the conversation with Smith \"assuming\" he had committed the offences, because he did not deny them.Lord Steel recalled Smith had told him police had investigated the claims and taken no action.The IICSA heard no formal inquiry was then held by the Liberal Party into the claims.On the suggestion that no action was taken then because Lord Steel did not want to get involved in a nasty confrontation with Smith, he told the hearing: \"I wouldnt have been hiding my head in the sand.\"These allegations all related to a period some years before he was even an MP and before he was even a member of the party, therefore it did not seem to me that I had any position in the matter at all.\"Smith, who was an MP for Rochdale between  and , is accused of sexually abusing a number of boys.Allegations against him found a greater public spotlight after he died in .,params: .pushLord Steels conversation with Smith was prompted by a story in Private Eye.It came after the Rochdale Alternative Press published a story in  saying police had investigated Smith over allegations of abuse against teenagers at the Cambridge House hostel in the town.Lord Steel told the inquiry: \"He accepted the story was correct.

The Langlee Woods is very popular with walkers, and cyclists, and I know therersquos a good and a bad with everything and some of the cyclists come down the tracks without any idea of where theyrsquore going and who might be going to meet them.ldquoThe other thing that concerns is me is that in Langlee and Ladhope golf course, I donrsquot want to see any parking in these areas.ldquoIt has to be discouraged. The road up to Langlee Mains Farm is not suitable for the type of cycles yoursquore talking about, itrsquos a narrow, twisty road with zones of invisibility.ldquoIf there is to be parking, I suggest you look where.Councillors voted unanimously to submit the plans to the public for consultation, and for a report to be brought back to the committee in the future.Council officers also confirmed that the trail network will require planning permission, which will give residents a second opportunity to submit their thoughts on the development."},{"url":null,"title":"iceland-store-boss-admits-ignoring-21-parking-tickets","story":"A SUPERMARKET manager has been hit with a four figure bill after ignoring a y string of parking tickets.David Humphries car was frequently ticketed over several months after being parked in a pay and display area behind the Iceland store in High Street, Galashiels, where he works.But the -year-old never paid the tickets or answered letters from the Scottish Borders Council asking him to reveal the identication of the driver, so the fines could be sent to the culprit.Now he has been fined a whopping pound, for ignoring the council letters - pound for each offence - and there is still a pound bill outstanding for the  original parking offences between April and July last year.Humphries of Bourtree Place, Hawick, pleaded guilty at Selkirk JP Court to a total of  charges.Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser told the court that there was no CCTV in the car park showing who had come to collect the car on the days of the offences and Humphries had never informed the council of the identity of the driver despite the repeated requests.But he pointed out Humphries worked in the Iceland store which is right beside the High Street car park.Mr Fraser also said that failing to reveal the identity of the driver carried a maximum penalty of pound, for each offence.He explained that the council had to go through the laborious process of establishing who the regular keeper of the vehicle was and to find out who the driver was for the penalty to be paid.Mr Fraser said:\"In relation to all these charges he ignored the correct parking penalty which was not paid.\"There were other people who could have used this car parkspace but have not been able to do so.\"The accuseds vehicle repeatedly committed the offences of being parked overtime.\"Who did that we do not know as the accused did not bother to communicate with the council and say who the driver was which is a legal requirement.\"Not guilty pleas to nine other charges relating to the parking offences were accepted by the Crown.Defence lawyer Colin Severin said his client was negotiating with the council about the outstanding parking fines.He added: \"He got to the point where he was bogged down with the volume of letters coming through and did not know how to react.\"Andrew Bramhall JP told Humphries that ulging the identity of the identity of the driver when an offence is committed was an important part of the Road Traffic Act legislation.He said: \"The onus was on you and it has mounted up considerably.\"Mr Bramhall said he would have fined Humphries pound for each offence but restricted the fine to pound due to the guilty plea.As there were  offences, the fine totalled pound -

Craig Galbraith worked well playing with, eventual man of the match, Calum Johnson for the first time.In the th minute there was a skirmish in the box after a corner, Johnson cleared the ball but it ricocheted off the incoming player into the net.The Glasgow students had more possession with the wind advantage. With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"kspbs novice b band impresses","story":"Last Sunday#s Livingston performance was the first time a pipe band of any grade from Campbeltown has taken part in these championships and it was dficult for them to know what to expect.The band was in a category of  others and they needed a good performance, to get a place, as there were a number of top bands playing.Kintyre Schools Band, the top band from a non-fee-paying school, gave a great performance playing Sweet Maid of Glendarual, Greenwood side, Fairwell to Aberdeen and Campbell’s Fairwell to Redcastle.After everyone had played it was over to the judges and the Novice B band was placed as follows: piping adjudicatorone: J Wilson # , PA two:  J Connor-, drumming adjudicator: A Dudgeon-, ensemble adjudicator-D Brown-.When added together this gave the Campbeltown band a total of  points and gave them a very credible fourth place and only two points off the second placed band.After the results were confirmed Pipe Major Fiona Mitchell said how proud she was of her young band and thought th place was a very good start to the season.Both KPBA bands, KSPB and Beinn an Tuirc Kintyre are now practicing hard for the first major pipe band competition of the season when the bands perform at the British Championships in Paisley on Saturday May .KSPB Novice B band perform at Livingston.

cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself, the SNP group and councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important Councillor Kelly and I, along with other council opposition groups, thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

That novel was widely lambasted for its so-called profanity, which so shocked one judge, Rabbi Julia Neuberger, she stormed out of the meeting. ldquoOver my dead body was the mildest of her comments.About a year ago, Kelman finished a new novel which, he revealed, has still to find a publisher. After a long period with Secker  Warburg and Hamish Hamilton, he moved to Canongate with his last two books, That Was a Shiver, and Dirt Road, both of which were well received. But this new manuscript languishes, untouched and apparently unloved. Nobody, it seems, even in his own heath, is willing to make a decent offer for it.With some writers, you could understand. Thanks to technology that registers every sale, publisherscan see exactly how bankable their books are. When approached by a writer, they can track their performance at the click of a mouse. If this is healthy, they are far more likely to pounce on them thanthe novelistrsquos sales have not even covered their advance, leaving a publisher effectively in the red.This does not, of course, mean the novelist is no good. Sometimes it indicates the reverse. Literary fiction is a highly raried taste ndash as it always was. Only the most fortunate of such writers make a good living from the proceeds of books alone. For most it is a struggle to get by, hence the number finding shelter teaching on creative writing courses. Kelman himself went down that route for a time, but you can be fairly sure thathis books had sold like airport bestsellers, there would have been no need to find a financial cushion.In what you can only call the good old days, a young writer like Graham Greene would be given considerable leeway with his early books by a publisher confident that one day he would reward their patience. Today, there is no slack in the system, no time to nurture or take the long view. You are only as good as your last book. And in the case of someone like Kelman, whose readership is a mere fraction of those interested in serious fiction, that spells trouble.Why do most of those who leap on every title by Julian Barnes or Rose Tremain often not bother with Kelman  Undoubtedly, the furore over his Booker winner damaged his reputation, not only in the rest of the UK, but also here. Kelman, however, suspects there is a more fundamental and disturbing reason. He believes that English publishers are ldquokeeping a lid on Scottish writers, by dismissing them as a genre. They would rather publish mediocre English novelists, he says, than good Scottish ones.Read more: Kelman: British establishment is keeping a lid on Scottish writingThere are enough excellent Scottish novelists reaching print to argue that point, but for me this is a distraction from the main issue. EvenKelman is right and there is anti-Scottish bias among literary publishers, that still does not explain why no Scottish publisher is willing to take him on.Could his new book be too dficult, or tricky  It would seem strangethat were the case, given his long and distinguished backlist in which there is rarely a misfire. The answer is far more likely to be about money, and the state of the book trade in general. In other words, there is no publisher able or prepared to offer a fee commensurate with what a Kelman book is worth. Thatrsquos worth in artistic terms, you understand, not sales. I do not doubt it would be a better investment to publish Diana Gabaldonfilling the coffers is the main objective.But while the kind of books Kelman writes are unlikely to shower a publisher in gold, they would add immeasurably to its lustre. Here is a novelist who has been shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, and is a worthy Nobel contender. Indeed, consider this my official plea to the Nobel Prize Literature Committee to read everything Kelman has written and tell us his oeuvre does not equal or surpass many of their laureates.Yet, nobody on his doorstep wants to take his new book. Itrsquos hard to think of another country where its foremost living writer would be treated like this. The only conclusion you can come to is that the world of books has lost it.

The figure provided by the Scottish Government represents the percentage of the total S roll who went on to secure five Highers - including those who didnrsquot sit Highers at all.That means schools such as those in the suburbs of East Renfrewshire are always likely to appear at the top of league tables because a majority of pupils in S go on to take Highers.Read more:Revealed: The top  state schools in Scotland Research tells us repeatedly that the factor that has the single biggest impact on exam results is deprivation, and this is clearly seen in our tables.Poverty has an impact on attainment from birth, meaning pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds fall behind early on in terms of literacy and numeracy and continue to lag behind because of the range of social problems they experience as they grow up.It is no accident, therefore, that schools in areas with very signicant levels of deprivation are almost always lower down the league tables than those in middle class areas.Many of the top  state schools in Scotland according to our tables have no pupils at all from the most deprived backgrounds.

Abuses of power are only possible because such power exists in the first place and because the land market is so open to anyone from anywhere in the world.Quite literally, the market is unregulated and, as the Commission notes, the evidence demonstrates a pattern of market and social power associated with landownership that is consistent with characteristics of monopoly power in other economic sectors. Indeed,land was subject to the powers of the Competitions and Markets Authority, there would be a clear case for intervention.The report notes that market and social power can damage the public interest, that detrimental impacts on communities are a product of a concentration of power and that Scotland would benefit from a far more erse pattern of power over land. Importantly, this is not simply a question of private landownership but also public.Scottish Ministers are themselves by far the largest landowner in Scotland and there is a strong case for decentralising some of this power to local councils, communities and iniduals.Land reform to date has tinkered at the margins for too long. There is nothing in this report that comes as a surprise to land reformers but it is refreshing to read advice from a government agency that tackles this question head on and recommends new powers of intervention as well as reform in the way that land is taxed.If Scottish Ministers approve these recommendations then we could be on the brink of resolving the central problem of Scottish landownership, namely the centuries-long persistence of hegemonic landed power.I am not holding my breath, however. Scottish Ministers have had opportunities to act ndash on inheritance law and on land taxation and have avoided both. If this report is to be the tipping point that it could be, Government needs to be far clearer about its intentions and timescales.Above all we need to move beyond debates about community ownership, important thought that is. The reason many communities find themselves having to contemplate the prospect of landownership is solely because of the failings of the current system that is open to abuse and speculative financial gain by external interests.Admittedly, such reforms take time and the path ahead is strewn with legal and political challenges. Today in Parliament, we will be debating the topic and I will be inviting Parliament to agree with the findings of the Commission. Such agreement would provide a clear expression of the will of the people of Scotland to turn the clock on centuries of landed power and make land an asset for the many and not the few."},{"url":null,"title":"clydesdale-bank-hunger-striker-has-received-tremendous-support-from-glasgow","story":"John Guidi, from Bothwell, pitched a tent outside the CYBG headquarters on St Vincent Place on Sunday and has not eaten since.He is protesting against the banks handling of his business loan repayments which may result in the loss of his home.Mr Guidi told our sister title the Evening Times he is ldquoa desperate man, in a desperate place and the strike is ldquostarting to take its toll.He said: ldquoItrsquos pretty hard, Irsquom quite tired and quite cold.

He set out that, between -, tourism numbers have increased by an impressive  per cent to almost , people with an estimated value of nearly £m.Mr McArthur warned that this success could not be taken for granted and presented its own challenges. As well as urging ministers to resolve the stand-off over RET and provide support for the replacement Orkney’s ageing internal ferry fleet, the Orkney MSP also repeated his call for Orkney’s world-class heritage sites to be backed by world-class infrastructure.Speaking after the debate, he said: #Tourism is one of the few sectors that touches almost every part of the country and it is one where Orkney has been punching above its weight over recent years.#With the natural assets we have and a lot of hard work by those involved in all aspects of the tourism sector locally, Orkney has seen visitor numbers and income increase signicantly over recent years. This success has brought awards and recognition, but it also brings with it challenges.#Everyone knows that Orkney’s reputation for quality requires the tourist experience to be managed carefully. This will involve taking pressure off key sites as well as making more of what Orkney has to offer.#It also needs Scottish Government to step up to the plate, not least when it comes to transport links. The long-overdue introduction of RET would help Orkney remain competitive as a destination, while replacement of the ageing internal ferry fleet is not only vital for the islands they serve but a means of encouraging visitors to explore more widely once they get here.“Ministers also have a role to play, through Historic Environment Scotland, in helping ensure that Orkney’s world-class heritage sites are supported by high-quality infrastructure. Local partners, including Destination Orkney and the Council, must be closely involved but investment through HES is crucial to making this happen.“There is good reason to believe that Orkney can continue playing to its strengths when it comes to tourism and there will be plenty of opportunities over the years ahead showcase our islands.  However, we cannot be complacent about what it will take to maintain and enhance Orkney’s reputation for good quality”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She did put herself forward to be the Prime Minister in charge of delivering Brexit but it has surely been a much tougher task than she could have possibly expected.She has made missteps on the way. She decided to reach out for support to hardline Brexiteers in her own party and the DUP. The result of that decision was a deal that almost no one likes – least of all the hardliners she hoped would back her.If only she had looked to Remainers who accepted the  referendum result, the UK could now be preparing for an orderly, sensible Brexit, one that caused the least possible damage to the economy.May did get some things right, ignoring the advice of Donald Trump, as Donald Trump Jr sulkily pointed out in an article in theyesterday. Unfortunately, Brexit Britain will be in no position to ignore Trump for much longer as we seek a much-needed trade deal with the US, negotiating from a position of weakness against a man who believes himself to be the world’s greatest deal-maker and whose stated priorities are to “Make America Great Again” and put “America First”.

Who would have thought that after her Brexit plan suffered the biggest defeat in Commons history, we’d still be talking about it – and still even after a second, smaller landslide defeat. But we are.However even she must now realise that a third strike would mean she would, finally, be out. No one could say she didn’t do her best to ensure that “Brexit means Brexit”. It would be the fault of others – chief among them the foolishly optimistic hardliners –it does not occur.For the umpteenth time, The Scotsman will advise MPs who wish Brexit to happen to vote for May’s plan. It’s far from ideal. It would be betterwe stayed in the EU. But it avoids the utter disaster of a no-deal Brexit. If it fails again, May should resign, but her last duty would be to ensure that the consequence of this was not a no-deal.

Perhaps more dficult to envisage is donating one of your kidneys to a complete stranger, someone you will never meet nor know for sure how much their le was changed by your gt.Last week we celebrated living donor awareness week and ten years since the first altruistic kidney donation in Scotland. To date,  other Scots have also willingly undergone surgery to donate a kidney to a stranger. What motivates such an inidual to come forward The story that will always stay with me is Emma’s. While she cared for her husband during the end of his le due to cancer she had wished it was possible for someone to tap her on the shoulder and whisper – we’ve had a call, everything is going to be alright. After reflection following his death, she decided to be an altruistic kidney donor so that she could be that ‘tap on the shoulder’ for a complete stranger.For someone in need of a transplant, a kidney from a living donor is the best possible treatment. Le expectancy is enhanced and, as an additional benefit, the cost-saving for the NHS compared with dialysis is signicant. Success rates are excellent, over  per cent of living donor kidney transplants are ing at five years.: One in ten people ‘could opt out of proposed organ donor system’An altruistic donor started the kidney transplant chain for Julie. She desperately wanted a transplant so that she and her husband could look forward to a le free from the restrictions of dialysis, they hoped to start their own family. Many family members came forward but were found not to be suitable. Julie’s brother-in-law Steven came forward. He was not able to donate directly to her but they entered the national kidney sharing scheme. When a match was identied, Julie received a kidney from an altruistic donor and Steven donated on the same day to another person on the kidney transplant waiting list. Steven has ed to running marathons and I was so delighted to hear that Julie and her husband are now proud parents of a baby girl.The UK kidney sharing scheme allows incompatible pairs to match up with other pairs around the country, opening the door to transplant for many dficult to match recipients. From January , all altruistic donors are included in this matching, to start a chain of transplants – just like Julie’s chain. I wonder about the altruistic donor though. They do not see the le-transforming dference their kidney made to Julie and all her family. Minimal information is shared – part of the anonymity agreement.: Half of Scots now registered for organ donationWe learned a great deal from the stories publicised during living donor awareness week – the ‘secret smile’ of satisfaction that a donor has transformed a person’s le the pride, the sense of well-being, the satisfaction in being able to do such an act of kindness and altruism for another.So to all the people in Scotland who have donated to a loved one, over  in the past  years and a record  in , and to the altruistic donors in Scotland over the past  years and those yet to come, thank you for being that tap on the shoulder for someone in need.Dr Catherine Calderwood is Scotland’s Chief Medical Officer and she’s grateful to Jen Lumsdaine, living kidney transplant co-ordinator, and Dr Wendy Metcalfe for their contribution to this article.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"fmqs nicola sturgeon says independence only solution to broken westminster","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has told the Scottish Parliament independence is the only solution tothe \"broken government\" of Westminster after the chaos of Brexit.It came as the pro-independence Greens heaped the pressure on the SNP leaderto set out her plans for a second independence referendum in response at First Ministers Questions today.\u2028Ms Sturgeon also called on Mrs May to revoke Article  and halt the Brexit processshe loses a third vote on her Withdrawal deal next week.Read more: Brexit: Theresa May could quitUK doesn’t leave EU by end of June\u2028Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie called for a second referendum at Holyrood today, which Ms Sturgeon has pledged to give Scots an alternative to Brexit.\u2028\"Scotland needs the freedom to take a dferent direction,leave behind this chaos and find our own way out of the crisis,\" Mr Harvie said.\u2028\"Its why we need our independence.

These brave and hardworking police officers should not be discriminated against because they don’t threaten to go on strike.“The First Minister needs to apologise for being so dismissive of his concerns.”In the letter, the anonymous officer said: “Why has such a massive importance been placed on the pay rise for school teachers when other public service staff are not being awarded nearly as much as a pay rise “Does the Scottish Government place the value of police officers as only half that of school teachers  Is it that the Government know that because police officers cannot strike or take any real industrial action that they are an easy target ”A spokesman for the First Minister later said that she would not apologise as her \"disgraceful\" comment was not directed at the police officer but at Graham Simpson.During First Ministers Questions, Mr Simpson was booed by SNP backbenchers as he read out the letter, and asked what Nicola Sturgeon would say to the officer and “thousands of others” like him.Ms Sturgeon went on to say: “In terms of our NHS workers many get higher pay in Scotland than they do in England because of the value we attach to the work that they do.“In terms of teachers they have now been offered an exceptionally good pay deal and I think that is recognition of the good work that they do and I hope that is now accepted.“But I value all public sector workers and I thinkyou look at any group of public sector workers you will find that the value attached to them by the Scottish Government is much much greater than the value attached to their counterparts in England by the Tory government at Westminster.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it.

So who do we as communities need to be kept safe from  Andcredit is given to paramilitaries in some areas, and perhaps even in some political circles, then what does that say about the PSNI ”DUP MLA Joanne Bunting added: “What is common across all communities is that the vast majority want to see society rid of these groups.”According to PSNI figures from March  to February , there were:• Two security related deaths •  paramilitary-style shootings, all but two in Belfast or ‘Derry City’ and Strabane•  paramilitary-style assaults, most in Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey and Ards and North Down•  bombing and  shooting incidents•  persons arrested for terrorism-related activity, mainly in Belfast and ‘Derry City’ and Strabane, the districts with the greatest number of bombings and shootings, with  people subsequently charged."},{"url":null,"title":"ni climbing frames is tops","story":"A cutting-edge business programme designed to support and grow local micro and small sized enterprises has engaged with over  local companies during the last four years and successfully helped create over  jobs across the Borough.The innovative Business Engagement Programme , managed by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, provides tailored mentoring to businesses – with NI Climbing Frames being one such company to avail of this assistance.Based in Banbridge, NI Climbing Frames design, manufacture and install climbing frames for both the private and commercial market.

The Glen Road man’s first job was as a compositor printer with Pitman’s University Press. However, during these early working days, he undertook voluntary youth work within the greater West Belfast area and soon realised that this was where his future lay. Eventually Pat left Belfast for Leicester University where he achieved his degree in youth and social care, following this up with a Master’s degree from the Ulster University. Pat eventually became a youth worker in charge at St Michael’s Youth Club, Finaghy Road North, where he spent many happy years. During this time, Pat managed a number of the youth football teams, with home games being played at Woodlands playing fields. Pat’s brothers commented that to say he was “vocerous” in his coaching would be an “understatement”. “In fact the story goes that at this time, house prices in Orchardville depreciated by  per cent!”At a time when West Belfast was often in turmoil, the youth club was a haven for young people a place where parents knew their children would be safe. Pat took this onboard and enabled the young people in his care to reach their full potential. Pat developed an insatiable love for sport from a very early age. He joined Davitt’s GAC for a short time before transferring to St Agnes’ where he spent many happy years as both a player and manager. In the course of his time with the ‘Aggies’ Pat, along with many of the players, made those never to be forgotten trips to the continent and of course Shannon events that proved to be hugely enjoyable and deeply spitural ventures. A serious arm break when he was  curtailed Pat’s playing career but he had much success in his managerial roles. Pat, affectionately known as Butsy, also loved soccer and had a long and enjoyable time playing for and supporting Dominic Savio. During the ’s, Pat embraced the basketball scene and in particular St Gall’s basketball club. Pat was committed totally to this new undertaking. In fact, his brother Gerard remembers ing back to Denewood one day and discovering a very large American making himself a cup of tea. Of course Pat had not told Gerard that ‘Soupy’ Campbell would be staying for a few days – a bit of a shock. As a commentator and administrator Pat gave  per cent to this new venture. His famous commentary during lives games in the Andersonstown Leisure Centre is still talked about.On the sporting front, Pat finally finished up as a member of Falls Bowling Club where he spent many happy years as a player, administrator and advisor to the long suffering groundsman. Pat eventually became the club president, something of which he was particular proud of. He also became president of the private greens – a role which again Pat embraced with diligence and total commitment. A spokesperson for Falls Bowling Club described Pat, their th President, as someone with a personality that “could fill the Waterfront Hall”. “His passing has left a gap that we will not attempt to fill.”Married to Shelia since August  , Pat lived le to the full, had a hugely positive influence on many and ultimately made a dference. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"history man joes lifetime in community","story":"HAVING been involved in community development for the best part of three decades, Joe Baker is a familiar face to many in North Belfast, but he is probably most recognised as one of the city’s leading resident historians.Joe has been involved with the Ashton Community Trust virtually since its inception in the early-s and now sits on its board. It was also during that time that he became involved in the Belfast History Project.Throughout his career, Joe has written, and published, books, magazines and newspaper articles for a range of media outlets during his career but, unlike some historians, his expertise grew outside the confines of traditional academia.By his own admission, he didn’t do too well at school, often “forgetting” to get off the bus at the gate. However, after ing to education at the Belfast College of Business Studies in the late s, he enrolled in history classes, which he would go on to utilise with the fledgling Belfast History Project.“I came back from college and started to get people involved in learning about the history of the area,” he explained.“From that, we discussed a number of dferent ideas. One idea we had worked on before that was cleaning up Clton Street Cemetery – which was where we used to drink our cider. It was all overgrown and wrecked at the time, but we all got together to fix it up. We tied in with people like Enterprise Ulster, and then Belfast City Council took it over and a number of volunteers came on board. Through that we developed this interest in local history.“Once the ball started rolling that was it. We started doing dferent educational projects. One of the things we started to discuss was putting a magazine together, which sounds very easy, but at that time there was this new thing coming out called a computer that you had to learn to use. Then you had to learn the computer programmes, which in those days was Pagemaker. Then you had to learn about printing and all the rest of it. Once we go up and running everything just fell into place.”The Belfast History Project has been exemplary in its endeavours, setting up groundbreaking publications and establishing history tours in long-unexplored areas of the city.“One of the good things is that when you look in Belfast city centre now and you see all the tours done here and there – blue badge this, white badge that – we get to look at it and say we did it first,” said Joe with a smile.“We did a walking tour in the Half Bap area and one of the very first tours was cancelled because of a bomb scare – not many tour operators can claim that.”The end of the conflict has ushered in a new age of competition as ious operators compete to sell tours of the ever-developing city of Belfast. While Joe believes the growing interest in local history is “brilliant” he insists branding and profits have often got in the way of fact.“People are trying to put these brands on things,” he said.“At my last count Belfast has nine-quarters. When I was at school,I was asked how many quarters there were andI had said nine I know what would’ve happened.“There is a lot of  stuff like this Tribeca development, which is a lot of nonsense.“They should do the names to reflect the history of the area. It annoys me when people try to put a  history on an area or say things that just aren’t true. We’ve always argued thatyou’re going to do history you should tell the truth. I love to see the tourism industry grow and change, but as long as they stick to a principle of truth.”Having started as a small local initiative, the Belfast History Project has flourished over the years, and now provides tours all over Europe, with their Russian tours booked up for nearly two years in advance. However, with all of its wider triumphs, the Belfast History Project remains a social enterprise, whose key aim is to give back to the community. Local tours and events still run regularly, such as the highly successful historical photographic exhibiton, which recently appeared in the New Lodge – and, as Joe explained, “It’s all about education”.“If we get people into history we can get them into education and guide them along their own path,” he said.“For example, we had a group of kids studying the history of the New Lodge, which grew to Belfast, Ireland and then Europe. They might be kids at the time, and they’ll mess about, but about tenyears later they’ll come back to us and say ‘That was the best project I was ever part of’ and that gives us a buzz.”Joe continued: “I remember years ago that the Barrack area in the New Lodge was just called the Barrack, but younger people didn’t know why it was called that. If you ask them now they’ll tell you it’s because there used to be an army barracks there.“Whenever you do a photographic exhibition and people are learning about their own area, then that’s the start of an educational journey.“As we always say, there is no more fruitful form of education than to raise the interest of people in their own surroundings.“Once you do that it can open up countless other opportunities.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"priceless 1916 artefacts to go on show at opening of new james","story":"AN ORIGINAL  Proclamation along with the printing blocks used to create the document are among the historically invaluable artacts to go on display for the first time ever together when Áras Uí Chonghaile opens its doors next month. The Gaeltacht Quarter-based £. million three-storey building is set to welcome tourists and visitors from Saturday, April  when the centre opens to offer an interactive exhibition, study area, a fascinating library of Connolly’s writings, café and conference facility. The opening of Áras Uí Chonghaile comes three years after a statue of James Connolly was unveiled outside the Falls Community Council to commemorate the th year of the Easter Rising. The bronze statue was unveiled by a great-grandson of the  hero, James Connolly Heron, who described West Belfast as Connolly’s “spiritual home”.The ambitious project, led by Fáilte Feirste Thiar, will host a pageant parade on April , Good Friday, and will leave from Conway Mill, a site where James Connolly organised mill workers during the time he made West Belfast his home. “Aras Uí Chonghaile is designed to celebrate everything James Connolly contributed to Belfast, Ireland and beyond,” explained Fáilte Feirste Director Harry Connolly. “There are five core elements to the centre, starting with the ground floor, world-class visitor exhibition. The first floor of the centre will house the Connolly Library and will consist of the world’s finest collection of writings including books we have secured from when James Connolly spent his time in Kilmainham Gaol. The fourth element of the centre will be an event and conference space, with all the first class facilities you would expect.”Harry told the Andersonstown News that a year-long events programme has also been planned with folk sessions, film club meetings held once a month in conjunction with Sean Murray’s Respect film company, and a series of seminars and lectures.“We are also delighted to announce that Hatch Café will take up residence in the centre as our hospitality partners and will be open to the public,” he said. Áras Uí Chonghaile centre manger Séanna Walsh spoke of how the centre will host a programme of events that will try to emphasise that “It’s not just about Connolly the Irish rebel, it’s as much about Connolly the trade unionist, the guy who organised the mill workers in Conway Street, the guy who went to the States and organised several trade unions there, who all take their lineage right back that far.” Séanna continued: “There will be a major educational element to the centre, we want schools, colleges, universities coming to see the project.“It’s ground-breaking the things we will have on display for the first time: an original Proclamation and also a half Proclamation which was actually produced by the British to use in evidence during the court martial.“Having the seven signatories at the bottom was all they needed, those along with the original printing blocks will be displayed for the first time ever together. “At the end of the day, the centre has to be Connolly in the round. Not the one-dimensional Connolly – the Irish rebel. It’s important to the legacy of the man this centre is seen as a resource by the trade unions right across the island.”Harry said that there is no doubt Áras Uí Chonghaile will become a key part of the city’s tourism trail. “We want to thank our funders Belfast City Council and the wide range of sponsoring trade unions from the States that have pledged and delivered key financial resources which haveallowed the centre to become a reality.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alevel northern ireland school league table","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This will inevitably mean that some people will have to travel a bit further for their day surgery, but we will achieve signicant and sustainable reductions in the waiting times for the procedures.\"Previous work suggests service users accept this trade off.\"Tom Black of the British Medical Association Northern Ireland welcomed the plans, stating they were \"almost inevitable\" as there has been no positive change to waiting list times over the last year.\"Hopefully these plans will be developed in consultation with our members, and will make a real dference in tackling the pressure on acute services and address waiting times for patients,\" he added.\"We know our members are frustrated when procedures are cancelled and their patients are let down, with this reorganisation treatment will be better planned and managed and this can only have a positive effect for everyone.\"The SDLPs health spokesperson, Mark H Durkan, said: \"As these new centres move to specialise in specic areas through an elective care pathway in line with the Bengoa report, other locations will be free to provide the best treatment in other specic areas, should it be orthopaedics or dermatology for example.\"Whilst these new changes mean that patients may have to travel further to receive treatment, it will nonetheless signicantly reduce waiting times and allow for specialists to move through waiting lists at a much faster pace.\""},{"url":null,"title":"malachi odoherty our elected representatives have to take the rough with the smooth after embarrassing quotations spring up all over ni","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No one in public le, whether in journalism, the creative arts or politics, has ever been spared it..pushSo those who say that the current Led By Donkeys billboard campaign is unkind or unwarranted, as Lembit Opik argued on the Nolan Show, are taking a novel and, to my mind, bizarre position.The campaign selects the statements of politicians and recreates them in the format of tweets on huge posters in town centres. The targets include Karen Bradley, our unfortunate Secretary of State, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Theresa May and more to come.I hope.For nothing lts the spirits more in dull political times than for the earnest failures to be held up to public ridicule.In this campaign, the criticism is unusual for a magnicent piece of public satire.Usually satire exaggerates the foibles and absurdities of the targets. Led By Donkeys simply restates them in the words of the politicians themselves.David Cameron really did say that the choice available to us was strong and stable government or the sort of chaos Ed Milliband would bring.And thats funny because Cameron excelled himself in the degree of chaos that could be triggered by a single decision.Political le in Westminster, within the parties, between the parties and between the Government and its partner governments in the European Union, is a shambles. No one knows how the conundrum is to be resolved and how the choice that Cameron offered us is to be realised. We voted on whether to stay in the European Union or to leave it on the assumption that leaving was a realistic prospect.Yet political le is at a halt and the media are distracted by the hand-wringing and head-scratching over how the leave decision that was voted for could actually be delivered.Youd think a leader who offered stability over chaos would have thought that through.Yet he could hardly have done more damage to Parliament, democracy and international relations short of declaring war on France or the Irish Republic.Usually politicians do not make it so easy to ridicule them.Nigel Farage is a twitter joke this week as drones follow his Leave March trying to find him at the head of it, or even at the back of it. And tweeters relish the fantastic buffoonery of the man, the self-inflicted humiliation of summoning the people to his cause and not being there to lead them.Karen Bradley gets quoted saying that she hadnt realised that unionists dont vote for nationalists. Hilarious. But she did say it.In the usual tradition of satire, cartoonists and the sketch writers amply the characteristics or the positions of those they invite us to laugh at.So Spitting Image depicted former Labour deputy leader Roy Hattersley spitting at his audiences. This was deeply unkind. The mans lisp was hardly a personal failing. Hattersley himself was one of the most intelligent and humane politicians we have had, perhaps the last in a generation that produced people who had a compassionate imagination informed by a real education, before the wide boys and the chancers came in.Ken Clarke strikes me as one of that type, somebody you could have a conversation with.David Steele, a co-founder of the Liberal Democratic Party, was always depicted as sitting in the top pocket of David Owen, a slight not only on his apparent secondary position but also on his size. Tony Blair has been depicted by Steve Bell, thecartoonist, with a dead staring eye. John Major was always represented as wearing Y-front underpants over his trousers.Compared to this kind of humour, merely reminding us of the daft and incongruous things that people said amounts almost to respect.My fear is that we dont have enough of this scoffing at our politicians.The viewers and listeners are left to provide it themselves. When Karen Bradley said that killings by soldiers were not crimes, the BBC responded by inviting that old criminal, Sinn Feins Gerry Kelly, onto Evening Extra.If you cant find something to scoff at in a gunman being given a  to sneer at the justication of murder, the very art in which he himself excels, then you are a dull person indeed.Seamus McKee asked Kellykillings by the IRA had been crimes and Kelly conceded after much evasion that they had been against the law of the land at the time.The hoots of derision in thousands of homes and cars passed unheard by the audience.There are arguments which are so bad and so immorally grounded that they arent worth being engaged with rationally. The only thing an insult to your intelligence warrants is an insult in .But there is a genuine feeling abroad that the media dont have the stomach for really tearing down the humbug and hokum of a Gerry Kelly.The danger is always that the argument will get tangled up in whataboutery and other distractions.So the job of ripping into republican smugness falls to the blogger and the commentator. Shane Paul ODoherty, a former bomber himself, provides the most trenchant criticism of the IRA in any forum today. He is scathing and uncompromising and goes so far as to outrage readers by posting photographs of dead bodies, of people shot and dumped as informers on the border. He is pounding away at the Provos, week after week, reminding us of the hypocrisy of those who justied murder while presenting themselves as concerned with equality and human rights.And what better target might we have today than Ian Paisley  Should he not have a travel programme Websites like Ulster Fry, Waterford Whispers, Tyrone Tribulations, LAD and a host of other creative sneerers are circulating parodies of Paisley, Arlene Foster and others, entertaining us and catering for a public appetite for pillorying those who have let us down.Is this cruel Yes, often it is, butit is genuinely funny, thats okay.In Northern Ireland, scoffing is the due riposte of genuine cynicism in a political culture which privileges fanaticism, preening and self regard, which takes the most extreme exponents of deadlock, the absolvers of murder, places them at the centre, and attempts to put them in charge.If the people sidelined by the elevation of bigotry and lies arent entitled to laugh, then they have nothing left but their anger, and we maybe dont want to see that.

But shed more or less got herself back on track ... which was why it didnt make sense for her to cross the road and go onto the pier...\"Struggling to find words to convey the tsunami of grief that has engulfed her close-knit family over the past few days, Rachel said its been very dficult to tell anyone about Ruths death.\"Im in a bit of denial and shock,\" she said.\"I had to tell our seven-year-old son Louis what had happened because I was so upset but I cant tell our other son Oscaras hes too young.\"We cant get our heads around it so we cant really expect them to understand ... and it was absolutely heartbreaking for James to have to tell their children.\"She said their parents, Geraldine Worthington and Malachy Maguire, who lives in London, are also devastated and shocked - but so very grateful to everyone who helped in the search.\"In some way it probably helps that we found her,\" Rachel said. \"At least were not left with the uncertainty of wonderingsomebody took her. Initially mum was worried that a car had hit her. At least now theres some sort of closure in that they found her.\"Following news of her devastating death it emerged that Ruth, who was an underage coach at Bryansford GAC, was part of a triple tragedy to strike the club over the St Patricks bank holiday weekend.Two former players and friends, Shane McAnallen and Martin Patterson, who were both in their s, were killed in a car crash near Carlingford in the early hours of Monday morning.SDLP councillor Mark Murin, chair of Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, said it was a time of unspeakable grief in the Newcastle area and he offered his condolences to all three families.Mr Murin added that Ruth, who was also a casual leisure attendant in the Newcastle Centre, was \"pleasant-natured, intuitive and hard-working\" and was \"popular with colleagues and customers alike.\"Describing Ruth as a home bird, Rachel said a night out \"wasnt really her thing\" because her le revolved around taking her kids to ious classes.\"Ruth didnt really drink. She had tea on her th birthday.\"This was a rare occasion when she was having a few drinks. Its not her scene. Shes never been one for going out. She was very much a family girl.\"Rachel added: \"I honestly dont know what happened. I dont think the gardai know either ... and I dont think it would be fair on Ruth to speculate.\"But now, after the terrible tragedy that unfolded during Ruths friends hen, instead of looking forward to her beloved sisters wedding, Rachel finds herself preparing for her funeral this weekend.It will leave her mothers residence in Ligoniel Place, Belfast on Saturday at .am to arrive at St Vincent de Paul Church for am Requiem Mass, then on to Carnmoney Cemetery for committal at am.\"She was getting married on August . Everything was ready she was very organised,\" Rachel said. \"I was going to be maid of honour. All the children - hers, mine and Ryans little girl Nyla- were going to be flower boys and girls. There were  guests.\"She added: \"We are going to let her wear her wedding dress in the coffin.\"Through tears, Rachel said Ruth was \"very family-focused, bubbly, funny, and level-headed\", adding that \"even though she was the baby of the family she was the sensible one of the four of us\".\"She was very determined and even with three kids she was always studying and trying to progress in work,\" she said. \"She was inspirational because she was such a brilliant mum.\"Were a very close family but her and I were particularly close, especially with the children. The cousins did a lot together. We were best friends and sisters. We talked every day.\"Rachel said its \"so dficult not understanding why she went across to the water\".\"The coming months were going to be so exciting ... I dont get it,\" she added. \"The hardest part for all of us is that shes not here.\"But the sister bond is so special ... and I dont have a sister anymore.\""},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar eu must ensure brexit does not become rolling cliffedge","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Martin said MPs had a choice whether they want “a Brexit of some sort” or the potential of no-deal Brexit because he said there was a likelihood that an extension could be a long one."},{"url":null,"title":"smacking ban was lightbulb moment in ireland says former senator","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is a suggestion that it results in increased reporting.“The bill is a removal of a statutory defence of justiable assault.

plannersrsquo recommendation to refuse permission to develop Northern Irelandrsquos first woodland graveyard outside Downpatrick.The decision to allow those behind the controversial proposal for a -acre site at Loughmoney more time to provide additional information was taken at last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilsrsquo Planning Committee.Plans for the graveyard, which has split public opinion, were unveiled in September  by Down to Earth Ltd, which hosted a series of public consultation meetings to outline the detail of its proposal.Those behind the lsquogreen graveyardrsquo project, which would be sited off the Ballyculter Road and contain parking provision for  cars, say they are confident that the proposal would have a low environmental impact and offer an alternative to those seeking an environmentally-friendly approach to burial.They argue there are no designations that would preclude a development of this nature and that the proposal will enhance the location by creating and enhancing shared space, supporting good design and improving the built and natural environment.Supporters of the project also contend that the project will ldquopreserve restore and enhance ecosystems, turning an arable field into a nature reserve.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed they had representations in support and opposition to the proposal, with the planned burial site having no headstones, with all burials recorded on a map.Signicantly, planners confirmed that while there can be no objections in principle to the proposal, those behind the project had not provided the requested additional information.They revealed that while extra time was allowed to comply with the request, no further extension was being afforded with the recommendation to refuse the application now being made.Planners added: ldquoWhile it is considered that the proposal will not create any unacceptable visual or residential impact due to its nature, it is considered further information is required for the consultees which also encompasses a number of concerns raised from interested parties.Planners confirmed Environment and Rivers Agencies are among those who still require further information to enable them to fully assess the planning application and provide detailed comment.Planners had described the information they required as ldquocrucial and pertinent to the application and that it was most unfortunate that it has not been provided.They said while there may be no objection in principle to the proposal ldquoit

Since then Exploris curator Peter Williams has kept a watchful eye over the  month-old old turtle.Mr Williams said: ldquoThe loggerhead turtle arrived at Exploris Aquarium in a critical condition from a beach near Rosbeg, Co Donegal.ldquoSince then we have been working tirelessly to slowly raise the turtlersquos temperature by a couple of degrees every day. Our veterinary team also decided to administer a course of antibiotics as an increase in temperature heightened the risk of a secondary infection setting in.He added: ldquoI am now happy to report that JC is making slow but great progress and is feeding well on a iety of fish and invertebrates. He is also receiving a gelatin diet, full of calcium, vitamins and minerals, which is important for the development of his shell.ldquoAs JC has taken well to rehabilitation we have decided that it is best for him to be moved to a larger space as he will have more room to swim and e.ldquoLuckily he has responded well to treatment and is currently settling in to his new home where visitors to the aquarium will be able to get a glimpse of the vulnerable species as he continues to recover.The future is looking bright for JC as the team at Exploris will continue to monitor his weight over the coming months. They plan to release him back to his natural environment when he has fully recovered.Loggerhead turtles like JC can live to about  years of age in the wild and usually reach about three feet in shell .Mr Williams says the ultimate goal is to release the reptile back into the wild in warmer waters.This is not the first time Exploris has tried to nurse a lost loggerhead turtle back to health.In January , another loggerhead was found washed up on a Co Donegal beach and was also taken to Exploris suffering from hypothermia.Staff named that male turtle Columba, but sadly it died a short time later, making JCrsquos recovery all the more remarkable..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McKinstry is on the mark at Jimmy’s 10  ","story":"THE Beast from the East was well and truly caged this year as the day dawned bright and sunny, although with a noticeable frosty nip to awaken unsuspecting toes and fingers of the small army of East Down clubmen and their cons which descended on the sleeping streets of the county town on Jimmyrsquos Ten Sunday.Their mission was to display the necessary Kilometre markers and warning signs around the soon to be crowded route.Time was of the essence as upwards of , runners and walkers had signed up for the biggest participation sporting event in the district and with the start brought forward to am, to facilitate the festival paradersquos new start time of pm, it was going to be a tight run affair to have all in place before the runners took over.But, as ever, the super team managed it with a bit to spare.It should be pointed out that at am the pathway at the Quoile was water free.

There will also be a dedicated parking area for coaches.Original plans for the new hotel described finishing the exterior of the building in stone slate, with the accommodation centred around a landscaped courtyard. The proposed hotel development also includes plans to upgrade the Inch Abbey Road junction with the Belfast Road.Lidl submitted plans to secure outline planning permission to redevelop the . acre Shanslieve Drive site in January last year.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed that none of the statutory consultees including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, had lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners have insisted that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and that there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which could accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.The supermarket giant says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Prenter goals just the ticket  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Grammar School produced a sizzling display to get the better of a resolute Cathair Dhoire side in a nailbiting showdown at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Monday.The Red High had to show great fortitude and tenacity in one of the most exciting and entertaining MacLarnon Cup finals in years as the Derry amalgamation threatened to ruin St Patrickrsquos day.The Downpatrick lads werenrsquot found wanting when the chips were down and two goals from man of the match Tim Prenter mdash one in each half mdash was the main dference between the sides.Prenter was a deserved recipient of the award as he continually stalked the Cathair Dhoire defence at every opportunity and had them chasing shadows every time he went near the ball.Loughinislandrsquos Brandon Boyd opened the scoring for the Red High after only  seconds. Club mate Peter McMullan fielded the resultant kick out and released Ronan Connor to make it - to - after less than a minutersquos play.However, Cathair Dhoire started pushing up on the Red High kick-outs and this proved an effective tactic with scores flowing from Cahir McMonagle, Fergal Mortimerand Ben McCarronto take a - to - lead after just five minutes of free-flowing football.It could have been even worse for St Patrickrsquos as Cathair Dhoire wasted two excellent goal chances with superb defending from Bryansfordrsquos Jack Harbinson denying McCarron with a timely block.The Red High started gaining possession in and around the middle of the park, but they definitely missed the ball winning ability of Saulrsquos Ruairi OrsquoHare in this sector, although he did start at full forward.OrsquoHare picked up an injury while playing for the Northern Ireland U- team in a Centenary Shield game against Wales on Thursday night, but his switch to leading his sidersquos attack worked a treat.With seven minutes of non-stop football gone Prenter, a senior county hurler, left three defenders trailing in his wake as he cut through the Cathair Dhoire cover before drilling the ball low and hard into the bottom corner of the net.Not a bad goal considering there was absolutely nothing on when the Downpatrick player received the ball out on the left flank.The Red High now had a grip on the game and OrsquoHare plundered the next five points for his side, two from frees, but Cathair Dhoire kept in touch with two points from McCarron, leaving the Downpatrick school with a - to - lead after  minutes.The Derry amalgamation sensed blood and towering midfielder Oran McGrath plucked the ball out of the air and ended a bustling run with an improvised finish to the net.Cathair Dhoire were far from finished and unanswered points from McCarron, McMonagle and Mortimer had the sides level after  minutes with all to play for.It could have been curtains for the Red High at this stage, but lsquokeeper Eoin Maginn saved his sidersquos bacon with two wonderful saves.Ruairi Quinn edged the Red High back in front just minutes after being introduced and the impressive OrsquoHare made it a - to - game  minutes.Prenter then finished Cathair Dhoire off with a second sensational goal. McMullan converted a late free after OrsquoHare had been sent off and McCarron grabbed the last score of the game for a battling Derry side.St Patrickrsquos: E Maginn, J Harbinson, E Rooney, L Guiness, P McMullan, R Murphy, B Boyd , C Watson, R OrsquoHare , T Smyth , O Cunningham, N Laverty, T Prenter , R Connor , T Savage.

QUB has since suspended links with UTC.The letter which informed him of his dismissal highlighted his comments to BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback in June  after PCI’s decision to cut official links with the Church of Scotland over the issue of same sex relationships.He was commenting after a controversial vote by church leaders from across Ireland in June, which affirmed that nobody in a same sex relationship could be a full member of the church.The letter to Mr Kirkpatrick, seen and reported by the BBC, said: “Your contribution to the Talkback programme on  June  brought Union Theological College and by association, your employer, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland into disrepute.“Your comments on the Talkback programme had a signicant and material adverse impact on PCI’s relationship with Queen’s University Belfast and caused hurt and damage to the faculty’s relationship and cohesion.”The letter said he had taken part in the Talkback programme “at a time when there was considerable media comment, mostly of an adverse nature, about your employer, the Presbyterian Church”.It said that he had failed to gain the church’s approval for taking part and that his comments were “unacceptable”.“You stated that you would be ‘horried’, using that word twice,a student at Union Theological College was taught that a same-sex, sexually active relationship was sinful, knowing full well that was the doctrinal position of your employer,” the BBC reported.It also said that when another guest had questioned QUB’s link to UTC, hemade no attempt to defend the college’s reputation.The letter said that Prof Kirkpatrick’s comments had “contributed signicantly to a fracturing of the relationship between your employer and Queen’s University Belfast”.The disciplinary  found that his participation and what he said on-air amounted to gross misconduct and left them with no alternative but to dismiss him.One in five school staff assualted once a week in Northern Ireland Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Another four charges related to offences including entering UTC and attending a Queen’s graduation ceremony after he had been suspended, as well as unauthorised access to the church’s IT systems.These constituted misconduct and would have led to one ‘first’ and three ‘final’ written warnings, the  found.UTC said it could not comment as the case was “an employment matter which is still subject to appeal”.A QUB spokeswoman said it has no role in the staffing arrangements at UTC and is not in a position to comment on specic cases. Prof Kirkpatrick offered no comment to the BBC.Last June Prof Kirkpatrick told BBC Talkback that lecturers at UTC have got to “try and create a neutral environment, and of course I would be heartbrokenanyone turned around and said ‘Kirkpatrick, you have been bigoted against Catholic students or gay students or whatever’.”He said of his students: “I don’t even ask religious background. I don’t ask anything, obviously, about someone’s sexual leanings or anything or like that.”Asked by presenter William Crawley what would happena gay student at UTC was offered “only one view” that a “same-sex sexually active relationship is sinful”, Professor Kirkpatrick replied: “I would be horriedthey would be getting that in our college. And it is of course not consistent with the university as near as possible we uphold everything that the university stands for, our ersity, inclusiveness, equality - all of those things. That is what adds to the mix. I would be horriedthat was the case.”Mr Crawley said today on BBC Talkback that he had a document from the Presbyterian church which lays out the ways they are developing a task group the decision making and dissent. He said it is tasked with drawing up a report on Presbyterian decision making and the place of dissent, and that the report will go first to the general council and then the general assembly of the church.A range of commentators on BBC Talkback expressed deep disappointment yesterday with the Presbyterian Church’s decision to dismiss Professor Laurence Kirkpatrick.Alliance MLA David Ford, who had previously clashed with the church after voicing a more liberal position on same sex relationships, told Talkback he is now “an elder without charge” as a result of that controversy.He said: “If find it very surprising that anything he said... was anything beyond the expression of his inidual conscience as he, a minister of the church, is entitled to do as any minister or elder is entitled to do. They are bound by the decisions of the General Assembly but they have freedom of conscience to express their views. And I find it very sad that Laurence Kirkpatrick has faced disciplinary action to the point of losing his job.”Presbyterian minister Rev Cheryl Mebhan said there is now “a terrible chill factor” but that it is “really important that we allow there not to be a chill factor that stops us engaging fully in public debate” adding that the Presbyterian Church should be “the first place to be able to express erse opinions and to hold dference well”. She added: “I am deeply disappointed that this has happened. I am really surprised that the outcome has been given as based primarily on what Laurence Kirkpatrick said on the radio. I am horried that would be the main reason why somebody would lose their job.”Gavin Boyd of the Rainbow Project said: “I think it is just a really sad chapter in the story of the presbyterian church in Ireland which I think has got a noble and honourable tradition of dissent and radical thought and inidual conscience.” He added that “over the past couple of years there has been a really depressing chilling hardening of views within the church”.try catch  TrendingGreenvale Hotel owner Michael McElhatton: Police have blackened my name over  drugs claimHotel owner arrested over St

She also urged a duty of candour and acceptance of dference.It is hard to shake hands with a closed fistTerry WrightHowever, in an open letter to Ms McDonald, Mr Wright said her endorsement of the banner’s message was contradictory to her stated vision for a ‘new Ireland’ of equals, and “lends to the view that your presence and association with the sentiment expressed was either misjudged and misguided, or your presentation at QUB is best seen as expedient rhetoric designed to mask strategic and political intentions that are worrying in their implications”.“You will understand the clear contradictions as viewed from the side-lines and the injury that results.”Mr Wright added: “To embrace a mantra of exclusivity, which implies that this is worthy of support, undermines trust and renders problematic any attempt at the reconciliation which civic unionism promotes. It is hard to shake hands with a closed fist.“I can envisage no situation wherein civic unionists would denigrate an inidual’s identity or call for anyone to leave their home and get out of Ireland, north or south. I am disappointed to find that Sinn Fein under your leadership is not at the same point.”The New York parade banner also alienated a number of Irish nationalists who had joined Sinn Fein in a show of unity at Belfast’s Waterfront Hall in January. Echoing the sentiments of Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney – who described the banner as “offensive” and “isive” – political commentator David McCann said the message was “completely contrary to everything that we discussed at that conference”.Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey, who also addressed the Waterfront ‘Beyond Brexit’ event, said the banner “calls into question her genuine commitment to equality and rights”.Greenvale Hotel owner Michael McElhatton: Police have blackened my name over  drugs claim Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF |

leader’s critics.He tweeted: “If – after all of the events of this week – your ire is directed at an Irish republican standing behind an historical anti-colonial banner in America then you’ve really got to step away from social media for a few days and enjoy the holiday.”try catch  TrendingGreenvale Hotel owner Michael McElhatton: Police have blackened my name over  drugs claimHotel owner

You will agree that you were heard with respect and courtesy. As an inclusive and civic unionist, it is what I endorse and seek to promote. If we are to address our many problems it is the least that we can ask of each other.In the course of your talk you referred to the need for unionism, which is not exclusively but largely representative of iniduals from Anglo and Ulster  Scotch Irish backgrounds, to engage with nationalists and republicans to build a ‘new Ireland ‘where unionists could feel included and confident that their rights and rich mosaic of identity, culture and heritage will be afforded respect and recognition.Your recent political actions in New York where you chose to walk with an offensive banner calling for ‘England to get out of Ireland’ lends to the view that your presence and association with the sentiment expressed was either misjudged and misguided or your presentation at QUB is best seen as expedient rhetoric designed to mask strategic and political intentions that are worrying in their implications. You will understand the clear contradictions as viewed from the side-lines and the injury that results.Letter to the editorWithin the audience at Queen’s University were gathered iniduals, like me, who are genetically and culturally from Ulster Scots-Irish or Anglo- Irish background. In regard to the latter they are the embodiment of a culture and heritage which you seem to see as unwelcome. You would do well to remember that there is historically, a thin line between ‘England out’ and ‘English out.’ The history of de-Anglicisation in Ireland is peppered with the legacy of the deliberate targeting of the Anglo-Irish community and identity well beyond the ‘Big House’ and the Ascendancy. More recent history evidences similar traits especially in Northern Ireland where Englishness was subsumed under an umbrella of ‘Britishness.’ To embrace a mantra of exclusivity which implies that this is worthy of support undermines trust and renders problematic any attempt at the reconciliation which civic unionism promotes. It is hard to shake hands with a closed fist. As informed by extensive discussion with other civic unionists, I believe that they are committed to and will continue to work towards building an inclusive community for everyone regardless of identity, culture, gender, faith and heritage. I can envisage no situation wherein civic unionists would denigrate an inidual’s identity or call for anyone to leave their home and get out of Ireland, North or South.I am disappointed to find that Sinn Fein under your leadership is not at the same point.Yours sincerely,Terry Wright, LondonderryJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Brexit: Sammy Wilson says DUP wonrsquot be bribed on Theresa Mayrsquos lsquotoxicrsquo dealThe DUP won#t be backing the prime minister#s #toxic# Brexit deal and the party has not been offered a financial incentive to do so, Sammy Wilson has said.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only. However, in the mid s the decision was taken to also accept girls and become a coeducational school.Westbourne was first established in Penarth in  as Westbourne House Preparatory School for Boys, and has kept the choice for children to board.A number of international students attend the school, and they often board with families from the area ndash usually Westbourne alumni themselves. More than  dferent nationalities take the opportunity to board in the area.Westbourne are rightly proud of this international aspect.ldquoEveryone here mixes in together, said Marie de Tito Mount, the schoolrsquos director of marketing. ldquoWe have children studying from Russia, China, the US, Poland, India, and theyrsquore all friends.ldquoTherersquos no cliques or groups, and wersquore proud of the international aspect this is giving our children.ldquoWe feel like wersquore making them citizens of the world.Ranked st in Wales by The Sunday Times Schools Guide and st in the UK by The DailyLeague Tables,  per cent of Westbourne graduates go to Russell Group universities or equivalently elite international institutions.The school points to two factors for this ndash the small number of pupils, and the highly trained staff.With a class size of just eight students per teacher on average, every student gets full and unided attention.The children clearly thrive from this, building confidence and passion for their work.In reception, there was a palpable excitement to show off their handmade vegetable dolls.A Year Five jumped at the chance to read out her ndash impressively well-written ndash poem.In the senior school, a young man attacked a maths problem on a board with gusto. He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too. More than  per cent of teachers at Westbourne have a PhD or masters and more than  per cent have taught internationally.Westbourne School has cultivated a warm and highly supportive culture one in which students and teachers truly support each other.For more information, visit:https:www.westbourneschool Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

Our young people need support, and we need to be looking out for each other at times like this.“With this in mind I have decided to open an online book of condolence to allow the public and especially young people who were there to leave a message of sympathy.“This may only be a small gesture but may provide an outlet for our young people to express their feelings, and perhaps provide some comfort in the months ahead for the families of those who lost their lives.”The book of condolence can be found at www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk condolencePrayers for local family of Greenvale victim

QUB has since suspended links with UTC.The letter which informed him of his dismissal highlighted his comments to BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback in June  after PCI’s decision to cut official links with the Church of Scotland over the issue of same sex relationships.He was commenting after a controversial vote by church leaders from across Ireland in June, which affirmed that nobody in a same sex relationship could be a full member of the church.The letter to Mr Kirkpatrick, seen and reported by the BBC, said: “Your contribution to the Talkback programme on  June  brought Union Theological College and by association, your employer, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland into disrepute.“Your comments on the Talkback programme had a signicant and material adverse impact on PCI’s relationship with Queen’s University Belfast and caused hurt and damage to the faculty’s relationship and cohesion.”The letter said he had taken part in the Talkback programme “at a time when there was considerable media comment, mostly of an adverse nature, about your employer, the Presbyterian Church”.It said that he had failed to gain the church’s approval for taking part and that his comments were “unacceptable”.“You stated that you would be ‘horried’, using that word twice,a student at Union Theological College was taught that a same-sex, sexually active relationship was sinful, knowing full well that was the doctrinal position of your employer,” the BBC reported.It also said that when another guest had questioned QUB’s link to UTC, hemade no attempt to defend the college’s reputation.The letter said that Prof Kirkpatrick’s comments had “contributed signicantly to a fracturing of the relationship between your employer and Queen’s University Belfast”.The disciplinary  found that his participation and what he said on-air amounted to gross misconduct and left them with no alternative but to dismiss him.DUP calls for a halt to school consultation Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Another four charges related to offences including entering UTC and attending a Queen’s graduation ceremony after he had been suspended, as well as unauthorised access to the church’s IT systems.These constituted misconduct and would have led to one ‘first’ and three ‘final’ written warnings, the  found.UTC said it could not comment as the case was “an employment matter which is still subject to appeal”.A QUB spokeswoman said it has no role in the staffing arrangements at UTC and is not in a position to comment on specic cases. Prof Kirkpatrick offered no comment to the BBC.Last June Prof Kirkpatrick told BBC Talkback that lecturers at UTC have got to “try and create a neutral environment, and of course I would be heartbrokenanyone turned around and said ‘Kirkpatrick, you have been bigoted against Catholic students or gay students or whatever’.”He said of his students: “I don’t even ask religious background. I don’t ask anything, obviously, about someone’s sexual leanings or anything or like that.”Asked by presenter William Crawley what would happena gay student at UTC was offered “only one view” that a “same-sex sexually active relationship is sinful”, Professor Kirkpatrick replied: “I would be horriedthey would be getting that in our college. And it is of course not consistent with the university as near as possible we uphold everything that the university stands for, our ersity, inclusiveness, equality - all of those things. That is what adds to the mix. I would be horriedthat was the case.”Mr Crawley said today on BBC Talkback that he had a document from the Presbyterian church which lays out the ways they are developing a task group the decision making and dissent. He said it is tasked with drawing up a report on Presbyterian decision making and the place of dissent, and that the report will go first to the general council and then the general assembly of the church.A range of commentators on BBC Talkback expressed deep disappointment yesterday with the Presbyterian Church’s decision to dismiss Professor Laurence Kirkpatrick.Alliance MLA David Ford, who had previously clashed with the church after voicing a more liberal position on same sex relationships, told Talkback he is now “an elder without charge” as a result of that controversy.He said: “If find it very surprising that anything he said... was anything beyond the expression of his inidual conscience as he, a minister of the church, is entitled to do as any minister or elder is entitled to do. They are bound by the decisions of the General Assembly but they have freedom of conscience to express their views. And I find it very sad that Laurence Kirkpatrick has faced disciplinary action to the point of losing his job.”Presbyterian minister Rev Cheryl Mebhan said there is now “a terrible chill factor” but that it is “really important that we allow there not to be a chill factor that stops us engaging fully in public debate” adding that the Presbyterian Church should be “the first place to be able to express erse opinions and to hold dference well”. She added: “I am deeply disappointed that this has happened. I am really surprised that the outcome has been given as based primarily on what Laurence Kirkpatrick said on the radio. I am horried that would be the main reason why somebody would lose their job.”Gavin Boyd of the Rainbow Project said: “I think it is just a really sad chapter in the story of the presbyterian church in Ireland which I think has got a noble and honourable tradition of dissent and radical thought and inidual conscience.” He added that “over the past couple of years there has been a really depressing chilling hardening of views within the church”.try catch  TrendingSex case man still to tell employerCall for drivers to take care as wall collapsed onto roadPrayers for local family of

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/west.jpg","title":"major ni firms in eleventh hour westminster plea to avoid no deal brexit","story":"Posted on Friday March  by John Mulgrew More than  of Northern Ireland’s biggest businesses – employing tens of thousands of workers here – have written to MPs in an eleventh hour plea to avoid a ‘no deal’ Brexit.  As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to. In the event of a no deal Brexit, motorists in Northern Ireland travelling to the Republic of Ireland will need a Green Card as proof of insurance. There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation. There is also information at www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit along with links to further information for businesses, employers and EU citizens, while information on the Common Travel Areacan be found at https:www.gov.uk government publications common-travel-area-guidance You might not have heard about the CTA before, but it gives British and Irish citizens agreed rights and privileges in both jurisdictions. The CTA is not based on EU membership and is a long standing arrangements based on domestic legislation and agreements between the UK and Irish governments and deals with a range of issues. www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit will be updated as and when new information becomes clear and available.
