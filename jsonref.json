But as more houses slouch into the sea, locals accuse the council of dragging its feet on a seawall while experts say the land should never have been built onby  Naaman Zhou. Photographs by  Carly EarlThe tide isn’t usually this high, Robert Hill says. “There is normally 150 metres of beach out the front here,” he says, pointing down past the flowers and the coastal scrub. “That’s all beach all the way down.”Today, the water is lapping at the base, not of Hill’s house, but of his neighbour’s. Overhead, a crane dips back and forth, lifting concrete blocks 20m up into the air, laying them gently in front of his neighbour Peter’s beachfront place – a protective wall for where the verandah has snapped and the lawn has sunk into the water.At Wamberal Beach, 90km north of Sydney on the New South Wales Central Coast, the houses are slouching into the sea.Last Friday night it stormed. The residents of Ocean View Drive woke to find the land had slid out from under them. The swell had grown and grown and, in the words of resident Margaret Brice, “it just comes up and bashes the dune and undermines it”.Standing on his deck in the sun in his old rugby jersey, Hill, 81, has spent more than 40 years watching the sea come in.The stairs to his house come up straight from the beach, subided in a coastal garden: saltbush, hard little coastal flowers and huge striped tongues of sansevieria. “The worst has been at the foot there,” he says. “But that was many years ago. Back in the 70s.”Storms and erosion at Wamberal are not new. Dr Tayanah O’Donnell from the Australian National University says that for the beachfront (a “known high-risk location”) “there will come a time when people will have to accept that they can no longer live there”.“It has been happening since back in the 1970s and it is almost as regular as every four or five years, there is a major event,” Hill says. “What happens in a really bad storm event is the storms come from the south-east, they come around The Skillion, and they come in like a fishhook. They come in and scour the beach out.”Residents like Hill say the solution is for the council to build a permanent revetment wall – known as a seawall. He rejects the argument that the houses themselves are built too close to the sea. “I don’t think so,” he says. “Not in my view.“The area was subided in the early 1900s, and there have been properties on the beachfront here for over 100 years.”It is bad luck, not risk, that has caused his neighbours’ houses to fall while his stays standing, he tells  Australia. “I’ve just been lucky there is more accumulation of sand in front of me, at the moment,” he says. “On another occasion, they could be fine, and I could be scoured out.” He is pointing out at the sand. “Over the years that has accumulated and it is like money in the bank.”On Monday, the residents of the 18 worst-affected lots were evacuated. Owners along the strip are furious.Chris Rogers, whose house was directly affected, says the council has dragged its feet on the seawall, and even prevented residents from taking other protective action like sandbagging.“It’s because of them that we are here,” he says, as he packs up to evacuate his house. “They have stopped people trying to protect their homes, they have denied DAs.”Margaret Brice lives a few doors down, on the outer limits of what she calls the “green zone”, where it is still safe to stay. The edge of her lawn has a huge crack in it, steel bars stick up from the ground.“It is now illegal to walk on my deck,” she says.Brice says the council had promised as early as 2002 to build the seawall.“In the early 2000s, when I bought this house, it was in the coastal zone’s management plan that they would build a buried rock revetment wall … And that was why you were allowed to build on the beach.”Brice and Rogers say residents have offered to pay for the seawall.“The solution is very simple,” Hill says. “Dig a hole along the front, fill it up full of rocks, and then cover it back with sand. It is not a difficult proposition.”But others, including O’Donnell, say the land should never have been built on in the first place.“Revetment walls are not cheap and environmentally they disturb the natural formation of coastlines. Coastlines are meant to move. A hard structure like a revetment wall can simply make these natural movements occur further along a coastline.”Residents and councils in many other areas around Australia face similar dilemmas. At Stockton Beach, north of Newcastle, which has been repeatedly hit by coastal erosion, the council has attempted to defend the community by bringing in sand to fill voids. The latest plan involves importing 80,000 truckloads of sand at a cost of $52m.In Byron Bay, beachfront property owners have spent two decades in a marathon legal battle with the council over a seawall which the residents want repaired and have offered to pay for, but have been repeatedly knocked back.Similar arguments have been raging for decades at Sydney’s Collaroy Beach, which suffered massive erosion after a 2016 storm. A proposal there for a seawall received massive opposition from surfers and environmentalists because of the impact it would have on the rest of the beach.O’Donnell says the residents at Ocean View Drive may have to walk away at some point. “Climate change will continue to exacerbate weather patterns and coastal events like what we have seen will become more common place. It is a nonsense to build, or rebuild, on soft shorelines equally it is a nonsense for land not to be utilised for its highest and best use at particular points in time.”Local resident Susie, who declined to give her surname, lives three streets back from the beachfront strip.“I’ve lived here all my life, it’s been going on for quite a few years,” she says. “Personally, in 1974, when it happened I think they should have reclaimed the land back then.”She believes the land on the beachfront should be turned into a community area, or if the seawall is built, it should not be fully-funded by the ratepayers.“I think when the owners purchased their properties they would have had to have known that this is an area of erosion, they would have done their investigations,” she says. “It’s like the one in 100-year flood – you can be guaranteed that as much as you think it is not going to happen to you, Murphy’s Law, it will. There is a huge risk you take when you want this lifestyle.“I know some of the residents along here, they are great people, the loveliest people, the most genuine people you can find, and they have worked very hard to afford these beautiful properties, so I really feel for them. But in saying that again, you have got to have known, the possibility of erosion, and this happening, again, was on the cards.“I truly believe council should reclaim the land and make it more of a community area, where the community can enjoy it, everybody can enjoy it, rather than the wealthy few.”Brice and Rogers reject the idea that the wall is just for them.“It’s not just our homes,” Rogers says. “The beach is ruined. My point is – we get another storm? That breaches? All of this is gone.” He points to the main road and the houses behind.“There’s a lot of people saying, ‘Oh yeah, you homeowners, blah blah blah.’ No one can use the beach. If you’re walking your dog, you can’t do it now. If you’re going for a surf, you can’t. If you going for a fish, you can’t. Because they have allowed the beach to be wrecked.”“We’re not silver spoon kids,” Brice says. “It’s not about throwing stones at rich people, saying ‘Too bad, haha, you lost your views.’“This is about protecting the whole of Wamberal. There are hundreds of homes behind us, with very little foundation and much lower level than us. We are sitting on nine metres above sea level. That road is three metres, you do the math, if the dune goes. It’s really scary.”Central Coast Council did not respond to specific questions about the revetment wall, but directed  Australia to information on its website about the wall.Any eventual seawall could cost between $10,000 to more than $30,000 per metre, and would have to take into account the impact on the environment and “the impact on public access and beach amenity”, the council says.“The solution is complex, requires input and agreement from a number of parties, and no funding model has previously been developed to implement the works. An agreed funding model is a central element to delivering a terminal protection seawall structure on Wamberal Beach.”A working group is currently investigating solutions, it says, and “consideration of the impacts of forecast climate change will also be required”.O’Donnell says a wall protecting public assets such as roads and infrastructure is “an appealing option”, but “in my experience and my own research, taxpayers don’t really see it that way – and there is a general community sentiment that those who don’t benefit from the wall should not be paying for it”.Back on Wamberal Beach, Rogers is packing up. He has a place to stay, with a neighbour, who has another house in Sydney. His daughters start school again soon.“I didn’t build too close to the sea,” he says. “We built, we bought and built, if you are allowed to build, you build it efficiently. What the problem is, the coast is eroding, it happens all over the world. And the way to stop that is to build a revetment wall. It’s not us.”Brice says: “We’ve done what we have been allowed to do. We haven’t built illegally. We have done what we have done within Central Coast Council’s usual building plans ... under the proviso that they were going to build a wall.“I nearly purchased a property up here a while back, but it came back that it was in a one in 100 flood zone area, and you know – there are other places you can buy, in other areas, and you can have just as beautiful outlook.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/058ec4c4e8ebdd8be55c99e90792a91c27d8c9a4/0_108_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86f0392a54c0e0a748ab05a5f447f47a","title":"bigger foreign intervention brexit referendum russia rupert murdoch","story":"Putin’s meddling was wrong – but it was dwarfed by the influence of Rupert MurdochBritain is a democracy with heavy caveats. It allows its citizens an equal vote, but not an equal say. Those with wealth gain power and influence – through access to politicians, donations to political parties, lobbying, well-funded thinktanks and ownership of most of the press.“As inequality grows, so does the political influence of the rich,” is how that well-known bastion of socialism the Economist put it a couple of years ago. Yet we are denied a proper debate on how British democracy is subverted by vested interests because it would mean most newspapers – who play a major part in framing the national conversation – having to scrutinise their own role.This week, the long-delayed intelligence and security committee report into alleged Russian interference in British democracy had troubling findings: not least ministers turning an apparent blind eye. Vladimir Putin’s kleptocratic gangster regime should be opposed by anyone with progressive inclinations: for its murderous war in Chechnya, in which tens of thousands perished its state-sanctioned bigotry against LGBTQ people and for its ties with the European far right. That the Conservatives financially benefit from donations linked to Russian oligarchs is itself a concern, as is Britain’s status as a safe haven for dirty money worth about £100bn a year.But the spectre of Russian interference has become a crutch for many liberal centrists. Easier to claim the nefarious hand of Putin is responsible for political events we do not like – from Brexit to Donald Trump – than to ask searching questions about our own dysfunctional democracies. Calls to clamp down on states intervening in each other’s affairs need to be consistent, or risk being hypocritical and self-serving. The United States backed Boris Yeltsin’s presidential campaign in 1996: a Time front page in July 2016 hailed “The secret story of how American advisers helped Yeltsin win”, and the Bill Clinton administration lobbied the International Monetary Fund to provide Yeltsin with a loan to boost his re-election efforts.Richard Dearlove, the former MI6 chief, has publicly regretted that British security services helped Putin win power in 2000. On the eve of that presidential election, Tony Blair praised Putin as a moderniser who was “highly intelligent and with a focused view of what he wants to achieve in Russia”, even as Chechnya was being flattened. Postwar history is littered with examples of western-backed coups and meddling in foreign elections.Of far more relevance was the role of the two largest newspapers in Britain, the Sun – owned by an Australian-born American mogul, if we’re talking of foreign intervention – and the Daily Mail, which forcefully campaigned for Brexit. Not only do they have millions of readers, their front pages play a key role in shaping broadcast news coverage too. And given that immigration played a key role in the referendum, years of inaccurate and inflammatory press reporting on migrants surely had a dramatic impact on the result.As a 2018 academic study found, while the media are not all-powerful, there is “ample evidence that the media can impact on attitude formation, especially (but not exclusively) where the public are dependent on coverage, have weak partisan predispositions, or where reporting is uniform or near-uniform across a range of sources”. Polls routinely find that the public believe benefit fraud and teenage pregnancy is far higher than is the case, and that there are more migrants: undoubtedly this has much to do with exaggerated and misleading reporting.The obsessive focus with Putin robs us of the chance to discuss these issues. After the 2016 defeat, the rational approach by the remain movement would have been to focus on winning over leave voters. Instead, social media helped radicalise some remainers into believing the referendum was illegitimate – and hence that it was a legal rather than a political problem. The menace of Russian intervention helped cement this attitude.That doesn’t mean ignoring possible foreign meddling in democratic processes, here or abroad, and measures must be taken to safeguard elections. But while much time and energy has been expended on debating the role of Russia, there is all too little scrutiny about the far greater crisis of how the wealthy, and their vested interests, interfere in and distort democracy. Until we challenge that the question marks over our own democracy will remain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93c5a21c7bbc07b7e8607c0aa8741ae42ec53097/0_296_4440_2664/master/4440.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=83272b8849314e0f03a641e55f8a94e9","title":"world needs coronavirus vaccine big pharma monopoly astrazeneca patent pandemic","story":"AstraZeneca and others should not own a lucrative patent on a medicine that is needed by poor as well as rich nations• See all our coronavirus coverage• Helen Clark is a former prime minister of New Zealand and Winnie Byanyima is UN undersecretary generalTo bring an end to the pandemic, the world needs a vaccine. Promising early trial results for the vaccine developed by Oxford University suggest we’re inching closer to discovering one.Data published recently in the Lancet shows the Oxford vaccine produced antibodies and T-cells in roughly 1,000 patients. The pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, has been licensed to produce this vaccine by early 2021, which includes an agreement to produce 1 billion doses with the Serum Institute in India for low- and middle-income countries by the end of that year.But this is still a long way from what is needed. To vaccinate everyone, the world needs as many as 7.8bn doses, as quickly as possible. If the successful vaccine requires more than one dose, or must be given annually, as seems likely, the figure will be higher still. The world will need a near-permanent supply of the vaccine. Only then can we bring Covid-19 under control.Once a safe and effective vaccine is discovered, the only barrier to providing sufficient doses should be the world’s manufacturing capacity. But other artificial barriers stand in the way. The intellectual property laws that grant pharmaceutical companies the exclusive rights to produce a particular medicine for a certain number of years are intended to reward investment and innovation into new medicines. These intellectual property rights are often abused and create monopolies, and in the case of the Covid-19 vaccine they threaten to limit the supply, causing deadly shortages and unnecessary delays.Granting one company exclusive rights to the science, knowhow and intellectual property of a coronavirus vaccine will prevent us from getting the billions of doses that the world needs. No private company, however committed it might be to delivering a vaccine, should have a monopoly over this public resource. A global pandemic is not the time to artificially ration the supply of a medicine because of failed ideas about the sanctity of intellectual property. Nor should the market be protected simply to serve the interests of pharmaceutical corporations.It’s also important to remember that AstraZeneca didn’t discover this vaccine. Billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money have been poured into the development and production of a Covid-19 vaccine. AstraZeneca has received $1.2bn from the United States government alone, and at least £84m from the UK government. Nor is the company bearing the risks of this innovation alone: governments are already committing to purchase the vaccine in advance of its production.In the rush to solve the global challenge of finding a Covid-19 vaccine, the leaders of rich countries appear to be relying on the goodwill of companies and a charitable approach towards poor nations and ignoring the barriers that intellectual property and other monopolies present. They seem to be assuming that the only option available is a private, market-based approach directed and controlled by pharmaceutical corporations. As the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, and prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, made clear recently when they joined 140 other public figures in calling for a “people’s vaccine”, this would be a grave mistake.Current distribution plans for the Oxford vaccine are an alarming reminder of what happens when you leave a public resource in the hands of a single company. Around 300m doses have been promised for developing countries by the end of this year – a welcome step, but one that pales in comparison with the 400m doses that will go to the US and UK. The Netherlands, Italy, France and Germany have secured another 400m doses between them. The EU and other rich nations are also pushing their way to the front of the queue. Many middle-income countries, such as those in Latin America, where the scale of the outbreak is frightening, may be completely locked out of these arrangements.When the American virologist Jonas Salk was asked who owned the patent to the polio vaccine he invented, he famously replied: “There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?” Oxford University should heed his remark and show leadership by contributing its knowledge and intellectual property to the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool, where technology and treatments are shared for the benefit of all. Likewise, governments and charitable foundations that are funding promising vaccine candidates should insist the intellectual property and knowhow of the products they fund is shared in the WHO pool.The WHO’s attempt to organise a global system where treatments are allocated equitably is also vital. Its efforts should be supported by a framework that places equitable allocation at the heart of all decision-making – including the moment when companies first sign funding agreements with governments and health agencies. But if the WHO is to be successful in the face of vaccine nationalism, we must also do absolutely everything we can to maximise supply.

He’s nuts, Mum, violent and crazy. I’m heartbroken that this is who I love.”Later she sent another text: “It’s OK. He’s not being violent to me. The crazy mood swings and hard to handle.”Asked by Sasha Wass, QC, representing News Group, whether she had been telling the truth, Heard said she had not told her about all the attacks. “I was trying to talk to someone who might know how it felt,” she added.Heard explained: “My father was violent to my mother … and they really loved each other.”In a subsequent text, Heard told her mother: “I feel really lost and lonely. He’s a madman. I feel I’m on a fastening train but I don’t want to jump off. I stay on the train even though I know it’s about to explode.”Asked by Wass whether that was true, Heard said it was not, because she did not want her mother to tell her father what had really happened.She texted her mother later: “He makes Dad look like a saint when he falls off the wagon.”Heard explained to the court: “My Dad struggled with alcohol and abuse issues his whole life. He’s an addict and he was very violent, but I love him very much.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4515a47cf443ecd5b7b83f305fd44776e55e0729/16_68_1927_1156/master/1927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=400e0be04818c548e139134a720750da","title":"jim carreys 20 best film performances ranked","story":"The rubber-faced funnyman made Ace Ventura, The Mask and Dumb and Dumber in the same year. But as he prepares to publish his memoirs, we ask: was that as good as it got?By and large, Jim Carrey either makes good films or very, very bad films. The latter includes mush such as The Majestic, comedic misfires such as The Incredible Burt Wonderstone and such dreary genre misfires as Dark Crimes. But it also includes The Number 23, a thriller in which Carrey becomes obsessed with a book that he forgot he wrote, about the number 23. The book was written by a man named Topsy Kretts. Say it out loud. That’s right: it sounds like “Top Secrets”. The Number 23 is a terrible film, but you can watch the heck out of it drunk.Have you ever wondered why no one makes live-action Dr Seuss adaptations any more? It is primarily because the Seuss estate hated Mike Myers’s The Cat in the Hat so much that they banned them. But the weird horniness of Carrey’s How the Grinch Stole Christmas might also be to blame. During the film. we learn that the Grinch’s parents were swingers, see the Grinch naked and discover that Christine Baranski really, really wants to have sex with the Grinch. The good doctor would have been appalled.Slightly better was Carrey’s adaptation of Daniel Handler’s kids’ novels. As the villainous Count Olaf, Carrey is just as buried under prosthetics as he was in The Grinch, but the subject matter is more fitting for his sensibilities. It is dark and occasionally genuinely scary, and Carrey’s ad-libs aren’t nearly as overt. If it wasn’t for the subsequent Netflix series, which was thorough enough to put the failures of this film into relief, this would be much higher on the list.By 2008, Carrey’s shtick was just starting to wear off. Had he made Yes Man a decade earlier, there is a good chance that it would have ranked among his best. But there is a palpable exhaustion to Carrey’s performance here, as if he is trying to summon a mania that simply isn’t there any more. Couple this with the almost 20-year age difference between him and Zooey Deschanel’s love interest and you end up with a strange curate’s egg of a film.You could argue that this is the one true hidden gem in Carrey’s filmography. Murdered by its own marketing strategy – the trailer, featuring Carrey hoofing around with some CGI penguins, made it look aggressively stupid – the film is actually a sweet meditation on parental disappointment. It is not exactly a classic, but it is much more thoughtful than anyone gave it credit for at the time.The impact of Carrey’s breakthrough year – in which he also released Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Dumb and Dumber – was so seismic that people tend to forget how soggy and formless The Mask is. Although Carrey gives it everything (director Chuck Russell claims that his rubbery face was worth a million dollars in special effects), the film itself is essentially a loose collection of catchphrases where a plot should be.Carrey’s Riddler is the sole redeeming feature of this lurid disappointment – his mania is underpinned by a tangible sense of hurt – and this might be why he found himself on the outs with his co-stars. Tommy Lee Jones, in particular, was so unsettled by Carrey’s constant scene-stealing that, when he ran into Carrey at a restaurant during filming, he could only muster the immortal line “I cannot sanction your buffoonery” by way of a greeting.In which Carrey plays a man with multiple personalities. One is a nice guy driven to the end of his tether by his wife’s insistence on cheating on him with a black dwarf, the other is essentially Clint Eastwood. This seems like a weird criticism of a Carrey film, but Me, Myself \u0026amp Irene is far too broad. It came at a point where the Farrelly brothers were starting to run out of gross-out targets, and Carrey had to wildly overcompensate as a result.Carrey plays Steven Jay Russell, a real-life conman who falls in love with his cellmate. The film had a difficult release, as distributors and audiences were apparently put off by its explicit gay content, but it is well worth a rewatch. It is sweet, funny and truly heartbreaking in places, and Carrey finds exactly the balance between humour and pathos.The film where the world got Carrey back. For years he had been lost in a fog – focusing on art and bad drama and his increasingly off-putting public persona – but everything snapped back together for Sonic the Hedgehog. His Dr Robotnik swings for the fences in the same way that classic-era Carrey would, loud and overt and monomaniacal, with a dance interlude that would be completely unnecessary were it not the best part of the entire film. It is still a Sonic the Hedgehog movie, so will never be considered one of the greats, but watching Carrey muck around is like watching a man fall in love with his talent all over again. A sequel has already been greenlit. The film that won Carrey his second Golden Globe was an undeniable passion project. By playing Andy Kaufman, a groundbreaking and often misunderstood comedian, Carrey was explicitly drawing a line between them. And when it works, it works magnificently the scenes where Carrey gets to play Kaufman in full flight are giddy with joy. However, the connective tissue is soggy biographical TV movie fare, which is what hobbles it in the long run.More interesting is the behind-the-scenes documentary that came out 18 years later. Jim \u0026amp Andy: The Great Beyond is a fascinating glimpse of what star power looks like when it curdles beyond repair. A heavily bearded Carrey, in the midst of his unsettling “I don’t exist” phase, recounts the pure hell he put Milos Forman through on set: only ever appearing in character as Kaufman, trespassing in Steven Spielberg’s office, getting in real fights with cast members. By the time Carrey channels Kaufman’s spirit to console Kaufman’s orphaned daughter, you might altogether lose your stomach for the film. But it is a wonderful insight into the workings of high celebrity nonetheless.It is hard to measure the impact of Ace Ventura from a two-and-a-half decade remove. Although it hasn’t aged at all well, thanks to some questionable transsexual jokes towards the end, the film is a haymaker of a personal thesis statement. Rarely does someone as unknown as Carrey latch on to a leading role with such utter dedication. Every single thing he does in this film – every line, every gesture, every twitch – is in dogged pursuit of a laugh. He attacks this film and leaves it crumpled on the floor. There are moments that are almost avant garde, such is Carrey’s utter hunger to milk every last ounce of humour. At the time, even if you hated it, it was impossible to leave the cinema without thinking that you had watched a star being born.In 2020, a film that asked the question “What would Jim Carrey be like as God?” would be the most miserable thing in the world, but 2003 was a more optimistic time. Bruce Almighty is a gleaming, finely honed comedy that essentially removes all physical constraints from Carrey’s performance. He lassos the moon and brings it closer to him. He parts a soup, Moses-style. He causes Steve Carell to speak in tongues. Yes, there is a gloopy spiritualism that threatens to overwhelm the film towards the climax, but it remains one of the best vehicles for Carrey’s buffoonery.From this point onwards, every film is a classic. If Ace Ventura saw Jim Carrey kicking the door open, Dumb and Dumber absolutely nailed it to the wall. This is a truly stupid film in the best possible way a road trip populated solely by total idiots. The things that Carrey does with a ketchup bottle alone in this film could fill entire dissertations. Despite this, what keeps the film watchable is the look of petrified delight in Jeff Daniels’s eyes throughout, as he tries to keep up with Carrey. It is as if he has accidentally caught his trousers on a speeding train. Dumb and Dumber was made for $17m. Such was its colossal success that, two years later, Carrey would be commanding pay cheques bigger than that.There is one scene in this film that deserves to be placed in a museum, so that future generations can kneel before it. It is Buster Keaton multiplied by Harold Lloyd, pushed through a particle collider of Charlie Chaplin and Jerry Lewis. It is a scene of total, incredible, comic dedication. It is, of course, the scene where Carrey strips naked and crawls out of a rhinoceros’s anus. I am not exaggerating here. Go and watch it now. Look at the faces. Listen to the noises. It’s like something from a David Lynch film. It is perfect.Carrey received $20m for this role, and the noise surrounding his fee – especially since it came just two short years after his breakthrough – did not help The Cable Guy at all. Expectations were so enormous that audiences flocked to cinemas expecting another Dumb and Dumber. What they got, however, was a lot darker and knottier. There are times when The Cable Guy plays more like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle than a traditional comedy. But while the grotesquely stalkerish nature of Carrey’s character might have startled audiences at the time, this has since matured into one of his best films. The intensity of Ace Ventura is still there, but Carrey keeps finding new places to put it. This was not just his most lucrative role to date, but also his most artistically important.This is the film where everything went right. The Truman Show has a crackerjack logline – a man realises that he has spent his life on a TV set as the unwitting star of a long-running series and tries to break free – an honest, sympathetic script that still allows space for Carrey to do his thing, and fastidiously unshowy direction. You sense that Carrey has always longed for a Groundhog Day a high-concept movie packed with universal truths that allows him to be sincere and zany in equal measure. The Truman Show is not quite there, but it comes awfully close at times.Until this point, every Carrey performance had been an assault either through physical comedy or sledgehammer sincerity, they grabbed you by the throat and refused to let you go. But here, for the first time, we saw Carrey without the affectations. He is small here, almost to the point of not existing, which is fitting since the real star of this movie is Michel Gondry’s kaleidoscope of melancholic whimsy, as written by Charlie Kaufman. Until this point Carrey was a classic overachiever, spending a decade showing us what he could do. Here, he showed you what happened when he didn’t do anything at all. Annoyingly, it was just as good.Now, hear me out. Liar Liar might not have the dramatic heft of a Truman Show or an Eternal Sunset. And it might not have the all-out laser focus of Dumb and Dumber or Ace Ventura. But it is nevertheless Carrey’s best film. Imagine another actor trying to do what Carrey does here, essentially spending an hour and a half possessed by a spirit that prevents him from lying. Imagine how flat and uninteresting it would be. Now, go back and watch Liar Liar. Watch Carrey writhe and contort in the fruitless pursuit of a lie. Watch it take over his entire body. Better yet, this film gave him a family for the first time, rooting his mania in something identifiable. At this stage in his career, Carrey was pumping out films at a prodigious rate – this was his seventh in three years – and he was figuring out new moves at every turn. In Liar Liar, he figured out the impossible: how to be a human being."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6e5aa37ddd2ec5207c7c54bd965f9e4da77e65a/0_106_1616_970/master/1616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=59778fd08e6a05ee879c64c3754a98b7","title":"think fig 17 heavenly recipes for the soft fruit from pizza toppings to poached puddings","story":"Fresh or roasted? Savoury or sweet? Figs are delicious baked in a pie, stuffed with cheese and ham or simply dipped in chocolateObviously, the best way to eat a fig is straight from the tree, in the shade, while the fruit is still warm from the sun. This isn’t always possible, though, in which case allow me to make the case for the fig as a canape. A fresh fig, sliced open enough to admit a dollop of dolcelatte or another blue cheese as this recipe suggests, is simplicity itself. If you prefer something warmer, switch the dolcelatte for goat’s cheese and roast the fruit.Stuffing a fig will introduce you to its two best friends: salty cheese and fancy ham. If you want to experience this taste sensation, but don’t often get the opportunity to neatly pick such canapes off a silver tray at a snooty event, you can always just bung them on a pizza instead. Food and Wine has a recipe for gorgonzola, fig and pancetta pizza, but any combination of blue cheese and cured pig will get the job doneDon’t like pizza? Figs also lend themselves well to salads, but guess what? The vast majority of these also require cheese and ham. Fear not: Yotam Ottolenghi has achieved the impossible with his fig salad the fruits are accompanied by roast onion and hazelnut.If you’re looking for something more substantial, figs go incredibly well with a surprisingly large amount of meat dishes. Throwing some figs – dried or fresh – into a beef or lamb stew, for example, will add fibre and sweetness. But they work just as well with roast chicken, and you can make an excellent gravy with them. Alternatively, Daniel Clifford has a recipe for roasted pigeon that requires the use of figs. A word of warning, though: the recipe calls for more than 40 ingredients and takes eight days to make. Good luck!Perhaps a better start for a fig novice would be a savoury tart. Here I have good and bad news. The good news is that the invention of ready-rolled pastry means that it has never been easier to make a tart at home. The bad news is – you guessed it – you’re going to have to go back to the cheese mines. Donna Hay’s tart is fairly typical, calling for gorgonzola, but you will also find plenty of recipes that require goat’s cheese and stilton. I once manned the vegetarian table at the British Pie Awards and all this talk of cheese pies is giving me flashbacks. Perhaps we should move on.Let’s return to the relative safety of the roast dinner. If you don’t want to roast the figs directly, or make a sauce with them, you can always enter the glittering world of fig stuffing. The use of figs lifts a stuffing beyond its usual dense clag. Nigel Slater’s recipe also uses pistachios, sausagemeat and two types of oat.Then again, a fig is a fruit and fruit is for puddings. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s recipe for roasted figs with honey and ricotta is handy if you need a dessert in a hurry. Alternatively, they’re great poached. Fearnley-Whittingstall also suggests stabbing the fruit with a cocktail stick and then cooking in red wine and orange juice for 20 minutes.But if you have the inclination to go a bit more technical, you’re spoilt for choice. Tom Kine has a honey-roasted fig and almond tart that is not only delicious, but might be enough to convince you that fig tarts don’t always have to be cheesy.If you can wait for autumn, Good Food’s recipe for toffee fig pies – made with melted-down Werther’s Originals, no less – is beautifully comforting. And Ottolenghi, reliable as ever, makes a fig and thyme clafoutis that is giant and light and served with ice-cream.Figs also lend themselves to the sort of paleo “energy bites” that supermarkets put near the tills to try to kid you that you aren’t two aisles away from a massive pile of Rolo multipacks. The Lemon Bowl has a no-cook recipe, where you put dried figs in a processor with walnuts and flax seeds and roll the ensuing mush into balls. I am certain your gut will thank you. Or, you know, you could just dip them in melted chocolate like Regina Yunghans from The Kitchn does. I’m sure it’s the same thing, really.Now you’re loaded up with every type of fig-based foodstuff you can possibly think of, you might as well go the whole hog and get drunk on the leftovers. There are any number of fig cocktails on the internet. By far the most appetising is the fig, honey and thyme prosecco smash from Half Baked Harvest, which is both pleasantly summery and happily low-effort. Or you could just put a load of figs into a jar, drown them in vodka and leave them for a fortnight, if you want your vodka to taste slightly of figs.Clearly, no round-up of fig recipes would be complete without a mention of fig rolls. Paul Hollywood has a very good recipe for these although, as with most Bake Off recipes, you can walk to the shop and buy a whole packet for about 60p. You are welcome."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c14231a882198771e9538309d65d97b1586e057/0_321_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbd83a31f530e02fcda8c397610c34b7","title":"liverpool chelsea premier league match report","story":"How fitting that a knee injury did not prevent Jordan Henderson performing his now customary shuffle before lifting the Premier League trophy at an empty yet joyful Anfield.In a season like no other, nothing has stood in the way of Jürgen Klopp’s remarkable force and the piece of silverware Liverpool have craved for over 30 years. The wait finally ended last month. The party really got going during, and especially after, another piece of history was made against Chelsea.Before climbing the steps to a specially constructed podium on the Kop to receive the title from Sir Kenny Dalglish, Liverpool’s players served up one more rousing and hugely entertaining display to end the league season unbeaten at Anfield. They have now gone three successive league campaigns without defeat on home soil.No other team in Liverpool’s illustrious history achieved that feat. A 59th unbeaten home game arrived courtesy of outstanding goals from Naby Keïta, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Roberto Firmino and the substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain – plus a more prosaic effort from Georginio Wijnaldum – and with a reminder to Chelsea of how far they have to go to be considered challengers at this level.Frank Lampard’s side could have secured Champions League qualification with a point at Anfield but, despite a late recovery inspired by the substitute Christian Pulisic, defeat means their hopes of a top-four finish will be decided on the final day.Chelsea were the more dangerous team until Keïta opened the scoring with a stunning effort, but it was to Liverpool’s immense credit that the post-match party never distracted from their duties on the pitch. And there was plenty to distract them. The fireworks started over an hour before kick off in nearby Stanley Park and intensified over Anfield throughout the game. A group of approximately 100 Liverpool fans ignored pleas to keep away and gathered on Anfield Road to greet the team bus. A security cordon kept them at a distance from the stadium but Merseyside police had to issue a dispersal order as crowd numbers increased during the night.Lampard’s team were in the ascendancy when the contest turned in the blink of Liverpool’s relentless pressing and Keïta’s unstoppable finish. The Guinea international, having dispossessed Willian with help from Wijnaldum, seized on the loose ball and had only one intention as he bore down on Kepa Arrizabalaga’s goal. His thunderous shot beat the Chelsea goalkeeper convincingly from 25 yards, kissing the underside of the crossbar on its way as the Liverpool bench exploded with joy.Alexander-Arnold doubled the champions’ advantage with another memorable free-kick reminiscent of his recent goal against Crystal Palace. Mateo Kovacic was eventually, and correctly, adjudged to have fouled Sadio Mané by the referee Andre Marriner, prompting a furious exchange between Lampard and the Liverpool assistant manager, Pepijn Lijnders. Chelsea’s manager was unhappy at Lijnders leaping from the bench after the foul. He sat back down, only to spring back up again as Alexander-Arnold swept the set piece past a rooted Arrizabalaga from almost 30 yards. The keeper’s movement, and lack of homework on the Liverpool full-back, were poor.Number three arrived when Andy Robertson’s corner caused havoc inside the Chelsea penalty area. Olivier Giroud’s headed clearance struck Jorginho’s arm and, while Mohamed Salah appealed for a penalty, Wijnaldum volleyed the loose ball into the roof of the Chelsea net. It was the 11th goal that Lampard’s team had conceded in their last four away matches.Liverpool were a class apart from the moment Keïta struck but Giroud gave Chelsea a glimmer of hope when he prodded home in first-half stoppage time, converting after Alisson had saved superbly from Willian. The glimmer was quickly extinguished.A strange quirk of Liverpool’s campaign was Firmino’s failure to score a single league goal at Anfield despite being fundamental to their success. That minor blemish was erased in fine style when Alexander-Arnold produced a perfect cross and the Brazilian, powering in ahead of Kurt Zouma and César Azpilicueta, headed past Arrizabalaga.

Salah missed two excellent chances to become the first Liverpool player since Roger Hunt in 1965-66 to score 20 goals in three successive seasons.The visitors reduced the arrears again when Pulisic weaved his way past three Liverpool defenders and centred for his fellow substitute Tammy Abraham to tap home. Abraham returned the favour with a cross that Pulisic took on his chest before beating Alisson, but Oxlade-Chamberlain sealed the win in style when Liverpool broke superbly from a Chelsea free-kick.All that was left was the long-awaited coronation. Dalglish, a late substitute when Liverpool last received the championship on 1 May 1990, performed the honours while families of the players watched from the main stand. They had been allowed in after a U-turn by the local safety advisory group, on condition they watched the game on televisions in the stand. Klopp broke from the throng to salute his wife and two sons in the small crowd while ticker-tape fell all around and fireworks continued to explode into the night sky. Henderson, injured yet still shuffling, lifted the trophy and 30 years of frustration along with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b1d4e12364d6847a468ae1e4852cf9df9619266/399_34_3144_1886/master/3144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a85fe17da22915a346332a044594b1cd","title":"happiness and sadness abound as genoa edge out sampdoria in derby","story":"As the city reconnects two years after tragedy, Genoa and Sampdoria played a Derby della Lanterna unlike any other“Can happiness be sad?” The question was posed by Fabio Quagliarella in an open letter published this week by Gazzetta dello Sport. The Sampdoria captain was looking ahead to Wednesday’s derby against Genoa, but also to the imminent inauguration of the Saint George bridge, built to reconnect a city ided since the Morandi bridge collapsed two years ago.As Quagliarella observed, the new construction will benefit everyone who lives in Genoa. Designed by the renowned architect Renzo Piano, its lights and supporting pillars have been shaped to evoke sailing vessels and reflect the city’s maritime traditions. Yet its existence will always be a reminder of the 43 people who lost their lives. “The light of a new road,” wrote Quagliarella, “cannot ever cancel out the darkness of Tuesday 14 August 2018.”Yet there was happiness to be found here all the same. Firstly, in the simple fact of being able to play competitive games. Sampdoria were one of the teams worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with at least eight players testing positive by mid-March. The midfielder Jakub Jankto gave an interview in which he put the figure as high as 15, though he later clarified he did not know the precise number.Players, just like the rest of society, were scared. Asked if he was thinking about when he might play again, Jankto replied: “Honestly, no. The only thing that interests me now is that all this ends and there are no more victims and no more people sick. Football, and sport, right now are in last place.”When they finally did return to action last month, Sampdoria had to confront a different fear: that of being relegated from the top flight. They were 15th, and just a point above the drop zone.Yet Samp would arrive at this week’s derby in a much happier place. From 1 July they had won five games out of six, surging to 41 points. Quagliarella, at 37, was once again deciding games with acts of glorious invention. Alongside him up front, the 23-year-old Federico Bonazzoli was starting to deliver on the promise that had earned him a senior debut at Inter eight years before.With four games to go, Claudio Ranieri’s team were mathematically safe. The pressure would all be on 17th-placed Genoa, who had at least earned themselves a little bit of breathing space by beating the team immediately below them, Lecce, at the weekend. Perhaps they were fortunate, too, to play this derby behind closed doors. Genoa had not beaten Sampdoria since 2016 – suggesting they have been less adept than their neighbours at handling the pressures generated by a raucous crowd at the Marassi ground they share – and this would have been an ‘away’ game.The municipal council did submit a request to the league to allow some fans in, but that was rejected. Still, there was no mistaking the derby-week tension in the city. Police managed to keep apart rival groups of fans who had been tagging steps and old ticket offices in club colours. Hundreds of Genoa supporters gathered outside their team’s hotel with megaphones, flags and flares.Their team would make the brighter start, with Domenico Criscito converting from the penalty spot after Omar Colley’s clumsy kick at Goran Pandev. But the lead lasted only 10 minutes before Manolo Gabbiadini pounced on a rebound to beat Mattia Perin from close range. Genoa thought they had restored their lead when Lukas Lerager swept home from a free-kick before half-time, but his goal was disallowed for offside after a VAR review.The second half settled into a stalemate. Samp had more of the ball but neither side seemed to be pushing hard for a winner. Would the tempo have been different in a full stadium? Perhaps, but the question feels moot. This season has been irrevocably marked by coronavirus in so many ways that it becomes absurd to parse them apart.Sampdoria’s intensity did finally raise a few notches after Genoa got their noses back in front in the 72nd minute. Lerager had not scored previously this season, but it was he who pounced again after Filip Jagiello won the ball from a bumbling Bartosz Bereszynski and laid it back to the edge of the box. A first-time strike caught the keeper, Emil Audero, flat-footed at his near post.Lerager celebrated with an imitation VAR check, continuing a lengthy consultation with an imaginary earpiece even as the rest of his team trotted back to their own half. Sampdoria flooded forward in response. Quagliarella, on as a second-half substitute, deployed clever touches to create openings for his teammates in the box, but none could force the ball home.Genoa hung on. At full-time, their players ran to celebrate under the north stand where their fans would have been. To win a first derby in more than four years mattered enough on its own merits, but this was a hugely significant result in their fight against relegation, allowing the Rossoblu to maintain a four-point advantage over Lecce, who beat Brescia 3-1.Much credit is due to Davide Nicola, Genoa’s third manager this season. They were bottom of the table when he took over in December, with only two wins from their first 17 games. They have picked up seven more from 18 games since.He was in no mood to dwell on such achievements on Wednesday. “We play again in three days,” he stressed in a hurried post-game interview. “There is no time to think about what we have done.” Fans may disagree. If happiness can be sad, then there is certainly room for joy amid ongoing uncertainty. Genoa have not yet secured their top-flight status, but they are in a strong position with three games to go. Come the start of August, they, just like Samp, ought to have more than a new bridge to celebrate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/238caf5ba410e87c6ab2dda7e2defa695d0188cf/0_213_6434_3862/master/6434.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9e081010b411a667156aff1f65dd1cfd","title":"mercury prize 2020 stormzy dua lipa and michael kiwanuka among nominees","story":"More female artists nominated than any other year, including a fourth nomination for Laura MarlingStormzy, Dua Lipa, Laura Marling and Michael Kiwanuka are among the artists competing for 2020’s Mercury prize, arguably the most prestigious award in British pop.More female artists are nominated for the £25,000 prize than in any other previous year, with five solo women and three bands featuring women across the 12 nominees – a contrast to this year’s Brit awards, where there was only one British woman across 25 nominees in mixed gender categories.Two highly respected heavyweights of contemporary British songwriting are likely to become frontrunners with the bookies: folk singer Laura Marling and soul artist Michael Kiwanuka. Marling has now been nominated four times, equal to Arctic Monkeys and PJ Harvey, with only Radiohead having received five nominations. Kiwanuka has now been nominated three times, adding to nods in 2012 and 2016.Kiwanuka told the  that “it still feels just as amazing as the first” time he was nominated. “The Mercury is a place you can celebrate artistic merit – one of the few places that upholds that in the mainstream. It supports music as an art form, more than just a form of entertainment and commercial gain. For me that’s super important.” He heralded Marling’s album Song for Our Daughter, her seventh, saying: “I really love it – I’ve been a fan since I started trying to write songs. She’s younger than me, but it feels like she’s already a veteran in the game.”As well as Lipa, nominated for her critically acclaimed No 1 album Future Nostalgia, there are other upbeat pop choices – fairly unusually for the Mercury – in Charli XCX, nominated for her album How I’m Feeling Now, and Georgia for Seeking Thrills. How I’m Feeling Now, recorded during the coronavirus lockdown, was one of two eligible Charli XCX albums this year, the other being September 2019’s Charli (the eligibility period runs from 20 July 2019 to 17 July 2020).Following on from Dave’s win last year for Psychodrama, British rap continues its artistic and commercial success with nominations for Kano’s Hoodies All Summer and Stormzy’s Heavy is the Head – though perhaps the biggest snub was for east London rapper J Hus and his widely admired No 1 album Big Conspiracy. Kano and Stormzy have both been nominated once before.Indie-rock is represented by the youthful Sports Team, who reached No 2 with their debut album in June Brighton-formed quartet Porridge Radio and a relatively unexpected choice in Newcastle band Lanterns on the Lake, nominated 12 years and four albums into their career for Spook the Herd.Porridge Radio’s frontwoman Dana Margolin told the : “This is the first time we’ve felt acknowledged by the wider music industry. It feels like a really big step up – it does feel quite validating.” She said she was encouraged by the number of women on the shortlist. “In indie and rock, it’s very white and very male, and those things do need to change. Part of it is about having more role models, and the other part is having opportunities for young women to learn how to play instruments, and have confidence at things they’re not necessarily good at yet … without feeling like they’re failures if they’re not good enough.”There is the traditional single jazz nominee in Moses Boyd, the drummer who has underpinned London’s youthfully vibrant and globally respected jazz scene in recent years, while another choice from the fringes is composer Anna Meredith, nominated for the maximalist, high-speed pop oddities on her album Fibs.With the caveat that they may not have been submitted for the prize – and Mercury organisers wouldn’t reveal who was – critically acclaimed artists denied a spot include Harry Styles and his hugely successful psychedelic soft rock opus Fine Line Jessie Ware and her disco album What’s Your Pleasure? outsider folk singer Richard Dawson pop visionary FKA twigs chart-topping pop-rockers in Sam Fender, the 1975, Gerry Cinnamon, Liam Gallagher, and three-time nominees Foals and Coldplay and celebrated Irish groups Girl Band and the Murder Capital, as well as Irish balladeer Dermot Kennedy. Irish, Scottish and Welsh artists are all eligible, but only one of the nominees is non-English: Scotland’s Anna Meredith.Rock and electronic music are often overlooked for the Mercury shortlist, and so it proves here, with acclaimed albums by artists including Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs, Loathe, Beatrice Dillon and Squarepusher also not nominated.Geoff Taylor, head of the British Phonographic Institute which organises the prize, said the nominees were a reminder that “the creative brilliance of our artists is a constant, even when the world is turned upside down”. The coronavirus pandemic means that a traditional live awards ceremony is unlikely, though it has not yet been cancelled. Either way, the prize will be awarded on 24 September, with the ceremony broadcast on the BBC and, for the first time, for global audiences via YouTube.The judging panel of musicians, journalists, industry figures and radio presenters features two new names this year, in three-time nominee Anna Calvi and DJ Gemma Cairney. Other famous faces include soul and R\u0026ampB singer Jorja Smith, Supergrass frontman Gaz Coombes, and jazz singer Jamie Cullum. The judges heralded all the nominated artists as having “an irresistible urgency, a belief that their music matters more than ever”.The Mercury prize began in 1992, but Kiwanuka said he has noticed huge changes in popular music even since his first nomination in 2012. “Back then was more about getting the biggest song, where now people are trying to express themselves fully and make statements with their music. The album is the best format to do that.“People are more aware and in tune with the state of the world now – it’s quite a heavy feeling at the moment. The global pandemic, the events in America with George Floyd, global warming there’s also more of an awareness of race and gender equality. All these things have a magnifying glass to them now, and musicians are using their platform to express themselves. As a result, albums have become more important again. Music has become more vital, in a lot of ways.”Anna Meredith – FibsCharli XCX – How I’m Feeling NowDua Lipa – Future NostalgiaGeorgia – Seeking ThrillsKano – Hoodies All SummerLanterns on the Lake – Spook the HerdLaura Marling – Song for Our DaughterMichael Kiwanuka – KiwanukaMoses Boyd – Dark MatterPorridge Radio – Every BadSports Team – Deep Down HappyStormzy – Heavy is the Head"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88fdcdf92193c19f588229a4aeb85a230406dfa3/0_204_583_350/master/583.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8e982073b35c2f8d57b7cf9570e4b62c","title":"is kanye west seriously running for president podcast","story":"The rapper has entered the race for the White House invoking his religious beliefs.

And what we’ve got is an infantile narcissistA more fruitful strategy for Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions might be damage limitation. To accept that Keir Starmer is far brighter, better prepared and more obviously sincere and try to dead-bat his way through the half-hour with short, anodyne responses. It might not be the rallying cry for the Tory troops that he would like to give, but it would sure as hell be better than being comprehensively owned by the Labour leader week after week.But Boris is temperamentally incapable of such an act of self-preservation. His natural instinct is for destruction, both of himself and everything around him. So while Starmer is The Daddy, Johnson is visibly regressing in front of our eyes. When he first became PM, he would act the adolescent: Kevin the teenager. Then he slipped back to the grumpy 10-year-old. Now he is like a toddler barely out of nappies. At the current rate of progress, his baby son will soon be reading him bedtime stories.What’s more, it appears Boris either is unaware of his decline or believes it to be of little consequence. Or possibly both. He may even be right for the time being. After all, most people aren’t paying much attention to his weekly half-hour of humiliation, he has an 80-seat majority, and an election is four years off. Yet his lies and tantrums still have the power to corrode. And few prime ministers have done more to undermine democracy than he has.For the last PMQs before the summer recess, Starmer focused on the intelligence and security committee’s report on Russian interference in UK politics. How come Johnson had managed to sit on something that had highlighted Russia as an urgent and immediate threat for 10 months?The honest answer would have been that Johnson had actually intended to sit on the report for much longer than 10 months but had been caught on the hop when Chris Grayling, his nominated stooge for the committee chair, managed to lose a vote that had been rigged in his favour. He should have paid more attention to those who had warned him there was no bad situation that Failing Grayling could not make worse. There should be statues to Grayling in every city, symbols of hope for losers everywhere.Instead Boris did what he always does. He ignored the question and went on the attack. No one cared more about national security than him, and the reason successive Tory governments had failed to even wonder whether the Russians might have influenced the Brexit referendum was because Vladimir Putin had assured them that such an idea was totally unthinkable. The Russian president had been far too busy in 2016 with acts of espionage elsewhere in the world, so there was clearly no need for the UK to go looking for evidence of interference that everyone knew didn’t exist. There couldn’t be a smoking gun if no gun existed in the first place.To make the point more forcefully, Boris concluded by saying that Starmer had failed to condemn the Salisbury novichok poisonings. Now it was Keir’s turn to look confused, as Johnson had clearly failed to notice that Jeremy Corbyn had been replaced as leader of the Labour party back in March. Starmer pointed out that he had strongly supported government actions against the Russians on that occasion. What’s more, as director of public prosecutions he had also introduced proceedings against Russia on behalf of Alexander Litvinenko’s widow.Yeah but no but yeah but no but you’re still basically pro-Russian, said Boris, by now stuck on autopilot. And in any case, all this stuff about the ISC report was just sour grapes from “Islingtonian remoaners” who still hadn’t got over the result of the 2016 referendum.This was Boris’s great Freudian slip. Because Labour under Starmer has never once tried to refight the Brexit vote. The only reason Johnson could have had for bringing the subject up was that it had been his fear that Russia might have tried to influence the referendum that had led him to suppress the report. After all, if he had really believed in Russia’s innocence he would have published it before the last election.Visibly rattled, Boris now just lapsed into meaningless, disconnected phrases and a lame gag about “more flip-flops than a Bournemouth beach”. He really does need to get himself a new scriptwriter. Starmer merely sighed that this was a bit rich coming from a man who as a journalist had two contradictory columns for every occasion.“We are delivering as the people’s government,” Johnson insisted. Only I don’t remember him promising us the highest death rate in a global pandemic, a disastrous no deal with the EU and the likelihood of the biggest recession in decades.The only person unable to see quite how damaged Boris is, is Boris himself. He is the emperor with no clothes and it’s not a pretty sight. Even when he’s losing badly, he imagines himself to be a winner. The Tory MP Nusrat Ghani suggested he might care to spend his staycation recess reading Winnie the Pooh. Boris’s eyes lit up. There were too many Eeyores on the Labour benches. What the country needed was a Tigger like him. Except it doesn’t. What the UK really needs is a grown-up in charge. And what we’ve got is an infantile narcissist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0be57616e0a9e8ce10f3cc6624a8c02153e48a64/0_165_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=949d4c4759f9953b99383c09d6b451ff","title":"considerable gaps remain brexit talks says uk negotiator david frost","story":"David Frost warns of prospect of no deal but insists agreement can still be reached by SeptemberBritain and EU still face “considerable gaps” in significant areas over a Brexit deal, the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, has said, while insisting he still believes an agreement can be reached in September.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in his own comments following the end of the fifth round of formal talks, appeared more downbeat, saying the UK had “not shown the same level of engagement” as the EU in trying to find solutions.In a No 10 statement, Frost warned that both sides must nonetheless face the prospect of no agreement being reached, given the distance on reaching level playing-field terms for trade, and fisheries.Frost added: “Despite all the difficulties, on the basis of the work we have done in July, my assessment is that agreement can still be reached in September, and that we should continue to negotiate with this aim in mind.After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers\u0027 rights.Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro.EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”.David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn\u0027t enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own partyThe UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron\u0027s resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime ministerAfter years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May\u0027s attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU.“Accordingly we look forward to welcoming the EU team back to London next week as planned for informal discussions and to the next negotiating round beginning on 17 August.”At a press conference, Barnier said much of the interactions had been about Boris Johnson’s “red lines” over Brexit – no role for the European court of justice, the UK’s freedom to determine future laws, and agreement on fisheries.He said: “We have tried to understand how these three red lines can be squared with our commitment to a comprehensive new partnership as set out in the political declaration signed by Prime Minister Johnson on 17 of October last year.”He said the EU had engaged “sincerely”, adding: “Over the past few weeks the UK has not shown the same level of engagement and readiness to find solutions respecting the EU fundamental principles and interests.”Hopes had been slim for any breakthrough during this round of talks, held in London, despite Downing Street’s position earlier this year that agreement would be needed by summer so a deal could be agreed and ratified before the end of the Brexit transition period in December.In his statement, Frost said “substantial areas of disagreement remain”, with the EU and UK still deadlocked over some areas. However, he said there had been some progress.“Specifically, the EU has listened to the UK on some of the issues most important to us, notably on the role of the court of justice, and we welcome this more pragmatic approach,” he said.“Similarly, we have heard the EU’s concerns about a complex Switzerland-style set of agreements and we are ready to consider simpler structures, provided satisfactory terms can be found for dispute settlement and governance.“We have also had constructive discussions on trade in goods and services, and in some of the sectoral agreements, notably on transport, social security cooperation, and participation in EU programmes. We have also continued to deepen our understanding of each other’s constraints on law enforcement.”The biggest gaps were over the level playing field and fisheries, the statement added, with Frost noting that the next talks would begin little more than four months before the end of the transition period.“Although we will continue energetically to seek an agreement with the EU, we must face the possibility that one will not be reached, and we must therefore continue preparing for all possible scenarios for the end of the transition period at the end of this year,” he said.Frost’s tone, while cautious, was notably more upbeat than exchanges earlier in the talks.In May, after an earlier set of negotiations, Frost accused Brussels of treating the UK as an “unworthy” partner by offering a low-quality trade agreement that he said would force the country to “bend to EU norms”.In a letter to Barnier, Frost said EU proposals on state aid rules were “egregious” and “simply not a provision any democratic country could sign”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d8845bf6b36611fcd97fefe88bf664bd8743b9/0_8_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4d6e886b62b65b0b030f35e5e02c94","title":"we started selling bikes to key workers how londons friendliest bicycle shop coped with lockdown","story":"Winston Farquharson’s passion for cycling has already seen him survive a recession – and he’s determined to make it through this challenge tooWinston Farquharson’s 30-year passion for cycling started with a rugby injury. “My doctor advised me to take up riding to help with my recovery, and I really got the bug for it”, he says as he tidies his cycle shop in Penge, south-east London, ready for the morning rush. “I joined a local cycling shop’s racing team, and travelled up and down the country to race. Sadly, though, I never quite made it.”Retraining as a sports therapist, an accident caused Farquharson to have a career rethink. “I got involved with a charity which helps disabled people back into work, and realised what I really wanted to do was run my own business. The charity supported me as I wrote my business plan,” he says.The result was SE20 Cycles, a repair and custom-build cycle shop on Penge High Street, which opened in September 2008. Since then, SE20 Cycles has become a hub for the local cycling community – so much so that last year Farquharson converted the shop’s waiting area into a coffee shop.“I wanted to create a friendly place for new cyclists and enthusiasts alike,” Farquharson says. “A lot of novice cyclists don’t like to ask questions in case they’re being silly. We wanted to avoid that, and plenty of customers have told us we’re less intimidating than many cycle shops.”When Covid-19 hit, Farquharson made the tough decision to close the repair shop to walk-in customers, putting his mechanic on furlough for six weeks, and prioritising local emergency and key workers.“As we were suddenly deemed an essential service, it felt natural to prioritise key workers in a bid to help the national effort,” Farquharson says. “For the first two weeks of lockdown, key workers could jump the queue and receive repairs at a heavy discount, or for free, which they really appreciated,” he says.“They could buy bicycles from us at trade price, too, which we started selling as a reaction to Covid-19. It meant the early weeks of lockdown saw us mostly used by NHS and other key workers.”Worried about his customers having to queue alongside shoppers waiting to go into a local supermarket, Farquharson developed an online booking system so they could book a slot for a service or repair, drop their bike off, and go.“Having two queues running side by side just wasn’t safe, so after two weeks of mayhem I spent a few hours each evening adding to and testing the booking system,” says Farquharson. “Adding stock to the site for sale was also prioritised, so people wouldn’t have to travel to us,” he says.“Initially, the system created as many problems as it solved – we had to get the message out that we were going online for booking and sales using an A-board outside the shop and social media. Online bookings are also quite hard to manage because we’re busy with the shop, and it means we don’t have the social interaction we used to with customers, which is a shame.”Customers can book and pay online, or use payment cards in store or at their doors. Other safety measures include disinfecting bikes when they’re dropped off and before they’re collected, and offering collection and delivery for customers who don’t live within walking distance. Both Farquharson and his mechanic have their own sets of tools, and spray down larger, shared pieces of equipment between each use.As lockdown eases, Farquharson plans to keep his online booking system in place, but hopes more people will visit the shop in person. “Hopefully, once lockdown eases, it will give us more space to spend with customers, and maximise our time with them,” he says. “Realistically, I also have to consider how many of the people taking up cycling now when the roads are quiet will carry on when things get back to normal,” he says.“We need to keep them cycling, so to help with that I’m introducing a booking club, where customers can pay a fee each month that will give them access to our services. We’ve got a garden at the back that I’m looking into developing, and I’m going to put some barriers up around our portion of land out front, to help with distancing. A lot of thought has to go into how shops are going to work in the future.”While Farquharson might miss the camaraderie of customers stopping by for coffee, he’s grateful to his army of loyal locals for the support small businesses like SE20 Cycles so vitally need.“A lot of shops on the high street will struggle getting people back through the doors, and small shops might find it especially hard to adapt.

In 2009, she opened her own florist business, The Flower Lounge in Didsbury, Manchester.Wild says one of the main things she loves about her job is her customers. “Being nestled within such a wonderful community is really special. We’ve been here for more than 10 years, so our customers do feel like family.”The day the government lockdown was announced, Wild was floored. She was concerned for her business, her staff and the future but she also felt devastated about what the closure would mean to her customers.“Flowers are so emotive and sentimental. They’re an everyday item we use to express celebration, affection and remembrance. Often when we can’t use words, we use the gift of flowers. To have that suddenly out of people’s grasp was concerning.”Since that day, The Flower Lounge team has worked to find ways to carry on serving its community. On day two of lockdown, having already ordered a large delivery of fresh flowers, Wild and her team set about creating beautiful bunches of blooms, leaving them outside for passersby to pick up for free.Then, like many entrepreneurs across the UK, she had to reflect on the business, asking herself how it could creatively adapt and still provide a quality service.After closing for several weeks, Wild focused on the logistics of continuing the business in a safe way that would also support growers.“Without the flower growers, there would be no industry to return to. During this time, we’ve tried to support as many British growers as possible.”Happily, The Flower Lounge continued to receive inquiries from customers hoping to purchase flowers, which gave Wild confidence.“We’ve focused on seasonal blooms, offered a DIY vase kit and wreath set to replace our workshop offering, and even created a ‘drive-through’ service in the run-up to Mother’s Day,” she says.The Flower Lounge switched to contactless payments immediately and focused on understanding the needs of its customers. For example, it began to offer more plants because of their positive impact on people’s mental health and air purifying qualities.But it hasn’t been easy – 70 weddings have been postponed and 200 workshop places cancelled. Staff have been furloughed to help weather the storm.“Communication with our staff and our customers has been essential,” Wild stresses. “We recognise that not all businesses have communicated effectively, and we wanted to make this a priority.”Using its social media channels and newsletters, the shop has kept customers up to date as much as possible.“We’ve also used our social channels to share acts of kindness, such as asking our followers to nominate key workers to receive a gift from The Flower Lounge,” Wild says.Change can be unnerving, but Wild still has her entrepreneurial spirit to fall back on. In fact, she spotted an opportunity for a new service she intends to keep running as things return to normal, an online pivot that’s allowed her to be more versatile as a business.“We now offer a subscription service where customers receive a delivery of beautiful flowers that they can arrange at home. We initially offered this to help those working from home – it’s been hugely popular, so we’ve decided to keep it going.”Once she heard that shops would be allowed to reopen on 15 June, Wild couldn’t wait to flip the sign from Closed to Open – after a lot of preparation to keep everyone safe. Staff have received training and there have been changes to their working systems behind the scenes.“We’ve really missed interacting with our customers. It’s important to us that they continue to have a lovely experience and that they feel comfortable in our shop.“To achieve this, we have clear signposting, we are limiting the number of people in the shop and will continue to maintain excellent hygiene standards.“We’re also encouraging pre-orders and initially we will be cashless.”Support from the local community, friends, customers and family has been “phenomenal” and the backing from the wider business community has meant so much to Wild and her team.“I’m really happy to see big organisations such as Visa show support for independent businesses and help to highlight just how important the high street is to us all.”Shop local.

I think a lot of small businesses felt the same.”Mills usually spends her days at The Workshop, Sprout’s retail space and the hub of production for her bright and playful made-to-order clothes. Just a few minutes’ walk from Bexhill beach, it started life as a shared workspace, but as Sprout quickly grew, she was able to dedicate the whole space to her own business.A place for creativity and connecting with customers, having to close the shop was a big blow. But, after a brief dip in sales just before lockdown, which she links to customers’ collective financial uncertainty, online sales soon began to rise. “Once lockdown started, because everyone was at home buying, my online business just flourished,” she says.Underpinning such a boost in online sales is Mills’ savvy decision to expand her website and ersify into other online marketplaces such as Etsy. Where she would once open the shop six days a week and make daily post runs, Mills was only able to manage twice-weekly trips to her workshop at the beginning of lockdown because she was juggling work and childcare. Postage was reduced to once a week. But the extra time proved just what she needed. “When I wasn’t able to get to my workshop and sew, I was spending a lot more time doing computer work, and that has had a hugely positive impact on the business now,” she says. “I’ve managed to do a lot of stuff that I’ve been meaning to do for years but literally not had the time!”As well as bolstering her online presence, Mills used lockdown to work on another long-held goal: expanding into womenswear. Her new line of made-to-measure women’s underwear, crafted from the same organic, colour-clash fabrics that make her childrenswear so popular, immediately became Sprout’s bestselling range.As well as her efforts in keeping the business alive and thriving during lockdown, Mills also credits consumers thinking more carefully about what and how they’re buying. “People have been looking at more sustainable ways of buying and my stuff is all organic – that’s why I thought it was important to go into doing some adult designs. Sales of my reusable products, such as reusable wipes and makeup pads, have also been huge,” she says.Sustainability is not just an extra selling point for Sprout, it’s something that has earned Mills a loyal community of like-minded customers. While face-to-face interaction has been impossible, Mills has found her brand’s Facebook group to be an essential source of positivity and communication, spotlighting it as one of her favourite aspects of the business. An 800-strong online community share photos of their “Sproutlets”, and buy and sell pre-loved Sprout items. The latter is something Mills is particularly proud of, as it’s proof in action of the longevity of her clothes. “You’ll see this pair of dungarees will be traced back through three or four different children,” she says. “That’s the whole point of my business. They last and they’re not disposable.”While the online side of the business has been booming and her community has prospered through social media, Mills is looking forward to the social interaction that her shop provides when she reopens. “People really love being able to see and feel the quality of the clothes, and it’s lovely when someone wanders in off the street, discovers my brand and becomes a regular customer,” she says.Opening with reduced hours at first, Mills believes it will take time for the high street to get back to where it was and is grateful for support from Visa’s shop local campaign. “It’s a real positive for such a huge brand to be supporting small businesses, it’s a bare essential to us,” she says.Those who venture on to their local high street and into Sprout’s workspace will gain a renewed connection between maker and consumer, as Mills makes each piece right there on the shop floor, an unusual sight when so much of clothing manufacturing happens overseas and behind closed doors. “When parents come in with their children, they’ll sit and watch me sew for a while. I think it’s important for children to know where their clothes are from, to see how it all works,” she says. “It’s been really weird working in here with the blinds down and the door locked. I’m looking forward to opening.”Shop local.

Meet the UK shop owners who have defied the odds and made lockdown work for themChances are that you’ve been reacquainted with your local area since the UK went into lockdown in March. While venturing out for an early morning walk maybe you found parks and green spaces that you didn’t know existed, and when the supermarket delivery slots disappeared you probably turned to the shops that were also within walking distance.Your local high street has taken on a new lease of life as more people turned to the butchers, bakeries, delis and corner shops that remained open to serve their communities. Even the stores that had to close their doors found a way to serve those both near and far. Florists, restaurants, art and gift shops turned to the internet and have been receiving orders from round the corner as well as across the country.So it’s here, on Britain’s virtual high street, that we’d like you to meet 12 local shopkeepers and hear how lockdown has seen them adapt. While the changes they’ve made were fuelled by a need and desire to continue operating at a time when face-to-face shopping almost came to a standstill, many of the adaptations will be carried forward as these business begin to look to the future. Take a walk down our virtual high street and meet the kind of people you are supporting when you shop locally.‘Will people queue to get in? I hope so’: how one Scandi-inspired boutique is getting ready to reopen its doorsHoos, an independent homeware store in Glasgow found a lockdown lifesaver in online trading, but owner Karen Harvey is now also ready to embrace a new era of face-to-face shoppingSince opening in July 2016, a small Scandi-Scottish design boutique on Glasgow’s Great Western Road has become a source of joy and inspiration for passers-by, thanks to its stylish window displays of cool furnishings, homeware and fashion items, not to mention twinkling lights by night and lush green plants that spill on to the pavement by day. So to see Hoos closed and boarded up as lockdown began was tremendously dispiriting, not just for its owner Karen Harvey and her team, but for others too.“I know my customers have found it depressing,” says Harvey. “People who live in the West End who have been walking past on their daily walks find it sad because they enjoyed my window. We always had loads of lovely feedback.”Read the full storyWe still offer a great service, just in a different way’: how a much-loved Bristol gift shop will change after lockdownThanks to its revamped website, Bristol’s CoLab has managed to survive the coronavirus crisis – but that doesn’t mean owner Andrea Mahoney expects things to go back to the way they wereA lot can change in the life of an independent retailer in six months. For CoLab, a gift shop at the heart of the community in Bristol’s buzzing Gloucester Road, Christmas 2019 saw record sales.A treasure trove of clothing, jewellery, art, crafts and gifts sourced from more than 60 independent designers, the shop was on the up. But fast forward to March 2020 and the Covid-19 lockdown, and everything changed practically overnight. “Our shop is small and I was worried for the safety of my staff and customers,” says Mahoney. “So on my birthday, 17 March, we shut up shop.

We wanted to avoid that, and plenty of customers have told us we’re less intimidating and more welcoming than many cycle shops, which I’m very proud of.”When Covid-19 hit, Farquharson made the tough decision to close the repair shop to walk-in customers, putting Joseph, his mechanic, on furlough for six weeks, and prioritising local emergency and key workers.Read the full story‘I’m up until two in the morning sewing masks’: the craft shop making lockdown workMaria Sammur of south London independent craft shop Really Maria explains what lockdown has meant to her, how she has kept her business open and helped the community around her‘My online art classes helped people switch off’: how creativity became a lifeline in lockdownArt shop owner Barry Whitehouse went from having no website to running virtual art classes for his local students – now, they’re joined by people from all over the worldIt may be packed into a small space, but The Artery is full of everything you would ever need to get creative. The Banbury shop is an art lover’s paradise, full of watercolour brushes, lino sets, calligraphy pens and more. Upstairs there is a classroom where owner Barry Whitehouse delivers art classes for up to eight students.“My customers range from complete beginners to professional artists and my passion is to make art accessible and affordable to everyone,” says Whitehouse. “I know all my customers by name and many are retired or ‘recycled teenagers’ as I like to call them. It is wonderful to see the positive effects learning art has, such as mindfulness, confidence building and creating communities.”In March, he was forced to close his beloved shop and put his two part-time staff on furlough. Stuck at home like everyone else, Whitehouse started experimenting with streaming his classes online direct from his dining room via closed Facebook groups. The camera was trained on his easel and he offered step-by-step instructions just as he did in the real-life classes.“Those first few weeks were about getting my older students used to new technology,” he says. “For some, my classes were the only outside contact they got all week.

Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic.“We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Read the full story‘My online business flourished’: the ethical brand that boomed when the high street shut downKaela Mills had to shut her Bexhill childrenswear shop because of the coronavirus crisis, but she soon found success thanks to her savvy decision to expand her websiteWhen the government announced its lockdown measures for the UK, Kaela Mills felt decidedly gloomy about the future of her ethical childrenswear brand, Sprout. “When everything first started, I genuinely didn’t think my business was going to make it through,” she says. “Not knowing how long the lockdown was going to last was incredibly anxiety-inducing.

Seeking a fresh start in Australia, she quit her job as a web designer and packed her bags.“Back in 2001, pilates wasn’t that well known in the UK – so when I saw my local gym in Australia had a studio, I decided to give it a go,” Smith says. “At first I thought: ‘I don’t understand this.’ But afterwards, I realised my back pain had gone away. When I returned to the UK in 2003, I decided to retrain as a pilates teacher, mainly so I could learn how to do it properly.”Once trained, Smith began working part-time as a teacher, meeting with clients in homes, offices and rented studios. But after having her first child with husband Ed in 2011, she decided to set up a permanent base – The Pilates Pod in Hitchin, Hertfordshire.“I’ve been teaching privately on Skype and Zoom for a long time, and looking at bringing more classes online for a while, but we’ve never had the time to do it before. Coronavirus has actually given us the time and headspace to put it into action,” she says.Within three days, Pilates Pod had gone virtual, with Zoom classes and curated content available online. Members were gifted bundles of lessons to use themselves or give away, and free sessions were offered to NHS staff.Read the full story‘The best part was seeing people, even from the doorstep’: how a Scandi baker served its Harrogate regulars in lockdownInspired by his Norwegian grandma’s cooking, Paul Rawlinson opened his own bakery bringing a slice of the Nordics to Yorkshire. But forced to lock down just as he was about to expand, what does he think the future will hold?After five years spent travelling the world as an army officer, Paul Rawlinson decided to settle down in North Yorkshire with his wife - to start a family, and launch a business that he had dreamed about since childhood. In 2012, Baltzersen’s opened in central Harrogate - a cafe where Yorkshire-sourced ingredients meet Scandinavian inspiration. Locals and tourists alike were soon hooked on the homemade smörgåsbord of delights that Rawlinson and his team had to offer.When lockdown hit, a small independent such as Baltzersen’s could well have feared for its future - especially as it had just put the finishing touches to a new off-site bakery, an expansion designed to allow it to bake its own bread among other things. But in adversity Rawlinson sensed opportunity. Within a few days, Baltzersen’s had pivoted to start selling and delivering goods direct to customers. The service quickly proved popular, and Rawlinson ran it with martial discipline, converting the cafe into a temporary “logistics base” to plan and coordinate drop-offs of up to 1,200 products a day to about 100 different homes.“We got loads of nice feedback from people telling us it was the thing they looked forward to each week,” says Rawlinson. “The best part for us was being able to still see the people who we normally would see two, three, four times a week in the cafe, even if it was just from the doorstep, giving us a wave. It was great being able to maintain that connection with our regular guests.”Read the full story‘I couldn’t wait to flip the sign to Open’: the florist who’s ready for life in-store to bloom againDriven by the desire to support UK growers and her customer base, Siân Wild found new ways to bring flowers to people during lockdownAfter spending nearly a decade training to be a florist, Siân Wild swapped her events role, and the European travel that came with it, for an opportunity to follow her dreams.

The couple who won – the aptronymic resident love rat, Grant Crapp, and his long-suffering girlfriend, Tayla Damir – would not have survived the first dumping in Britain.Although the outcomes of more important votes here leave much to be desired, common sense usually prevails on Love Island UK. Character arcs and growth are rewarded. “Couples” often win on the strength of one well-liked contestant: take Jess Hayes in series one, Kem Cetinay series three and Amber Gill in series five. Had it been up to us, the class clown in Australia, Josh Moss, would have been crowned – alongside whomever he was coupled up with by proxy.As someone who enjoys reality TV for what it tells us about our society, I also love what foreign shows can tell us about other societies and cultures. National values and attitudes are gauged not just through contestants, but through differences in editing, tone, how the public votes and what they reward. Britons abhor overconfidence and swiftly boot out show-offs. In contrast, the US asks them for an encore. Indeed, Geordie Shore is one of the few British adaptations to outdo its US predecessor in terms of shock factor. Jersey Shore’s nights out were tame compared with its raucous binge-drinking. For the most part, though, British reality TV is comparatively conservative. Nasty Nick, from the first series of Big Brother UK, would have fared much better on the American iteration, in which points are easier to score with the public when “playing the game”. In the British version of Dating in the Dark, the contestants were fairly chaste, but a snog on the first date was a prerequisite on the Australian edition.Even our version of Married at First Sight, car-crash television in its purest form, masquerades as an earnestly documented social experiment, as if it could be the outcome of an extremely successful stint on First Dates. In the UK, there are four couples. The Australian one, meanwhile, is a marriage factory, with 12. They attend messy dinner parties where all hell breaks loose and affairs begin. In the US, the couples honeymoon together just so they can come to blows.Teen Mom UK has a grittiness that makes it almost a documentary. The American version, however, is routinely accused of glamorising teen pregnancy. Its stars are regularly seen in People magazine and dominate reality-TV rich lists. Farrah Abraham, one of the show’s most famous mothers, is reportedly worth as much as $4m (£3.1m).Nowhere are cultural differences better displayed than in the ever-expanding RuPaul’s Drag Race franchise. Over the years, RuPaul Charles, the self-styled supermodel of the world, has been gunning for global domination, launching seven international editions of the show. Following Drag Race Thailand (and hopefully preceding the much-anticipated Drag Race Australia), the latest drop is the Canadian offering. Off the bat, it relentlessly references its roots with in-jokes that registered with foreigners even less than the celebrity judges. But that was part of the charm – an insight into a culture within a subculture.Watching it, I heard the only French Canadian accents I have come across other than Celine Dion’s, courtesy of Quebec queens Rita Baga and Kiara. The Caribbean’s huge influence in Toronto is represented through Tynomi Banks, who hails from Jamaica, and Anastarzia Anaquway, who is Bahamian. Both dip into patois and bring dancehall to the runway.There are the obligatory jokes about Canadians’ perceived politeness, many a maple leaf motif and a bespoke RuPaul’s closing line, this time referencing the national anthem: “Stay true, north, strong and fierce”. In the spirit of Canadian progressiveness, three judges fill the giant RuPaul-sized hole he has left as the show’s host all vote for the weekly winners in this Ru-mocracy.Like the country, Canada’s series is reminiscent of the US and UK versions, lacking the gloss of its American predecessor, but not its competitiveness. The characteristically self-deprecating queens of Drag Race UK were all potential Miss Congeniality winners, with Baga Chipz committing the cardinal sin of coyness when reaching the top three, saying the other finalists deserved the win more. The stark differences are summed up perfectly in one tweet, describing the vastly different entrances of imagined queens. “I came to this competition ready to SLAY,” the American announces. The British queen? “Elo, it’s Rubbish Titz, I’m a right slag.”The UK version’s seemingly low budget felt fitting for the more down-to-earth offering. There was no cash prize and it was less “Eleganza” and more “Gizza Ciggie” if “gagging” on anything, it would likely be the fumes from the smoking area than the gowns.The UK may not have the glamour of the US pageant system or the New York ball scene, but the show showed off its own rich drag history. Drag has been in the mainstream for longer in the UK, from Shakespearean theatre, pantomime and pubs to the likes of Dame Edna, Lily Savage and the Carry On films. These From influences lead to UK-specific idiosyncrasies British queens are more likely to be able to sing live than lip sync. It was pure joy watching the cast indulge in a specifically British, “banterous” brand of shade – the Vivienne’s put down: “Who put 50p in Cheryl?” was one for the books.Reality TV reveals more than we care to admit. Love Island Australia has probably taught me more than geography lessons did. Where else would I find out what a kangatarian is?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e34a20d45bfca778849cb6e3b4ded313ec594066/0_105_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=047cc929d721f6b06c195da4a538fe88","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about going back to work","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have been shielding about their thoughts on returning to workFrom 1 August, those who have been shielding in England will be able to leave their homes to exercise, buy food and visit places of worship for the first time since March.They will also be able to return to work, rather than continue to work from home, as long as their place of employment is ‘Covid-secure’.If you have been shielding during the lockdown and are returning to work from August, we’d like to hear from you.How do you feel about retuning to your workplace after shielding for four months?

Sunday’s game between Leicester and Manchester United is also scheduled for CCTV 5+, according to the broadcaster’s website.It is not clear whether streaming subscription services – which are the primary delivery service for the Premier League games – have been affected.In 2016 the Chinese digital broadcaster PPTV signed a three-year £564m deal with the Premier League. Scheduled to begin from 2019-20, it was the richest TV deal for the league outside the UK.“Something is going on. The question is what is going on?” said Simon Chadwick, professor of Eurasian sports at emlyon business school, who was the first to report on social media that the games had been pulled, citing sources connected to CCTV.The UK is offering residency to millions of Hongkongers seeking to flee growing Beijing control of the semi-autonomous city, has banned the use of Huawei in 5G mobile networks, and is increasingly allied with the US in criticism of China, including for its treatment of Uighur and other Muslim minority populations.“The general temperature between Britain and the US and China has risen dramatically,” Chadwick said. “It seems to be this last round of Premier League football is getting caught up in it.”Last year CCTV took the NBA off air for months after an executive expressed solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters, and in December did not broadcast an Arsenal game after player Mesut Özil, a Turkish-origin German and practising Muslim, used social media to condemn China’s treatment of Uighurs.“If you take the case of Özil and the NBA case, Chinese TV does have a track record of doing this kind of thing. But crucially, on both those cases, they just posted single tweets,” said Chadwick.“Now we have Boris Johnson making very public and strident statements about Britain’s position on China. It’s an incendiary environment, it’s not about single tweets.”If the broadcasts have been cancelled, Chadwick questioned whether Chinese authorities would even make a statement about it, saying often such decisions were made with no reasons or announcements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df7b691328f658cdcd2f9153bd07344601ac895f/0_147_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=539b5efd3c719a3bcd242e64952bb3fe","title":"deserted beaches empty bars covid 19 devastates thailands tourist islands","story":"Visitor numbers expected to plummet by tens of millions in crisis that eclipses the 2004 tsunami, bird flu and SarsThe streets of Koh Samui, one of Thailand’s most popular tourist destinations, are eerily quiet. Along Chaweng’s Beach Road, a usually raucous party area, shuttered shops stretch into the distance.Before the coronavirus pandemic, it was buzzing with traffic. Now, taxi drivers sit on the roadside, with little hope of finding customers. Where bikini-clad sunseekers once browsed souvenir shops and drank at neon-lit bars, a lone street dog stretches on the pavement.Elsewhere, swathes of Samui’s idyllic, sandy white beaches are almost entirely free of people.About 40 million tourists flocked to Thailand last year, drawn by its spectacular coastlines, ornate temples and famous cuisine. Yet in 2020, the country will struggle to attract even a quarter of that number, according to the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT).Tourism ground to a halt in April, when Thailand imposed a ban on all incoming passenger flights. The country – which has so far managed to contain Covid-19, recording 3,255 cases and 58 deaths – is discussing travel bubbles with low-risk neighbouring countries, but no one knows when these might be established. Borders remain shut to almost all foreign tourists.In Samui, many have gone for months without work. Before coronavirus, Jarunee Kasorn, who works in a local massage parlour in Chaweng, says her colleagues would welcome up to 90 clients a day. They’re one of the few businesses to reopen on Beach Road, but a whole day can go by without a single customer. “If there are no tourists, then there’s no business,” she said. Most of the shop’s 20 staff have left the island altogether, and returned to their family homes elsewhere in Thailand.Though modest social assistance payments were offered to workers during lockdown, this is no longer available.“Many people say we won’t die from Covid, but we will die because we are not able to eat,” says Ta Sasiwinom, who has just reopened her stall at an outdoor market in Fishermen’s Village, known as the walking street. The past few months have been a struggle for her and her two daughters. “We cook more cheaply – eating egg and rice, rice and egg,” she says.Parts of the market, and the nearby beach, have begun to return to life. There are groups of visitors and locals peering at the discounted stalls, but it is still nowhere near as busy as it would usually be. Among those shopping are tourists stuck abroad, foreign residents living in Thailand, and Thais – who the government has encouraged to travel domestically through a stimulus package that offers subsidised hotel bookings.The scheme, and a looming long weekend, has provided a welcome boost, says Lloyd Maraville, general manager of Nora Buri resort and spa. Of the hotel’s 144 rooms, about 100 are empty, though this will fall to 85 over the holiday.In Samui, businesses are focused on survival for now. Just last month it was announced that nearly 100 local hotel owners had been forced to sell. Many more remain shut indefinitely.“I’ve lived here for 20 years and I’m shocked, I never thought it could be like this,” says Rattanaporn Chadakarn, who runs a stall at the walking street. No one knows how long the crisis will last. For now, she adds, everyone is just waiting for the skies to reopen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c030e0586ce1aff57738882e5a60538c33461002/0_129_2985_1793/master/2985.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f59c0a90ba26bf96ad27f19201d29037","title":"when leaders are overwhelmed could two heads be better than one","story":"Joint leadership remains something of a rarity, but the pandemic has provided a moment to re-examine ways of workingWhen Natalie Acton was invited to set up a charity recruiting and training people to become mental health social workers, it seemed like the chance of a lifetime. “I was delighted – it was a really exciting opportunity,” she recalls. “And then I found out that I was pregnant.”Realising she wanted to return to work part-time after maternity leave, and concerned about how she would fulfil her new obligations, Acton trawled her networks to try to find someone with whom she could split the job.That was how she came to connect with Ella Joseph, a fellow former civil servant whom Acton knew only vaguely. “Of all the things I was struck by, it sounded like Ella’s values would be very similar to mine.” A speculative text message led to a meeting over coffee, where the pair quickly realised the idea could work.“When I got that text from Natalie, I was just at the end of my second maternity leave, so I was thinking about what I wanted to go back to,” says Joseph. “Suddenly I was thinking that a part-time option would be great.”In six years as co-CEOs, Joseph and Acton have turned the charity, Think Ahead, into a thriving operation with around 25 employees. Though Acton is soon to move on, their collaboration holds plenty of lessons – for people in senior roles who struggle to juggle for organisations so vast and byzantine that they seem ill-suited for one-person leadership for shareholders, stakeholders and even voters who sense that in a complex world, two heads might be better than one.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theJoint leadership, an idea that dates back as far as the Roman republic, remains something of a rarity, though the odd example stands out. Some schools have experimented with co-heads, as have certain charities, councils and companies. The Green party has had joint leaders, Jonathan Bartley and Siân Berry, since September 2018, while the leftwing activist group Momentum recently appointed co-chairs in Gaya Sriskanthan and Andrew Scattergood.“We take a risk in just having one person leading our organisations,” says Emma Stewart, Timewise’s CEO and co-founder. “We’re all more vulnerable now to something happening outside work that means that we’re not necessarily going to be there consistently. So having two heads, and two brains, is sometimes better than one.”Twin leaders could also give organisations an opportunity to foster greater ersity. But a key question is whether shared roles really work at the very top of big organisations, where investors and other senior executives are used to one person as a point of clarity for decision-making and leadership. How can two people, for example, be relied upon to make the same judgments and decisions for their businesses, not least in the current knife-edge economic climate?A high-profile case in point came this year when the German software firm SAP abandoned a co-CEO arrangement after just six months, citing a need for clearer leadership to cope with the pandemic. Similarly, in February the troubled office space provider WeWork aborted a short-lived experiment to split the CEO role’s finance and product management functions between two executives.“This is a period of intense experimentation, but the challenges that companies are having at the moment, where they’re having to constantly talk to the City, to the capital markets, the last thing they’re going to do is experiment with their CEO,” she says.The big problem, according to Gratton, is that CEOs represent their businesses to external stakeholders. “They’re going to be very interested in your vision, your policy, your values, and unless you are an identical twin to your jobshare, then the market becomes very confused about what you believe in. So I think the CEO is a unitary job that can only be done by people full time.”Stewart, who has contributed to government taskforces on flexible working, thinks traditional objections to part-time leadership roles should be confronted. “They’re the same assumptions that we make time after time, about things that are not normal,” she says. “People need to see different ways of doing things. We’ve got to challenge some of those assumptions that you get in the boardroom, in the same way we challenged assumptions that we didn’t want to have more women in boardrooms.”At Think Ahead, Acton and Joseph have experienced this for themselves, having had to overcome initial scepticism from the charity’s board before proving they could make the co-CEO role work. “It really challenged us,” Joseph admits.Both work three days a week, which means they have at least one overlapping day to catch up and transition. “To give that seamless front does require a lot of work offline,” Joseph says. It also means Think Ahead benefits from six days of CEO time rather than five. “It allows us to be really ambitious. So for example, every year Natalie and I meet every one of our participants on the programme, developing those relationships, and that has really paid off.”The fact that the pair have similar background skills and professional experience has helped. But the main thing, Acton says, is that from the outset they shared a desire to run the charity in a certain way. “That has made it very easy to make decisions together,” she says.Sophie Smallwood co-founded her company, Roleshare, with her husband, Dave, as a service to help make it easier for part-time workers to match mutual skillsets to full-time roles.“I absolutely believe the CEO role can be shared. It’s just down to how,” Smallwood says. “If a CEO role is split in a mirror-like fashion, where two people are in essence meant to be like one, that can create confusion. In a successful scenario, then you would see two iniduals really focus on their strengths and then using each other as a sounding board in areas of uncertainty, maybe collaborating together on joint ventures where they want each other’s input.”Research by LinkedIn suggests women in particular are less likely to apply for senior positions unless they feel extremely well qualified for them. “Imagine if more women were encouraged to apply for more senior roles because the gap didn’t matter as much, because they were matched with someone else who they could learn from and who they could grow together with,” Smallwood says.Timewise’s Emma Stewart thinks that while part-time CEO roles are the ultimate in proving you don’t have to compromise progression for flexibility, now could be the moment to strike for those in a position to consider such a switch. “There are lots of ways of cutting up jobs,” she says. “We’re in an exciting time where we’re being forced to do that right now. And I think if businesses can do it well, they’ll reap the benefits.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

To date, the coronavirus has killed more than 30,000 people in France.Early studies by scientists in the Netherlands, France, Australia and elsewhere suggest sewage sampling for signs of the coronavirus could help estimate the number of infections in a geographic area, without having to test every person.Laurent Moulin, who heads the research laboratory run by the public water utility company Eau de Paris, cautioned that the findings on their own did not mean a resurgence of the virus in the population since France eased its lockdown restrictions.But, Moulin said, when used in conjunction with other data it can be a useful early warning sign of the virus spreading, even before people feel sick enough to seek medical help.“We had the lockdown, which reduced the number of sick people, and then a little while later we saw a reduction of the concentration of Sars-CoV-2 in the waste water,” Moulin said, referring to the strain of virus behind the Covid-19 epidemic.European Union states have agreed on common hygiene standards, such as social distancing and wearing face masks on planes and at airports, to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus, the German transport minister, Andreas Scheuer, has said.“I am pleased that the German proposal was accepted by my colleagues at the European level and that we could agree on these uniform standards,” Scheuer told a European aviation conference.Measures agreed include mouth-and-nose protection for passengers from six years old and social distancing at airports during security checks and check-in. A high fresh-air quota in planes must be guaranteed and information must be available in several languages. However, a middle seat does not have to remain empty in aircraft.The joint regulations meet at least some of the demands made by airlines, as varying standards had caused confusion.The German transport ministry said agreement was reached by officials and had yet to be formally approved by ministers.A hospital in the southern French city of Lyon is testing patients with a new machine that enables them to breathe into a tube to see whether they have Covid-19 in a matter of seconds.The machine is entering a second trial phase after three months of use on dozens of people, among whom about 20 had the virus and the others did not. Unlike the uncomfortable standard PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests, it is not invasive and provides an immediate result.“It’s the same principle as a classic breathalyser test,” Christian George, director of research at the National Centre of Scientific Research at the la Croix-Rousse hospital, told Reuters. “The machine will register molecules in the exhaled air and then detects traces of the sickness.”Jean-Christophe Richard, head of intensive care at the hospital, said the objective was to have the machine fully operational by the end of the year. He said: This type of quick test means we will have the results straightaway and can then move the patient to the right area of the hospital. As we now have a few efficient treatments, the quicker we can diagnose the quicker we can treat them.”Bruno Lina, an independent virus expert who has been consulted on the machine, said it was a step in the right direction, but at this stage was too expensive for widespread distribution in hospitals.“If our hypothesis is proved correct, we could see second or third generation machines that cost less and that would specifically home in on the markers of the infection that we have identified,” said Lina, who heads the National Enterovirus and Parechovirus Reference Centre. The number of coronavirus infections in Romania rose by a record amount for a second consecutive day, the government said on Thursday, and local authorities said they could place dozens of small towns under localised quarantines.Other countries in southern Europe and the Balkans saw spikes in new cases in recent days, raising alarm in the World Health Organization.Romania announced 1,112 new cases, taking confirmed cases to 41,275 since the pandemic reached the country in late February. Some 2,126 people have died.The European Union member has extended a state of alert until the middle of August and several European countries have reinstated travel restrictions for Romanians.A legislative void that enabled thousands of infected people to walk out of hospitals or not be treated at all for most of July was in part responsible for the hike. The void has since been solved through a new parliamentary bill.Another reason was a relative lack of compliance with social distancing rules and wearing protective masks in closed spaces.On Wednesday, the health minister, Nelu Tătaru, criticised attempts to make light of the pandemic and to mislead people into not following the rules. He told reporters:“We are going through a difficult moment. As long as we have these negationist trends, this slighting of the three-four months during which everybody followed the rules ... it will remain difficult.”Earlier this month, the former ruling Social Democrat party accused the government of failing to contain the pandemic. The US government has set a benchmark for Covid-19 vaccine pricing in a $2bn (£1.5bn) deal announced on Wednesday with Pfizer Inc and the German biotech firm BioNTech SE that will likely pressure other manufacturers to set similar prices, industry analysts have said.The deal, which is contingent on an approvable product, secures enough vaccine to inoculate 50 million Americans for about $40 a person, or about the cost of annual flu shots, and is the first to provide a direct window into likely pricing of successful Covid-19 vaccines.It also allows for some drugmakers to profit from their efforts to protect people from the virus that has killed about 620,000 people worldwide, almost a quarter of those in the United States.Unlike other vaccine deals signed by the government, Pfizer and BioNTech will not collect a payment until their vaccine proves to be safe and effective in a large pivotal clinical trial expected to start this month.The US and other governments have previously struck deals to support Covid-19 vaccine development, some of which included guaranteed deliveries of doses. But this is the first deal to outline a specific price for finished products.“The average price for a flu vaccine is around $40,” Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, told Reuters. “It looks good with that comparison. It’s well within the ballpark of reasonableness.”So far, the other major experimental vaccines have all displayed relatively similar data on safety and efficacy, suggesting that no one drugmaker would be able to charge dramatically more than its peers, said Mizuho biotechnology analyst Vamil Divan.Giulio Gallera, the health councillor for Italy’s Lombardy region, has asked the health ministry to draw up new guidelines for people with Covid-19 who are still in quarantine two months after contracting the virus.Of the almost 9,000 people who are currently infected with coronavirus in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, 2,000 people, among them a four-year-old child, must stay indoors as they still test positive despite not presenting any symptoms. Some studies have shown that those with a weak viral load are not-contagious.In Italy, a person must test negative twice in a row before being declared recovered.“These prolonged periods of isolation are generating situations which in many cases are unsustainable, causing negative psychological implications on fragile iniduals, especially the four-year-old girl,” Gallera said. “We all agree on the importance of ensuring people’s safety … but I hope that we are provided with updated guidelines, especially in light of the scientific studies that have shown these iniduals have little chance of infecting.”There were 282 new coronavirus cases registered in Italy on Wednesday, with most of the infections being imported from abroad, and nine deaths. Across the country, 12,322 people are currently positive, of whom 724 are recovering in hospital and 48 are in intensive care. In his near-empty pub in the Algarve in southern Portugal, Samuel Tilley fumed that coronavirus regulations in his home country Britain are keeping tourists away, further jeopardising an already gloomy summer season.Usually packed with tourists at this time of the year, Vilamoura is quiet, leaving bar staff at Tilley’s O’Neills pub without much to do but brood over Britain’s decision to leave Portugal off a list of more than 50 countries safe enough for travel without restrictions.“It was very shocking. I don’t believe there’s any logic behind it,” Tilley said, while keeping an eye out for the rare thirsty customer walking in to have a refreshing pint by the harbour.“There are some wonderful people here in the Algarve and beyond and I feel this decision by the British government really hurt them.”Portugal initially won praise for its quick response to the pandemic but a persistent count of several hundred new cases per day concentrated in and around Lisbon in the past two months has worried authorities at home and abroad, leading Britain and other European nations to impose restrictions on travel from the southern European nation.Sunbeds are left empty and lonely waiters stand outside restaurants with menus in hand but no holidaymakers to speak to.“It used to be so busy that you would stand shoulder to shoulder,” Welsh tourist Nadine said as she walked around nearly empty streets in nearby Albufeira.Coronavirus cases in the US approached 4 million on Thursday, with more than 2,600 new cases every hour on average, the highest rate in the world, according to a Reuters tally.Infections in the United States have rapidly accelerated since the first case was detected on 21 January. It took the country 98 days to reach 1 million cases. It took another 43 days to reach 2 million and then 27 days to reach 3 million. It has only taken 16 days to reach 4 million at a rate of 43 new cases a minute.The federal government, state governors and city leaders have often clashed over the best way to tackle the pandemic, leading to a confusing patchwork of rules on issues such as mask wearing in public and when businesses can open.President Donald Trump has recently shifted his tone. He had previously been reluctant to wear a mask but this week encouraged Americans to wear face coverings and recently appeared in public for the first time with one.Of the 20 countries with the biggest outbreak, the United States ranks second for cases per capita, at 120 infections per 10,000 people, only exceeded by Chile.With over 143,000 deaths, or 4.4 fatalities per 10,000 people, the US ranks sixth globally for the highest deaths per capita. It is exceeded by the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Chile and France.Globally, the rate of new infections shows no sign of slowing, with the disease accelerating the fastest in the US and South America, according to the Reuters tally, based on official reports.I’m Amy Walker, taking over the global coronavirus blog from my colleague Jessica Murray. I’ll be keeping you up-to-date with all the key developments throughout the rest of the day.Here are the key developments from the last few hours:Everyone knew that reopening Greece to tourist markets would be a calculated risk, fraught with the danger of potentially importing coronavirus cases with the need to keep an economy overly dependent on tourism afloat. As holidaymakers fly into the country, and trickle into the Greek capital, the extent to which the gambit has paid off is becoming ever clearer. The data, say hoteliers, is disheartening at least thus far. Nationwide, the chamber of hoteliers of Greece has seen profits plunging by an unprecedented €5.6bn (£5bn) in 2020. In Athens, where the Hilton and iconic Grande Bretagne only opened this month, occupancy rates are at an all-time low. Losses in the region of Attica and the Argosaronic Gulf alone, are expected to exceed €300m through January to June.Some myths have been busted. With Britain’s high contagion and fatality rates, industry figures worried that tourists flying in from the UK would pose a particular risk. Mass testing of passengers arriving on flights from Britain ultimately proved exceptional for what it didn’t show: of the 3,000 tested for the virus, within 48 hours of airlinks being resumed, not one positive case was found. Tourism officials now say the sector’s immediate future will depend on arrivals from the UK, Greece’s most lucrative market and after Germany by far the country’s biggest.On Tuesday, Athens’ deputy civil protection minister, Nikos Hardalias, announced that 295 foreign travellers had tested positive for coronavirus between 1-19 July. Of that number, the vast majority were from neighbouring Balkan countries, with most from Serbia, he said. The rise has alarmed epidemiologists in a country that, to date, has registered 200 Covid-19 deaths and 4,077 cases of coronavirus, far lower than its European neighbours. As the presidential motorcade pulled away from the main hospital in Peru’s second city – fleeing an angry protest by medical staff and relatives of Covid-19 patients – one woman broke away from the crowd.Celia Capira ran sobbing after the truck carrying the president, Martín Vizcarra, yelling for him to go and see for himself the grim conditions at the hospital, where her husband was fighting for his life.Footage of Capira’s futile pursuit on Sunday quickly came to symbolize official indifference as the pandemic continues to scourge Peru – now the sixth worst-hit in the world with 362,000 reported coronavirus cases and 13,579 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.Capira’s 57-year-old husband, Adolfo Mamani, died Tuesday in Arequipa’s Honorio Delgado public hospital. And in his fate, many see a reflection of the tragic lottery facing Covid-19 patients inside Peru’s precarious public health system.The Philippines has reported 2,200 new coronavirus infections and 28 new deaths. The health ministry said total deaths now stand at 1,871 and infections have risen to 74,390. The south-east Asian nation’s coronavirus task force on Thursday reimposed a ban on non-essential outbound travel for Filipinos, two weeks after it lifted it.An Irish government “staycation” subsidy is expected to reimburse couples up to €250 (£228) on hotel and restaurant bills.The scheme is part of a €7bn stimulus package of grants, tax cuts, capital spending, welfare and employment supports to be unveiled on Thursday.In an effort to shore up the hospitality sector and encourage people to holiday in Ireland, the staycation voucher will offer consumers a tax refund of up to €125 per person when they spend about €600 on accommodation, food or non-alcoholic drinks.The government is reportedly investigating whether the rebate could be claimed via an online system or app.Authorities have published a “green list” of 15 countries deemed relatively safe for travel – it includes Italy, Greece, Greenland and Finland – but are still urging people to spend their holidays at home.Ryanair, which wants to entice passengers to additional destinations, responded with scorn, calling the list useless, idiotic and on par with Father Ted.AstraZeneca and others should not own a lucrative patent on a medicine that is needed by poor as well as rich nations, write Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, and Winnie Byanyima, UN undersecretary general. Once a safe and effective vaccine is discovered, the only barrier to providing sufficient doses should be the world’s manufacturing capacity. But other artificial barriers stand in the way. The intellectual property laws that grant pharmaceutical companies the exclusive rights to produce a particular medicine for a certain number of years are intended to reward investment and innovation into new medicines. These intellectual property rights are often abused and create monopolies, and in the case of the Covid-19 vaccine they threaten to limit the supply, causing deadly shortages and unnecessary delays. France is to distribute 40m free reusable masks to its poorest citizens, the health minister Olivier Véran announced on Wednesday. The announcement came after criticism the new rules that came into effect on Monday making it compulsory to wear a face mask in indoor public spaces, including supermarkets, banks, places of worship and official buildings, was an additional expense for those living in precarious circumstances.Many local town and city halls handed out free, washable fabric masks in May, but the masks will be posted out to those on low incomes who receive top-up health insurance.Le Parisien newspaper worked out that a couple with two children over the age of 11 would have to spend €228 per month for disposable masks or €96 for washable masks.Failure to wear a mask can lead to a €135 fine. Hong Kong reported 118 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, a daily record, including 111 that were locally transmitted, adding to a deluge of new cases that have hit the global financial hub over the past two weeks. Hong Kong extended strict social distancing measures on Wednesday as authorities reported 105 locally transmitted infections. Since late January, more than 2,000 people have been infected in Hong Kong, 14 of whom have died. Authorities have warned the city faces a critical period in containing the virus.Meanwhile Indonesia reported 1,906 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, bringing its total infections to 93,657.  The number of Covid-19 deaths in the south-east Asian nation rose by 117 on Thursday to bring the total to 4,576.Your questions answered on what type of mask to wear to cut the risk of getting Covid-19."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4308213.1595171560!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"learning online when school is a nine hour drive away","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDawn Bateman (right),  her husband Chris and children Samy and Pippa are pictured at their home in the Northern Territory in Australia.  Dawn Bateman grew up on the remote and beautiful Horn Head near Dunfanaghy in Co Donegal, attending Holy Trinity National School and later Pobalscoil Chloich Cheannfhaola in Falcarragh. Today, Bateman and her husband, Chris, manage a 2.3 million acre farm in Australia’s Northern Territory and their children, Samy (4) and Pippa (3), are embarking on a very different educational experience.The nearest town, Katherine, is a six-hour drive away, and the family rarely visit. “We get all of our supplies delivered to Cape Crawford, a little roadhouse. A truck comes twice a week on a Wednesday from the food stores and on Friday with general freight. So we get everything pretty much delivered there or via mail plane once a week. We’ve got an airstrip on the property,” Bateman says. Samy started school this year and, like hundreds of other children living in remote areas across Australia, he is enrolled in a branch of the School of the Air (Sota). The school itself is in Mount Isa in Queensland, about a nine-hour drive away, but all of its 155 students learn remotely. The first of these schools was set up in Alice Springs in 1951 to provide accessible education for isolated children in outback regions of Australia, initially using high-frequency radios. Today, classes are conducted online, with follow-up activities done at home with the help of parents or tutors. For now, Samy’s classes are part-time and largely play-based. “It’s almost like a Zoom meeting...it’s pretty fun getting a heap of four-year-olds together,” Bateman says. “It’s like mustering cats but it’s good for him to talk to other kids.”Next year, when Pippa starts school, the couple will look into getting a tutor. “I know next year it gets a bit more serious and they have their on-air classes and they have set modules they have to complete. They have to do exams and it’s the same curriculum as the other schools. It definitely is difficult and that’s why people employ a governess, as it’s really a job in itself.”SocialiseBateman says she goes the extra mile to make sure her children socialise despite living in a remote part of the country. “You just have to do your best and get them mixing as much as possible.”She says many isolated children cannot participate in school sports or learn to swim as they’re so far away from any facilities. But a rural parents’ organisation has set up an annual sports camp so their kids can have that opportunity. “They do everything they do tennis, they do soccer, they do dance, they do gymnastics and they jam it all into a week. The kids are fried by the end of it.”Bateman says she also takes Samy and Pippa to rodeos in the winter, which is from June to August in Australia, to socialise with other kids but many were cancelled this year due to Covid-19 restrictions. “I didn’t think I’d miss them as much, but I most certainly did.”GovernessAishling Murphy moved from Wexford to Brisbane six years ago. After a few months in the city, she moved to outback Queensland and worked on a cattle station as a tutor, or governess as they are often referred to. Her role was to help the children on the property with their online education and school work. “If there was cattle work to be done we would go out and do it and school would happen when we got back. It kind of changes around the life timetable of home,” Murphy says. She now works as a teacher in a rural primary school, with just 16 students. When schools across Queensland closed for five weeks in April due to the pandemic, her experience as a tutor helped her to understand the balance parents at home had to find when trying to juggle work and overseeing the education of their children.“Most parents won’t have a background in education. I think they need to not be hard on themselves...Sometimes it just doesn’t flow,” Murphy says. “We were very lucky in that all of our kids had laptops and the kids were quite skilled on the computers already. We use the likes of Blackboard Collaborate. It’s like Skype and all of our distance education schools would use that for web conferencing with the kids.” Homework is sent to parents and children with explicit instructions, checking in with parents and then letting students talk to each other at the beginning of a lesson helped navigate the new way of learning. “Kids just want to talk to each other. I would have seen it too when I was a governess and during the first five minutes of the session we just let the kids talk. They want to get that out of their systems,” Murphy says.

He expressed particular concern over the worrying trend of outbreaks of the virus in congregated settings such as the workplace and social gatherings. Dr Henry was also concerned about the number of people declining to be tested when identified as a contact of a person who had contracted the virus. “It is worrying. If you are called you should go for the test.”Dr Henry pointed out that 6 to 7 per cent of asymptomatic people who had been tested were diagnosed with the virus. “People are not the best judges for themselves if they need the test.”One further death of a person with Covid-19 has been reported to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, while there have been a further 17 confirmed cases.There has now been a total of 1,754 Covid-19 related deaths in Ireland, while the total number of confirmed cases stands at 25,819.Dr Ronan Glynn, acting Chief Medical Officer, appealed to the public to continue social distancing.Currently, there are 14 patients in hospital with Covid-19, with six of these in intensive care.

Photograph: Regis DuvignauReutersA draft report by the Oireachtas Covid-19 committee has recommended wide-ranging reform of the nursing home sector, including a governance shake-up and closer oversight of clinical practice. The potential recommendations of the report, seen by The , were drawn up by committee staff and will be discussed by members at a closed session on Thursday. It states that the committee is “of the opinion that the lack of national clinical oversight of care for patients in the private nursing home sector is one of the biggest weaknesses exposed by Covid-19”. It recommends that the Department of Health “urgently review clinical oversight and governance arrangements for private nursing homes”. It also recommends that an independent review be commissioned into the circumstances of all deaths in nursing homes during the pandemic. Submit amendmentsThe draft document is subject to change, with committee members having until next Monday to submit amendments. It also recommends a series of structural reforms, including the integration of private nursing homes into “the wider framework of public health and social care”, and that the care of older people be planned for as part of the implementation of Sláintecare.It also recommends that a review should take place of how patients are allocated under the State’s € 1 billion per annum Fair Deal scheme to ensure their needs are central to any placement and “that patients are not placed in centres which have consistently not complied with Hiqa standards”. Strengthening the role of Hiqa (Health Information and Quality Authority) in enforcing the regulation of care homes is also recommended, as are the introduction of regulations regarding staffing and staff ratios which “need to be strengthened in order to protect patient health”. Staffing structures, salaries, terms and contracts should also be reviewed, the draft report states. ‘Matter of urgency’The report recommends the Department of Health should “urgently support nursing homes which have planned capital works in order to fulfil statutory obligations under the Health Act, 2007”. It says this work should be completed as a matter of urgency, given the ongoing threat of Covid-19 to the health of residents living in congregated settings.Informed sources said on Wednesday that the private nursing home sector does not receive any State capital funding.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Sharon Harland (44) and Rhona Gacey (33) previously charged with theft of \u0026pound400 from the deceasedHe Xiangdong says concerns expressed about unrest in Hong Kong have been \u0026lsquoexaggerated\u0026rsquoProf Tony Foley questions delay in vouchers set to be announced in July stimulus planFine Gael TD expected to win as Independent says no woman has held role in 101-year historyFormer election candidate says \u0026lsquoonly way forward is climate justice\u0026rsquoPlan will include new employment scheme to support wages of those temporarily put on short-time workingSite in Dublin 7 understood to be part of development to accommodate TU studentsChief clinical officer says behaviour has to include minimum contact, avoiding crowds and avoiding close contactProbe expected to land in February where it will attempt to deploy a rover to explore for 90 daysEamon Ryan and Catherine Martin battle for top spot in partyOne further death and 17 new cases confirmed in the StateNow that wearing face masks is mandatory in many public spaces, the practice must be enforcedTrump administration\u0026rsquos rollback of Clean Water Act could have a terminal effectSchools campaign to restore teachers in order to implement physical distancing rulesCo-founder Maria Jikijela says the group will \u0026lsquoreinvest all profits in the carers\u0026rsquoFigures show percentage of follow-up calls being answered appears to be decliningOne in every 10 cases of coronavirus was contracted in clusters in private dwellingsCovid-19 group\u0026rsquos draft report seeks governance shake-up for private nursing homesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4311054.1595452871!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus only 4 100 calls made to check up on 60 000 arrivals to dublin airport","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe figures were released by the Department of Justice in response to a parliamentary question from Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Only 4,100 calls were made to check up on 60,000 people arriving at Dublin Airport in the first two weeks of July, figures from the Department of Justice show. The figures, which were released by the department in response to a parliamentary question from Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall, show that of the 4,121 calls that were made based on information supplied in the passenger locator form, only 52 per cent were answered. The figures show that of 61,844 arriving passengers, the BMU took a sample of 6,195. Of that figure, some 1,974 were exempt from follow-up as they were transiting to Northern Ireland, or in the State for less than two days, according to the reply. Of the remaining 4,121 who were called, 2,129 were answered. In response to questions, a spokesman for the Department of Justice confirmed that “no other department or agency has made any of the follow-up calls in relation to the locator forms to date”. Follow-up calls are also being made in respect of other ports of entry, but are not available, the department said. Dublin Airport is the main port of entry for air passengers to the State. Public confidenceMs Shortall said the figures show “that less than seven per cent of passengers entering through Dublin Airport in the first two weeks of July received any follow-up call at all, and nearly half of those went unanswered”. “How can the public have confidence in the Government’s decision on travel when that is the case?” she said. The percentage of calls being answered also appears to be declining. Figures supplied for passenger arrivals from the end of April to the end of June this year suggest that 64 per cent of of calls were answered, compared to 52 per cent in the most recent figures. Ms Shortall said the “threat of Covid-19 clusters as a result of foreign travel into Ireland is very real”, which the National Public Health Emergency Team had stated “very clearly” in a letter to Government.A department spokesman said “everyone arriving into the country, regardless of where they come from, is required to fill out a passenger locator form, which will be put on an electronic basis by August 10th”.Testing regimeHe added that arrangements are also being made for enhanced follow-up procedures, including a call centre and a proposed testing regime for symptomatic passengers at airports and ports. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the BMU and the Garda National Immigration Bureau carry out form collection and spot checks on behalf of health authorities, with the BMU also making follow-up calls. “Government policy in this area is currently being closely examined and consideration given to the future way of working in relation to this process,” she said.

Five-thousand-year-old Neolithic tombs in Co Sligo are suffering damage and vandalism “on a scale never seen before” and will not survive unless action is taken immediately, archaeological experts have warned.There are 75 passage tombs in Co Sligo, almost one-third of the estimated 240 in the State, according to the Sligo Neolithic Landscapes Group, which is pressing for the county’s Neolithic heritage to be deemed a World Heritage Site by Unesco. So much material has been removed from one passage tomb, known as Teach Cailleach a’ Bheara (the House of the Witch) on the Ballygawley mountains, that an adult can now lie in the hole created. People walking on top of some cairns are doing so much damage “that not only is there a fear that they won’t be there for future generations, they may be lost to this generation”, warned expert Dr Robert Hensey.Saying that it would be hard to find a comparable landscape anywhere else in the world, the group warned that “a very fragile landscape” is under “grave existential threat” from tourism and development.One of Sligo’s best-known landmarks, Queen Maebdh’s cairn on top of Knocknarea, has suffered ongoing damage including the removal of stones from the base of the monument and “walking scars” left by ever-increasing footfall, Dr Hensey adds.The author and archaeologist, who discovered megalithic art not visible to the human eye in a Carrowkeel passage grave overlooking Lough Arrow, Co Sligo, in 2009, said many walkers instinctively climb on top of the tombs.However, the tombs are smaller and more fragile than the Knocknarea cairn and are in danger of collapse, Dr Hensey said. A couple chose to stay in one of the tombs some years ago “with straw bedding, and their tins of beans and washing line”.Stealing quartzMeanwhile, Carrowkeel is also plagued by graffiti, with a significant increase in people scratching their names on to the monuments, causing potential damage to the megalithic art which has been there for 5,000 years.While some damage is accidental, or simply carelessness, there is evidence that some people are stealing quartz to sell online: “For some, taking a piece is an instinct almost like bringing home holy water from Knock,” said Dr Hensey. Meanwhile, there is evidence that some people may be trying to find hidden chambers or entrances to monuments at Teach Cailleach a’ Bheara under the “misguided notion” that there are valuables are to be found. Some people believe valuable gold or bronze objects are deposited inside ancient monuments, he added: “They may not be aware that stone age sites are over 5,000 years old and predate the use of metals in Ireland. ” Under law, it is illegal to be in possession of metal detectors at monuments and sites, or to dig or excavate for archaeological objects, an offence liable to fines of up to €65,000 or up to three months imprisonment.“We cannot have 24-hour surveillance on all of the endangered monuments in Sligo,” said Dr Hensey, but better signage and more engagement with the public would be key to raising awareness about the vulnerability of the sites, he added. ‘Visitor pressure’Ireland has two Unesco-listed Neolithic tombs, Brú na Bóinne and Skellig Michael, and seven more on the UN body’s tentative list. The Sligo group argues that placing Sligo’s tombs on the tentative list could provide some protection.On July 25th two group members Dr Stefan Bergh, an archaeology lecturer at NUI Galway, and Pádraig Meehan, a guide at Carrowmore, will lead guided tours to Teach Cailleach a’ Bheara and Queen Maebdh’s grave to highlight the dangers facing the tombs.The Office of Public Works said it was aware of “visitor pressure” facing Neolithic sites and is working with other State bodies to address the issue, “particularly at those sites, including Carrowkeel, where we have a maintenance responsibility”.The Department of Heritage confirmed that its National Monuments Service (NMS) had inspected the passage tomb in Ballygawley after it was damaged in 2019 and “unfortunately, the latest report we have received does indicate further damaging activity at the site, which is in a very remote location”.

File photograph: Alan Betson The A little under two thirds of Green Party members had voted in the leadership election between Eamon Ryan and Catherine Martin when the deadline for polling passed at 5.30pm on Wednesday. A total of 1,950 of 3,000 eligible members voted in the postal ballot, which will decide who will lead the party until the next general election. There are 2,336 members in the Republic and a further 598 in Northern Ireland. For last month’s vote each member who wanted to vote was required to register. Only a fifth of Northern members opted to register to vote in that poll, some because they lived in a different jurisdiction. This time far more Northern Ireland members are expected to have voted, as it is an an all-island party. The overall number of voters is expected to be about 2,000, which is roughly the same as last month’s election. However, as more were eligible to vote the turnout will be less than 70 per cent, compared to 95 per cent in the poll for the programme for government. Many of the party’s public representatives are of the view the result will be closer than the June poll. However, it would be a major surprise if Mr Ryan were not to win. The percentage supporting the two candidates – both now senior Government ministers – will be keenly watched. If Ms Martin succeeds in running Mr Ryan relatively close, it could lead to some pressure on the Green Party leader – who is now almost 10 years at the helm – to stand down ahead of the next election. Counting will begin on Thursday morning with a result expected to be announced at 7pm. Both contenders will make short speeches, which will be broadcast live on the party’s website immediately after the announcement.

The city has seen record surges in Covid-19 cases in the past couple of weeks and some health experts have suggested that Hong Kong may have to go into lockdown. Photograph: Jerome Favre EPAMore than 15.2 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded worldwide with more than 623,000 deaths, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University. The three worst-hit countries – the US, Brazil and India – account for nearly half of all confirmed cases globally and more than 40 per cent of fatalities. A World Health Organisation (WHO) expert said the first use of a vaccine cannot be expected until early 2021.The following is a summary of the latest developments on the virus around the world:AustraliaAustralia reported its highest daily number of coronavirus-related deaths in three months on Thursday as new infections continued to climb in its second most populous state. Victoria state said it had confirmed another 403 infections, while five people had died from the virus in the last 24 hours. The fatalities, including a man in his 50s, mark the country’s biggest one-day rise in Covid-19 deaths since late April. “This demonstrates the growing toll this terrible virus is taking on our community,” health minister Jenny Mikakos told reporters in the state capital, Melbourne. With authorities unable to bring new infections below triple digits, residents in Melbourne and most of the state are now required to wear masks outside of their homes. Nationally, Australia has recorded about 13,000 coronavirus cases with a death toll of 128.The rise in new infections came after Australia began relaxing strict containment measures imposed in mid-March. While the social distancing rules - which limited mobility of residents and shuttered businesses - slowed the spread of Covid-19, Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it has taken a heavy toll on the economy. The government reported its biggest budget deficit since the second World War on Thursday after committing to fiscal stimulus of around A$289 billion, or 14.6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Australia is experiencing a health and economic crisis like nothing we have seen in the last 100 years,” Mr Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra.AmericasBrazil reported a record number of coronavirus infections, days after the WHO said the country had reached a plateau. The Latin American country registered 67,860 new cases on Wednesday, more than 20 per cent above the previous record for daily infections. The numbers of Covid-19 cases added in the last 24 hours pushed the total to 2,227,514. Deaths rose by 1,284 to 82,771, according to the health ministry. Brazil, a nation of 210 million with some states the size of France, trails only the US in both case and death counts. The numbers, while still high, have stabilised in recent weeks, the WHO said Friday. It urged Brazil’s government to seize the opportunity to take control of the virus.Neighbouring Argentina posted a daily record of 5,782 confirmed cases, the vast majority of them in and around the capital, Buenos Aires, taking the total number infected in the country to 141,900. Peru, which has the second-highest number of cases in Latin America behind Brazil, added 3,688 previously uncounted people to its death toll on Wednesday, taking fatalities to nearly 17,500. The Andean copper-producing country recorded 4,463 new cases for the day, taking its total to 366,550, double the number at the start of June. The numbers point to the struggles nations across the region have had in containing the pandemic, despite widely varying strategies to combat the outbreak.Mexico’s health ministry reported on Wednesday 6,019 new confirmed coronavirus infections and 790 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 362,274 cases and 41,190 deaths. The Mexican government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases.US US deaths from the novel coronavirus rose by more than 1,100 for a second day in a row on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally as leading US Senate Republicans and the White House said they had hammered out agreements in principle on portions of a potential coronavirus-response Bill. California reported a record 12,807 new confirmed cases, bringing the state’s total to 413,576. With the increase, the state surpassed New York as having the most cases. Florida reported 379,619 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, up 2.6 per cent from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 3.5 per cent in the previous seven days. Deaths among Florida residents reached 5,345, an increase of 139, or 2.7 per cent , according to the state department of health report, which includes data through Tuesday. Arizona’s virus cases continued to decline, with the state on Wednesday reporting 1,926 new infections, a 1.3 per cent increase to 150,609 and below the prior seven-day average of 2.2 per cent . The state department of health services reported 56 new deaths, bringing the toll to 2,974.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has forecasted that the US will reach 150,000 deaths by early August.IndiaIndia reported a record jump of 45,720 in coronavirus infections on Wednesday, taking its total number of cases to 1.24 million, the health ministry said. Almost a quarter of Delhi’s 28 million residents may have developed coronavirus antibodies, making it one of the worst-affected capital cities in the world, according to research. A random sample of 20,000 residents by India’s National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) found 23.4 per cent had antibodies to the virus. It appears that the majority were asymptomatic. The coronavirus crisis hit Delhi hard last month, pushing the city’s healthcare system to the brink of collapse, and many died after hospitals ran out of beds and ventilators. Yet the rate of exposure found in the NCDC study is far higher than the city’s officially reported 123,747 cases, suggesting the spread of coronavirus in India may be far greater than the official statistics show. India has the third highest number of cases in the world, and cases are rising there by more than 40,000 a day. The curve of infections is showing no sign of flattening and states across India, from Kerala to Kashmir, have reintroduced inidual lockdowns and night-time curfews in an effort to control the spread of the virusChina China reported 22 new coronavirus cases in the mainland for July 22nd, up from 14 cases a day earlier, the health commission said on Thursday. Of the new infections, 18 were in the far western region of Xinjiang and one was in Dalian city in the northeastern Liaoning province, according to a statement by the National Health Commission. The other three were imported cases. The Dalian case involved a 58-year-old man working at a seafood processing company. Multiple samples collected from the company, including frozen food, processing workshop, canteen and office building also tested positive, state media said. China reported 31 new asymptomatic patients, or those showing no symptoms, up from 22 a day earlier. China will provide a $1 billion loan for Latin American and Caribbean countries to have access to its Covid-19 vaccine, foreign minister Wang Yi told top regional diplomats, according to the Mexican government. In a virtual gathering, Mr Wang told his Latin American counterparts a vaccine developed by China would have universal access. He also presented a list of Chinese projects to fight the disease in the region, Mexico’s foreign affairs ministry said in a statement. Hong KongHong Kong reported 111 local virus cases on Thursday -- its second day of more than 100 local infections -- as the city scrambles to boost hospitalisation and testing capacity in the face of its worst outbreak ever. Two thirds of private demand for coronavirus tests from Hong Kong residents cannot be met as the city faces capacity bottlenecks, according to its largest private laboratory. Prenetics Ltd, along with other Hong Kong labs and hospitals, has beenoverloaded with people seeking virus tests since a new wave emerged 18 days ago, chief executive officer Danny Yeung said in an interview. Demand has swelled to as many as 20,000 a day from members of the public as the outbreak grows to over 700 local infections, he said.Europe Spanish tourism minister Reyes Maroto said a resurgence in coronavirus cases in Catalonia was coming under control and she hoped there would be no need for France to close the border.The Italian government will approve a new spending package, the third major cash injection since the start of the new coronavirus outbreak in the country, to try to prop up the economy.Ukraine will let spectators return for soccer matches up to a quarter of stadia capacity after a three-month pause.Russia reported 5,848 new Covid-19 infections in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 795,038, according to data from the government’s virus response center. There were 147 deaths, bringing total fatalities to 12,892, while 8,277 people recovered. Moscow reported 608 new infections, or 10.4 per cent of the daily total.British prime ministers Boris Johnson’s administration had no economic plan for a pandemic as coronavirus hit the UK in an “astonishing” failure of governance, a cross-party panel of lawmakers said. “Pandemic planning is the bread and butter of government risk planning, but we learn it was treated solely as a health issue, with no planning for the economic impacts,” the committee’s chairman said. “This meant that the economic strategy was of necessity rushed and reactive.” The government rejected that conclusion and said, with the crisis ongoing, this is not the right time to review its response.Africa and Middle EastTotal confirmed cases in Africa have passed 750,000, a Reuters tally of government and WHO data showed.South Africa reported a record 572 deaths from the coronavirus on Wednesday, almost tripling the previous daily high. The number of confirmed infections rose to 394,948 from 381,798 the day before, the department of health said in a statement. It gave no explanation for the surge in death numbers. So far 5,940 people have officially died from the virus in South Africa, according to the department.Israel’s parliament approved a Bill that allows the cabinet to declare a state of emergency and impose new restrictions with little to no parliamentary supervision. Lawmakers would have 24 hours to vet new regulations, which would automatically take effect in the case of no opposition. If the government deems the restrictions urgent, then they can take effect immediately. The Bill was passed amid a barrage of protests against the government’s handling of the crisis.Gazans are thronging beaches and crowding markets filled with holiday sweets and clothes as they prepare to celebrate Eid al-Adha largely free of restrictions.JapanAround 360 new coronavirus cases were found in Tokyo on Thursday, a record for a day, TV Asahi and other Japanese media reported, as a long holiday weekend began in Japan. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has told residents to avoid unnecessary trips outdoors as much as possible, after the city’s running total topped 10,000 and new cases nationwide hit a new daily record on Wednesday. Tokyo has over 3,800 cases so far this month, more than the previous peak in April when the city entered a state of emergency. Although Japan has suffered about 28,000 infections and more than 1,000 deaths, it has escaped the kind of explosive surge seen elsewhere. But recent signs of a spurt in infections in Japan, as well as other major economies, such as the United States, have prompted authorities to raise renewed alerts against the virus.IndonesiaIndonesia reported 1,906 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, bringing its total infections to 93,657, data from the country’s Covid-19 taskforce showed. The number of Covid-19 deaths in the Southeast Asian nation rose by 117 on Thursday to bring the total to 4,576, the data showed. –PA, Reuters, Bloomberg,  Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4311766.1595506006!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk s position makes trade deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier arrives wearing a face mask  at Europe House, headquarters of the EU Delegation to the UK, in London on Thursday.

Former US vice-president and now candidate for the presideny Joe Biden. Photograph: Drew AngererGetty ImagesThe Soviet Union used to alternate between bald leaders and ones with formidable hair. The US, which is seldom ruled by the smooth of pate, swings around a different axis. It seems to crave a breather after each high-drama president.The Richard Nixon years gave on to some water-treading under Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Ronald Reagan led to George HW Bush and the prelapsarian tranquillity of the 1990s. After the younger Bush and his still-simmering wars came Barack “No Drama” Obama. It follows that Donald Trump, the author of so much tumult, should prefigure a restful four years under Joe Biden. Moderate Republicans are counting on it. Not to impugn their principles, but they might be slower to say “Never Trump” if the alternative was as leftwing as Bernie Sanders or his Senate colleague Elizabeth Warren. Biden’s emergence as the Democratic candidate for the White House enabled their apostasy. What threat is there, after all, in a twice-elected vice-president, a voter for welfare reform, a clubbable bipartisan of the old Washington? What radical potential?More, perhaps, than in any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson. Biden is running some way to the left of his old boss, Obama, or of Bill Clinton before him. On healthcare, but also on housing, education and climate change abatement, he is a late-life convert to expansive federal government. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, and the public debts it has incurred, he proposed to raise taxes on higher earners. It is true that any politician can draw up a bold manifesto. What gives this one its promise – or, for conservatives, its menace – are the circumstances of the day. Such is their polling surge that Democrats now contemplate (“expect” is overdoing it) victories in once-daunting Senate races. Even with control of that chamber, no programme is assured passage. But without it, a President Biden would be reliant on – don’t laugh – Republican co-operation. A Democratic majority gives him a chance.Taxes on the richNor would the Senate be the only handmaid to his agenda. At 77, Biden will need a strong vice-president. Of the touted candidates, most are to his left. Even the exception, former UN ambassador Susan Rice, is not moderate so much as hard to place on domestic issues.If these institutional variables align, they will still not constitute the ultimate tailwind for his programme. That is public sentiment itself. The image of America as a land of masochistic self-reliance belies its taste for universal public services, healthcare reform and taxes on the rich. If Biden has changed, he has done so in step with his compatriots. As a proxy measure, consider that voters still place him much nearer the middle ground than Trump, even as they register that he has shuffled left.Biden as change-maker: it is still a jarring picture, somehow. But that makes it all the more likely to materialise.Of the three Democrat presidents who did most to build, entrench and expand the welfare state, none had seemed destined for anything of the kind. Franklin class-treachery. Harry Truman was a Roosevelt was a blue blood whose New Deal remains America’s noblest act of machine politician from the pragmatic Midwest. As for Johnson, progressives feared they were getting an unreconstructed vulgarian, not the Civil Rights Act and Medicare. It was not despite their outward pragmatism and their lack of leftist credentials that these men achieved reform. It was because of them. They were impossible to paint as extremists. This trick is not unique to US politics. Britain’s postwar prime minister Clement Attlee was such a parody of English diffidence that, when asked if he was an agnostic, he supposedly said: “I don’t know.” After six years in office, he had nationalised healthcare and major industries. No firebrand could have done it.Does Biden have a trace of these leaders’ skill? That he is on his third bid for the White House suggests not. What he does have is their seeming innocuousness. Bold policies can be smuggled under its cover. In that sense, Trump’s jibe at him – “Sleepy Joe” – is not just failing to land. It is misconceived in the first place.The more he is seen as a do-nothing grandpa, the more license Biden has to advance ideas that would have done for another candidate. Americans, if he wins, should not count on a quiet life. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Read more about the Donald Trump administrationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/23/09/demi-lovato-engaged.jpg","title":"demi lovato engaged max ehrich hailey bieber jessie j adam lambert","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Pop star shared the news with her 88.4\u0026nbspmillion Instagram followers on Thursday morningCelebrities have rushed to congratulate singer Demi Lovato on her engagement to Max Ehrich.Hailey Bieber, Jessie J and Adam Lambert are among the many celebrities who have congratulated the singer since Lovato announced the news on Thursday morning (23 July) via Instagram.Bieber (formerly Baldwin) expressed her excitement for the couple with a series of love heart and crying emojis, while Maroon 5’s frontman wrote: “Wow congrats!!!!!!!!!!”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSinger Jessie J added, “SO HAPPY FOR YOUUUU” and Avril Lavigne wrote: “Yay!!!!

Here is everything you need to know:\u0026nbspCovid-19 enforcement action taken against three Leicester textile firmsEnforcement action has been taken against three textile firms inspected in Leicester for breaching Covid-19 control measures, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has said.Inspectors have carried out 51 factory visits, including 34 spot-checks on textiles businesses.It issued enforcement notices at nine sites in total, of which three were for failures to apply adequate Covid-19 controls under health and safety law.The HSE said it had not found any cases where the situation was so bad that it would justify taking a prosecution.Multi-agency inspections were launched, following concerns over the welfare of workers at clothing factories in the city, amid claims of exploitation.The online fashion giant Boohoo has faced criticism following reports alleging workers in a Leicester factory making clothes for the firm were being paid as little as £3.50 an hour, in breach of the national minimum wage law.With retailers such as Next and Asos dropping its clothing from their websites, the fast fashion company has said it will investigate the claims and cut ties with any supplier it finds to have broken its code of conduct.The controversy in Leicester came as the city was subject to the UK\u0027s first ever local lockdown on June 29, due to the high rate of coronavirus infection.The HSE conducted 51 visits to premises in the city between May 1 and July 20, it said.Of those, 34 were targeted spot checks on textiles firms, while the remainder were in response to concerns raised by workers and the public.Scotland reports 16 new coronavirus casesScotland has recorded 16 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in a day.Speaking at the Scottish Government\u0027s coronavirus briefing, first minister Nicola Sturgeon\u0026nbspsaid 18,500 people have tested positive for Covid-19 north of the border.\u0026nbspShe added provisional figures indicate four of the new cases are in Lanarkshire and added there are now 24 cases linked to the outbreak at the Sitel call centre in the region, up from 20 yesterday.\u0026nbspNo deaths of people who tested positive for the virus have been recorded for a week running, meaning the toll remains at 2,491.Rise in number of people receiving home Covid-19 test result within 24 hoursSome 6.2 per cent\u0026nbspof people who took a Covid-19 test using a home test kit in the week ending July 15 received their result within 24 hours -

a so-called in-person test - has fallen for the second week in a row.Some 71.4 per cent of people received the result within 24 hours in the week ending 15 July, down from 87.7 per cent\u0026nbspin the week to 8 July and 90.7 per cent\u0026nbspin the week to 1 July.\u0026nbspPrime minister Boris Johnson last month pledged to get the results of all in-person tests back within 24 hours by the end of June.\u0026nbspHe told the House of Commons on 3 June he would get all tests turned around within 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that.Second Dublin construction site closes after worker tests positiveA second construction site in Dublin has had to close temporarily after a worker tested positive for Covid-19.The staff member was working on the East Quad site in Grangegorman, which is part of a development of two new buildings for students attending Technological University Dublin.It is understood the site has been closed so it can be deep cleaned.It comes after a construction site on Townsend Street in Dublin city centre was temporarily shut on Monday after it emerged a number of workers had been infected.The acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said more than 20 cases had been linked to the site so far and many other workers have been tested.The White House has closed two cafeterias after a worker tested positive for coronavirus.The eating areas\u0026nbsplocated inside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building\u0026nbspand the New Executive Office Building were both closed this week after the case was discovered, according to reports.It is not clear whether the person who contracted Covid-19 was a cafeteria worker or a White House official.White House workers have reportedly been told to stay home if they show symptoms of the virus or feel unwell, but\u0026nbspthat they do not need to self-quarantine, according to the\u0026nbspNew York Times.\u0026nbspTest and trace fails to contact more than 30,000 peopleSince the launch of the government\u0027s test and trace programme, 169,546 close contacts of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 have been reached through the tracing system and asked to self-isolate.This is 83.6 per cent out of a total of 202,781 people identified as close contacts.\u0026nbspThe remaining 33,235 people (16.4 per cent) were identified as close contacts, but were not reached.The weekly figures show that 77.9 per cent\u0026nbspof close contacts were reached in the week ending 15 July, up from 72.0 per cent\u0026nbspin the previous week, but down on the 90.7 per cent\u0026nbspreached in the first week of test and trace (week ending 3 June).Packs of face coverings will be available for purchase near the front of Tesco stores for anyone who has forgotten to bring one.It is understood customers will be able to open them and add to their basket to purchase later.United States \u0027recording 2,600 new cases every hour\u0027US\u0026nbspcoronavirus cases are approaching 4 million, with more than 2,600 new cases every hour on average, the highest rate in the world, according to a Reuters tally.Infections in the United States have rapidly accelerated since the first case was detected on 21 January.It took the country 98 days to reach 1 million cases. It took another 43 days to reach 2 million and then 27 days to reach 3 million. It has only taken 16 days to reach 4 million at a rate of 43 new cases a minute.The federal government, state governors and city leaders have often clashed over the best way to tackle the pandemic, leading to a confusing patchwork of rules on issues like mask wearing in public and when businesses can open.President Donald Trump recently shifted his tone. He had previously been reluctant to wear a face covering himself but this week encouraged Americans to wear masks and recently appeared in public for the first time with a face covering.Of the 20 countries with the biggest outbreak, the United States ranks second for cases per capita, at 120 infections per 10,000 people, only exceeded by Chile.With over 143,000 deaths, or 4.4 fatalities per 10,000 people, the United States ranks sixth globally for the highest deaths per capita. It is exceeded by the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Chile and France.Government confirms public must wear face masks in sandwich shopsPeople will need to wear a face covering in sandwich shops in England under new regulations due to come into force on Friday.The Department of Health and Social Care has confirmed face coverings will be needed in shops such as Pret A Manger\u0026nbspif people intend to take their food and coffee away.If they sit down to eat or drink, they will be able to remove their face covering in that area.It is likely takeaway outlets will fall under the same criteria.A Department of Health spokesman said: From Friday 24 July\u0026nbspit will be mandatory to wear a face covering in shops and supermarkets, as is currently the case on public transport.If a shop or supermarket has a cafe or a seating area to eat and drink, you can remove your face covering in that area.The regulations, which are enforceable by the police, are due to be set out on Thursday afternoon.The same exemptions as for public transport will apply, with children under 11 and people with breathing problems not required to wear a covering.Anyone who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment or disability is also exempt.Hong Kong reports daily record of new casesHong Kong has reported a daily record of 118 new coronavirus cases,\u0026nbspincluding 111 locally transmitted cases, adding to a deluge of new infections that have hit the global financial hub in the past two weeks.Hong Kong extended strict social distancing measures on Wednesday as authorities reported 105 locally transmitted infections.Since late January more than 2,000 people have been infected in Hong Kong, 14 of whom have died.Authorities have warned the city faces a critical period in containing the virus.Authorities on Wednesday also said they were extending the period that non-essential civil servants would work from home until 2 August.Health secretary Sophia Chan said the government was asking citizens to be patient and stay at home as much as possible.Tokyo sees highest daily count of new casesThe city of Tokyo announced a record 366 new daily coronavirus cases, exceeding 300 for the first time.It comes as Japan begins a four-day weekend with many people joining a tourism promotion campaign\u0026nbspthe government is pushing despite concerns of a new wave of infections nationwide.The number of daily cases in Tokyo had fallen to just several in late May after the government ended a national state of emergency but have climbed steadily since late June, with the number tripling in the first three weeks of July.Tokyo now has 10,420 confirmed cases, including 327 deaths.The Tokyo Olympics 2020 would have begun tomorrow, but the opening ceremony has been pushed back to 23 July 2021 because of the pandemic.Governor\u0026nbspYuriko Koike said:\u0026nbspPlease be mindful of your actions and do your utmost not to get infected, and not to infect others.Ms Koike on Wednesday asked residents to stay home as much as possible during the long weekend, even though prime minister Shinzo Abe\u0027s government has gone ahead with a Go To tourism promotion campaign that excludes Tokyo for now to help the badly hit tourism industry.Until recently, officials have said most cases were limited to younger people linked to nightlife entertainment districts, but experts at a Tokyo task force meeting on Wednesday said infections have spread to older people and to regular homes, workplaces and restaurants.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is not some kind of competition – this is our nation’s lives and livelihoods at stake.”The report called for more transparency in the government’s decision-making, stating that it has been slow “on important issues”, such as the NHS Test and Trace programme. It also criticised the “stop-start” approach to school closures, stating the risk of “major harm to many children’s life chances, exacerbating already-existing inequalities”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But despite a pandemic being identified as the government’s top non-malicious risk, it failed to stock up in advance.“The Department of Health and Social Care was not focused enough on the challenge of how to identify need in the care sector and ensure supply of PPE,” it said.No help for millions excluded from Covid-19 support, says chancellorIt was recommended that the Cabinet Office reviews its “crisis command structures” to ensure any future or long-term decisions are “properly informed and coordinated effectively” throughout the government.The committee also called for greater involvement with businesses regarding their needs and said the Treasury should engage with key sectors and industries to “develop bespoke support measures aimed at helping those businesses through the ongoing effects of the pandemic”.It added: “Central government has not given local authorities the clarity or support they need over longer-term funding.”A government spokesperson said in response to the PAC report: “As the public would expect, we regularly test our pandemic plans – allowing us to rapidly respond to this unprecedented crisis and protect the NHS.“It was clear that Coronavirus would affect all areas of the country, that’s why we immediately put in place an unprecedented initial economic support package for jobs and business worth £160 billion. The next stage in our economic response will make a further £30 billion available to ensure all areas of the UK bounce back.“We’re providing over £100 million to support children to learn at home and a £1 billion Covid catch up fund will directly tackle the impact of lost teaching time, as schools and colleges welcome children back in September. In addition, we’ve committed almost £28 billion to local areas to support councils, businesses and communities.“Over £3 billion of additional winter funding will be available immediately to the NHS to prepare for the risk of a second peak and we continue to work around the clock to ensure PPE is delivered as quickly as possible to those on the frontline.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

The MPs suggest the Treasury should extend the coronavirus furlough scheme for affected businesses until mass gatherings are once again permitted.July and August are key in terms of organising Christmas seasons, the report said, which means “continued uncertainty about reopening could have devastating consequences far beyond the end of this year”.Mr Knight added the UK is “witnessing the biggest threat to our cultural landscape in a generation”, claiming: “The failure of the government to act quickly has jeopardised the future of institutions that are part of our national life and the livelihoods of those who work for them.”“Our report points to a department that has been treated as a ‘Cinderella’ by government when it comes to spending, despite the enormous contribution DCMS sectors make to the economy and job creation.” Reopening theatres for Christmas pantomimes ‘challenging’Referring to the announcement by the culture secretary Oliver Dowden for a cash injection into the struggling industry, Mr Knight went on: “We can see the damaging effect that has had on the robustness and ability of these areas to recover from the Covid crisis. The £1.57bn support is welcome but for many help has come too late. “We urge the government to act on our recommendations, to recognise the value these sectors provide and imagine how much bleaker the outcome for all without their survival.”Unveiling the plan earlier in July, Boris Johnson said the money would help safeguard the arts for “future generations” and ensure businesses could stay afloat – despite still not being able to open their doors.A DCMS spokesperson said: “We disagree with the committee. We have worked with urgency day in, day out since the start of the pandemic in providing support for our sectors and on plans to reopen them safely.“Thousands of organisations and hundreds of thousands of jobs working across culture, the arts, sport and tourism have been saved by furloughing and loan schemes. Hospitality and tourism firms have also been helped by a year’s business rates holiday and a £4bn reduction in VAT.“Our £1.57bn investment is the largest ever one-off cash injection into culture in this country. We have also worked with our arms-length bodies on additional emergency packages and provided billions in support to charities to help those most in need. We will respond in detail to the select committee’s report in due course.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Quick-witted, smart, self-deprecating, incredibly likeable and a bit odd-looking. A man who gives hope to fans, both through his career and marriage to Abbey Clancy.Then a double calamity struck. Euro  was cancelled and instead of ­canning the project the BBC pressed on with SOS, shackling it with a hostage-to-fortune title and all sorts of baggage and “other stuff” the show could have done ­without as well.Aside from a garden centre set and enormous table, around which Churchill could’ve signed the Yalta agreement, the baggage came in human form: Crouchy’s former team-mates, The Horne Section studio band, a guest comedian and, of course, Maya, who provided my series highlight when she got dangerously side-tracked by the host’s leisure and tourism qualication.“I don’t want to sound silly or anything,” said Maya, carefully setting her own trap, “But what is a GVNQ ”“It’s a GNVQ.” Obviously.As awkwardly as hosts and guests have all gelled, though, the thing that’s really torpedoed this show has been the other stuff. Those outside broadcasts and studio features that were meant to fill the ­football gap, but didn’t.Two regulars were a chino-clad irritant called Fast Dad, who competed against the host to win football memorabilia for a viewer and “Peter’s Extreme Retirement”, which included all the ideas Alan ­Partridge would’ve thought a bit naff, like water-skiing with Joe Cole.The game not even Crouchy’s GNVQ could help him understand, though, was a VAR-related pun called Very Accurate Rhythm.On Saturday it involved Mo Gilligan playing keepie-uppie to The Horne ­Section’s version of Hit Me Baby One More Time. In previous weeks, however, it was Tinie Tempah and Katherine Ryan having a go at swingball and Jimmy Carr playing Mel C at table tennis.There’s a scoreboard as well, yet no sense of what the hell’s going on here, other than the fact that not a single ­person at the BBC knows how to produce light entertainment.If they did, one of them would have given Peter Crouch the two words of prime-time advice he desperately needed to hear. Don’t. Swear.They didn’t, though. Crouchy and his mates swore like he was presenting a late-night E show and so ended up with an E-sized audience of about one ­million. That’s the reason you never see masters of the light entertainment art, Ant  Dec, dropping the F-bomb.In its youth-driven madness, the BBC might think this is a good thing but it alienates the people who actually pay their wages and has direct consequences for Crouch who, before this started, I thought, could have become a ­Saturday night staple. Now  Mystery guest round on A Question Of Sport, tops. That’s how he’s been coping without the football, Maya.And ex-Celtic manager John Barnes enlivening ITV’s Stephen Lawrence: Has Britain Changed  debate by telling the audience it needed to “elevate people like me and people like Barack Obama”, asthe former US President had ever worked with anyone of the magnitude of Jackie McNamara and Regi Blinker.You’re far too modest, John.Celebrity Snoop Dogs, Kevin McCloud: “It’s the much-loved Martine McCutcheon.” The One Show, Amol Rajan: “Today’s first guest is a man of many talents, Nick Knowles.”Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer, Maya Jama to the host: “God loves a trier.”Loves  He’s sent down a plague of locusts for less than SOS.ANYONE who watched last night’s episode of the landmark BBC series Once Upon A Time In Iraq is unlikely to forget it in a hurry.The story of the  invasion is grimly familiar, but what sets this show apart are the testimonies from its eyewitnesses.None of them wastes words. All of them are mesmerising.Two, though, still managed to stand out from the others.The first was a darkly funny Iraqi called Waleed Nesy who, before he became a journalist’s translator, was pro-war and fronted Baghdad’s only state-approved heavy metal band which, I’m desperately hoping, were called Black Sabba’ath.The other was ferociously bright US army officer Lieutenant-Colonel Nate Sassaman, “a charismatic leader of men” who was hoping to bring peace, democracy and lots of other empty promises to the country until he entered his first local medical centre and: “I’m telling you, the woman running it  She was as hard as a woodpecker’s lips.”Both were damaged by the catastrophe that unfolded and, in the case of Sassaman, helped cause, but they somehow retained their humanity, honesty and sense of humour, which made their testimony all the more astonishing.Like all great war documentaries, Once Upon A Time In Iraq was also prepared to let silence tell the story when the brutality or stupidity became too overwhelming.They made an exception for Waleed, though, when, six weeks into the invasion, President George W Bush boldly declared: “Mission accomplished.”“Mission accomplished  Oh yeah  . . . SERIOUSLY ”Three more episodes will tell you very graphically how well that worked out and they’re as good as anything you’ve watched all year.INCIDENTALLY, I’m grateful to This Morning hosts Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes for revealing blind Celebrity MasterChef contestant Amar Lat measured liquids with “talking jugs”.Which, by a million-to-one coincidence, was also ITV’s original working title for Loose Women.My Strange Addiction: “Eating mattresses can lead to liver damage, intestinal blockage and even death.”But on the plus side, it won’t leave you bed-ridden.Emile Heskey: “When your back’s against the wall, it’s easy to lie down.”Jeff Stelling: “This game will be over when the referee blows the final whistle.”And Chris Kamara: “Three points is another point on the board.”BY the way,you haven’t ever seen Chernobyl, one of the greatest TV dramas ever made, Friday, pm, Sky Atlantic, is your chance.No further excuses will be accepted.WITH no little air of self-congratulation, last week, Celebrity MasterChef welcomed its first ever blind contestant, “travel presenter” Amar Lat, who arrived with a helper and his own super power.“I’ve started to hear the food talking to me,” he explained. “It’s almost like it’s communicating to me and it’s saying . . .”“Don’t worry, Amar. The BBC won’t chuck you out first. It’d look bad.”As good fortune would have it, he didn’t need to worry too much as it was the worst line-up of the series and included Gethin Jones, playing to the camera, rapper Lady Leshurr, whose speciality seemed to be “in-flight meals” and Alan Partridge star Felicity “Lynn Benfield” Montagu, who served up a salad for the guest judges that looked like a Haitian voodoo rattle.The real fall guy, though, appeared to be Jeff Brazier who, at the first challenge, was tugging away at a string of garlic for a good ten seconds before he twigged. “Ah. It’s a decoration. It’s made of polystyrene.”Those people who cry at absolutely everything, of course, were quick to let everyone  know Amar’s eventual progression to the semi-final made them “cry”.I thought the highlight of the week, however, came at the end of the pair’s dessert challenge when the judges’ comments led Amar to ask: “Are you two fat ” and Gregg Wallace replied: “Are you familiar with Jean-Claude Van Damme ”“Yes.”Then get someone to talk you through his voiceover on Minions: The Rise Of Gru.The resemblance is uncanny.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We knew it cracked down on all domestic opposition. We knew of the way in which they were undercutting the economies of the West.But not until the spread of the Wuhan virus did so many people come to realise how untrustworthy the Chinese leadership is.Now, every day brings more bad news about China. It isn’t because China is doing any-thing new. It is because China has caught the world’s attention.Not in a good way.Just consider the events of recent days.The Chinese government’s mistreatment of its Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang has been known about for years.The Muslim minority group, who regard themselves as closer to Central Asian countries — their language is related to Turkish — have long been in the government’s sights.Armed guardsFor years the Chinese Communist Party has had Xinjiang under its version of special measures.Claiming the one-time independent state, which borders eight countries, constitutes a special security risk, the communists have had the people there under mass surveillance.Even before the recent mass imprisonment, they have had them subjected to forced labour.In recent years they have subjected the entire population to compulsory birth control to try to reduce the size of the population.But for years the world’s attention was not focused on this.We all had troubles of our own to look to.So the Chinese authorities got away with putting perhaps as many as one million Uighur people in what are basically concentration camps — places where these people are meant to be “re-educated” and otherwise “corrected”.Now, drone footage has surfaced which shows shackled, blindfolded prisoners in the province being marched on to trains by rows of armed guards.The scenes are awful.As our Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, rightly said at the weekend, they are “reminiscent of something we have not seen for a very long time”.He is right.Yet when the Chinese Ambassador to our country was asked about this at the weekend, he pretended to have no idea what the footage was.He even tried to ert attention by asking his inter- viewer whether he had ever himself been to the charming province in question.But we are not as easily distracted by China as we used to be. Every day brings fresh causes.First, we had China’s appalling behaviour in Hong Kong, breaking its agreements with the UK and cracking down on the local population.Then last week came our Government’s decision to remove Chinese firm Huawei from any involvement in Britain’s G network.Huawei is basically a Chinese government agency and it would have been a serious security breach to allow it to control all our internet communications. Or to develop a back door for looking into them.Then a number of senior Conservatives warned that social media app TikTok is “as much of a threat” to Britain as Huawei.That may sound funny to parents whose children are addicted to it.For most of us, the app is just a source of amusement or bemusement.Depending on your age.But whatever your reaction to it, a growing number of people believe Chinese tech-nologies like TikTok are not safe. Because TikTok’s parent company is ByteDance, a Chinese firm founded in .Of course, the company claims to be independent, as all such firms do, but in China major firms are not independent as they are in Britain or other free societies.Critics insist TikTok could easily be used by hostile forces to harvest information from, and otherwise target, all those who use it.Of course, all of this has brought a degree of sabre-rattling from Beijing.China’s leaders have got used to telling everyone  what to do.As they spread their financial wings in recent decades, countries like ours were very keen to enjoy the benefits.Universities in the UK repeatedly took money from China. Money with strings attached.But money that some of our greedier universities thought was free. Only later learning otherwise.Naturally, the turnaround of recent months has been badly received in Beijing.Its ambassadors and state media have spent recent days pretending it is Britain that is the untrustworthy partner.They are wrong.We are not inconsistent or unfair. We are simply a country that has begun to wake up to a threat.Like the rest of the world. And not a moment too soon.Jaguar Land Rover builds cars for them under a joint venture with Chery Automobile. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has , employees in China across several manufacturing sites, as well as an innovation centre and a ­campus.So as tensions ramp up after the decision to remove Huawei from the UK’s G network, Britain should remember it, too, has aces to play. Most notably tech and skills.To learn about these is why so many Chinese students come to our universities. It is the same reason why state-owned China General Nuclear Power is a one-third partner in the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.It will have a front-row seat to the latest tech as China prepares to build around  reactors of its own.Saying no to Chinese firms is not to be taken lightly.There are around , Chinese companies that do business in the UK. The largest  employ , people.But let’s not forget they need us too.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Right now the range of possibilities is from very early success through to we never get a vaccine against COVID-. What weve got with the Oxford result is clear proof that that vaccine produces a really good immune response in humans. It is very encouraging indeed. Im now cautiously optimistic that this vaccine may work. Were taking those financial risks to run the programmes as fast as we can. Weve already managed to secure  million doses of future supply of the Oxford vaccine.My best estimates are thatthis continues to run with the success that we have had so far, it would not be unreasonable to think that we will be getting some doses of that vaccine this side of Christmas. The UK has also signed deals for options on two other vaccines. When you get to the point where youve got a vaccine concept thats reasonable, then the success rate is typically about ten per cent. And what that tells you is that, to be sure that youre going to get a vaccine, you need multiple shots on goal. You’ve got to back more than one horse, and the UK Government is doing that. We are expecting to host five or six big vaccine trials in the UK in the autumn and yesterday we launched a website to allow the public to register their interest to take part in the trial. We are hoping to have , people per trial, so up to , participants. We’re not looking just for -year-olds, but people from a range of backgrounds and comorbidities. Im a glass half full man. Im cautiously optimistic that by late spring next year there will be several vaccines that will have made it. My confidence is increasing week by week with the news that comes through.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He seems fine.” Seriously Let’s hope this was just an attempt at media distraction and that, behind the scenes, he and other influential friends are telling Kanye the truth he so badly needs to hear — that he needs serious, prolonged treatment for his mental health, and fast.And , like so many famous people, he’s surrounded by “yes men” who put profits before their clients’ health, then they too need to support his we and family in their bid to get him treatment.It won’t save his presidential chances, but it might just save his le.JOHNNY Depp reportedly referred to Magic Mike star Channing Tatum as “potato-head”.A hot potato though, right SHOW me the boy of seven and I’ll show you the man.Fellow pupils who attended the private Durham School with Dominic Cummings describe him as isive, argumentative and “contemptuous” of his peers, with a look on his face that suggested: “I know better, I’m tolerating you.”A description that will no doubt sound familiar to the entire Cabinet.

And so, consequently, we have gravitated towards the nostalgic food brands that remind us of that time.Though it has to be said that The Bloke’s Heinz Mushroom And Bacon Toast Topper he purchased back in  is a step too far and remains untouched.He was stopped by Border Force teams.Either that or, just like the rest of us, he hired it for an hour and, a few minutes in, drted aimlessly after becoming paralysed with boredom.ONLINE dating frauds have soared by  per cent as con artists exploit loneliness in lockdown then ask to borrow money.The most vulnerable targets were women aged  to .With this in mind, here is my cut-out-and-keep guide to hopefully minimise the chances of this happening to you. If he tells you he’s a spy then he almost certainly isn’t.If he says he’s an airline pilot, only believe it when you see him sitting in a cockpit in full unorm.If he claims all his money is “stuck in Panama”, he’s penniless and after your cash.And finally,he goes incommunicado for several days and claims his phone broke, he’s probably been away with his we and four kids.You have been warned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As long as they are working from home, they are contributing to this country’s problems in three separate ways. The first, and in some ways the most obvious, is that the services they provide are not as good as they should be. I remember fondly that when I was Immigration minister ten years ago, the Passport Service, which in its time had been a national disgrace, won awards for being a model public service.It was quick, flexible and customer friendly.All that has been thrown away under lockdown.There are no appointments in person any more, and I have seen reports that some passports are taking  days to be issued. More than a million passports have expired since March, soyou want to venture abroad next month you may have to be very lucky.If travelling is dficult, driving is not much easier.Anyonewho needs to renew a driving licence is stuck in a long and growing queue.At the other end of the age range, taking your driving test means waiting weeks or months. None of this is good enough in a country aching to get back to normal.The second reason why civil servants should be back at their desks as long as it is safe is that they are often the economic heartbeat of parts of our big cities.Whitehall in London is the most obvious example, but in other cities the public sector is also hugely important for economic activity.Shops, pubs and sandwich bars are open again buttheir customers are miles away they may as well shut their doors once more.As the unlocking has progressed, every MP has been lobbied hard by the sectors who have felt left behind.Gradually the second wave businesses — the nail bars and gyms — are getting their way. But so many of them rely on their location to succeed, and that location works because there are people whose offices are nearby.Empty offices are a death knell for nearby businesses. Footfall is key.The third reason is the most subtle, but perhaps the most important. It is that Government offices need to set an example to the rest of the country.If a private sector employee is wondering whether toto the office, and a neighbour who works for the Government is cheerfully planning to work from home indefinitely, the obvious question arises: “Why should I start commuting again ”Partly for reasons of safety and partly for reasons of convenience, many people have found working from home suits them.This is especially true over the summer, whenyou have a garden it is better to be there two minutes after you stop work than in a sweaty train.What this has come to mean, though, is second-class public services and the throttling of business.It is time for the civil service to set an example.It has had months to make its offices safe, and we have seen the ingenuity of pubs, restaurants and bars in doing the same in much less time, and sometimes with a clientele that will be much less disciplined.So safe offices should now be filling up again, with workers ending those backlogs and restoring the vitality to our cities.Above all they should be sending the signal that Britain can take big steps back towards normal le.A day in the office will mean our streets and shops come back to le.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You must vote Leave in that referendum.”I said to him: “Excuse me, sorry for asking, but are you a Russian ”He looked aghast and said: “Nyet! Why would you think that ”And I said: “Because you speak funny, you have borscht on your tie and you’re glowing, in a radioactive manner, slightly.”He went off around the pub saying the same thing to everyone . Later, I saw him with a bottle of vodka in one hand doing that dance where you crouch down and kick your legs out and shout “ha!” every so often. I wandered up. “Are you SURE you’re not a Russian ”There’s vodka dribbling down his chin and he smells of piroshki dumplings and isotopes. “Nyet! I am Englyishman. My name is Jyohn Smeeth.Definitely not Russian, definitely not KGB, my frent.”“Oh, OK,” I said, “No worries, good night.”“Dosvedanya, toich,” he replied.OK, that didn’t quite happen. But the remainers have got it into their heads that something like it did. We all voted Leave because the Russians interfered in our referendum. Meddled with our democratic process. Which is why we should stop leaving and have another vote.The allegation is that the Russkies tried to persuade us to vote leave by spreading  news around.What  news was that  That the European Union is an authoritarian bureaucracy run by pygmies from Luxembourg  That the EU wanted ever-closer political control over our country That we spent enormous sums of money keeping gibbering oafs like Jean Claude Juncker in office, while subsidising the useless states of Europe I don’t knowspecial agents Ivan and Dmitri were putting that stuff around, but I was well aware of the fact long beforethey were.Is there anything anyone can point to which suggests that the Russkies had an effect  There’s an allegation that they tried to ensure that the Scots voted for independence from the UK. And we should all vote for Jeremy Corbyn in the  election. Not hugely successful meddling operations, then, were they The thing about the alleged Brexit meddling is that it plays into the same narrative the remainers have been peddling for four years. We were all thick, us leavers. We voted Leave because we were DUPED. First by Boris and Nigel Farage. And now by the devilish Russians. Too dense to understand we were being conned, we voted Leave.Looking at the EU today, I’ve never been happier that we voted to get the hell out, incidentally.I have no doubt the Russians meddle in our affairs. I very much hope our own cyber spies are doing the same thing to them. I know the CIA is up to all sorts of tricks.Russia is not a very pleasant country right now and we should complain when it crosses the line — which it does, every month or so. But the idea that it had a decisive effect in our Brexit referendum is an insult to all those of us who thought long and hard and then voted Leave.The remainers can’t get over that we did so. They cannot bear to be defied. Tough. It wasn’t the Russians wot won it. It was us, the ordinary people of this fine country.And we’re still very glad we did.COVID has been good for some people. A lot of better- off people have been able to save loads of money, for example. And they don’t come much better off than the boss of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.Jeff has seen his income rise by a very agreeable £billion. That’s kind of enough money to buy France. So how about this, Jeffrey How about you get your company to pay the right amount of income tax in countries where you make so much money, such as the UK Last year Amazon did £billion worth of business in the UK – and paid £million in tax. That’s a tax rate, then, of two per cent.Not right, is it GOB on a very strange stick Janet Street Porter has been screeching about men. Again.She was having a go at Prince Andrew. Well, fair enough. The bloke is neither use nor ornament. And may soon be up to his neck in legal problems.I agree with the first part of what the toothy old harridan had to say. “Prince Andrew has no skills, no mates and no redeeming features.”Yup, largely agree, pet. But then she went on: “And so many modern middle-agedblokes are like that. That’s why women have drinks parties with their mates on Zoom, binge watch Netflix . . . and only laugh when they’re talking to gay men or their girlfriends.”She ended up by saying that men were becoming “redundant”.Can you imagine the outrageI had a go at a spectacularly useless woman – Janet Street Porter, for example.And then said most women were like her and that women in general are becoming redundant Ooh, there’d be howls of outrage.A LECTURER who said Jewish people had high intelligence has been sacked.Stephen Lamonby also said that Germans were good at engineering.

And Germans – well, they have been good at engineering, haven’t they Engineering Daily ranked countries in order of their prow-ess in the field. Germany came top. The magazine said: “Germany has long stood the test of time to emerge as a champion in the engineering field, reputed for its technical universities, internships and perhaps a culture and an economy that rewards engineering skills with both prestige and career growth.”Telling the truth, then, can now cost you your job.

The parents said Lucer meant “bringer of light”.And while technically they might be right, it also means “that nasty, scaly, red b who lives in Hell”.A spokesman for Satan said yesterday: “I’m delighted by the Sheldons’ choice of name for their child. Lucer is a much maligned and misunderstood entity.“We will keep a close eye on the little mite and ensure that one day he rules the world, ha ha ha ha ha . . . ”I WAS sitting in a restaurant up here on Teesside.

He ordered a DOUBLE.You could almost hear his heart saying to him: “Look mate. Speaking on behalf of all of your bodily organs.

Yup, amigo, it’s the dreaded “second spike” we’ve all been worried about.But people from the UK can still travel to Spain unhindered. And Spaniards can travel here without restriction.The Government says it will look at inidual countries and,need be, take them off the “air-bridge” list. Here’s my suggestion, Boris. Do it NOW.Quarantine for everyone arriving from Spain. Don’t make the same mistake you made in March. Back then there were NO restrictions on people from Covid hotspots – .million people arrived here up until lockdown.And that’s why we have one of the worst virus death rates in the world. Be quicker off the mark, Boris.

Otherwise it is too dficult to make sure this data is secure.“So we are working with like-minded democracies across the world to implement this central concept of trusted vendors, trusted networks.”In his first trip to the UK since the coronavirus crisis, Mr Pompeo said countries had to stand up to China.He admitted “confronting evil is hard”, but insisted “freedom loving democracies” like the UK had to work with the US to “convince the Chinese Communist Party to behave”.Speaking a week after the UK barred Chinese firm Huawei from future involvement in G networks over security fears, he added: “We all know Communists, right “We know what authoritarian regimes do. We know the nature of this ideology.“The way in which freedom-loving democracies behave — whether in the military space, the diplomatic space, the commercial space — the Chinese Communist Party simply isn’t behaving in that way. We also know there are hundreds of millions of Chinese people who are demanding that they continue to grow their economy and are looking for things that matter to them.“And that’s why I’ve always talked about this being the Chinese Communist Party driving this bad behaviour.”Mr Pompeo told how, while President Trump may have made China a priority, he could understand why other countries had been slow to take on a regime so quick to “punish” anyone who annoyed them.Mr Pompeo said: “Confronting evil is hard. It requires communicating to your people. There are real costs on the nations that confront it.”Previous US leaders — Republican and Democratic alike — had been affected by China’s belligerence but “just weren’t prepared to admit” to the problem. He said they had believed once China opened up commercially it leaders would conform to international norms, but added: “That simply didn’t happen.”The latest evidence was the way Chinese officials had silenced, or “disappeared”, its scientists who tried to raise the alarm over Covid-. The Secretary of State said: “The world saw it four-square with the massive cover up that took place with the Wuhan virus.“The world is still suffering. We have people dying all across the world, each and every day. And you still have a cover up that is continuing. No nation should permit China to get away with this.”The US has been highly critical of the World Health Organisation. On Tuesday Mr Pompeo even told MPs director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had been “bought” by the Chinese government.But he told The Sun he still hoped a WHO inquiry would uncover the truth.Its secrecy and deceit over Covid has cost countless lives worldwide, including here. Its treatment of Uighur Muslims is evil, its Hong Kong betrayal appalling, its cyber-warfare indefensible.It is too early for us to ban TikTok. But the Tories must ensure the Chinese social media giant is not handing over users’ details to its totalitarian government.National security must trump economic concerns, as Boris Johnson accepts.Compare that with the EU’s response: To sign a bumper trade deal with Beijing.Brussels cares less about safety and human rights than about flogging its wine.Turning to issues in his own country amid Black Lives Matter campaigns, Mr Pompeo said: “There are people who choose to think that America’s founding was somehow fraudulent, because of the terrible tragedy of slavery. But our founders accounted for a country that could continue to reinvent its capacity to extend these rights to a broader set of people — to African Americans, to women.“We have done that and our system has proven resilient. If we forget these core rights we are at risk of floundering. If we do that, I believe that the American way of le is absolutely at risk. I don’t think that will happen.

There is very little research about the mid-term effect of coronavirus.”Earlier this month, members of staff at working at the coronavirus ward of the Wolfson Medical Center in Holon, Israel, who had contracted the virus were found to be antibody free.That led to concerns that some recovered COVID- patients may not have any immunity.“It is worrying [to consider] why they don’t have antibodies,” Margarita Mashavi, head of internal medicine at Wolfson Medical Center in Holon.Second positive tests are a phenomenon that is still yet to be fully understood and scientists are unsurepeople can catch Covid- twice.From what is known about viruses, people who have had Covid- already should develop a level of immunity.There are numerous accounts of people testing positive twice but doctors say there is no as yet clear evidence of widespread vulnerability to reinfection.Back in April it emerged that patients in China were testing positive again for the disease  days after being given the all clear, leaving doctors baffled.There have been recent studies that appear to show antibody levels dropping off after two to three months, while others show they stable and even increase, the Washington Post reports.Some people could be suffering from a re-emergence of the same illness from virus that had been lurking somewhere in their body.Their positive Covid- tests could have been  positives - a result that shows you have something when you havent.That happened in South Korean when hundreds who tested positive for Covid- even after they recoveredThe countrys infectious-disease experts said that the positive test results were likely caused by flaws in the testing process.

But in any shop, you do need a mask. So,youre going up to the counter in Pret to buy takeaway that is a shop.But Prime Minister Boris Johnsons official spokesman later gave an alternative explanation.We will be publishing the full guidance shortly but my understanding is that it wouldnt be mandatoryyou went in, for example, to a sandwich shop in order to get a takeaway to wear a face covering, he said.The contradiction came after Michael Gove, who had earlier sparked confusion by suggesting face coverings would not be compulsory, was photographed uncovered in Pret A Manger despite insisting it was basic good manners to wear a mask.Just minutes earlier International Development Secretary Liz Truss had left the same shop in Westminster wearing a face covering.On Wednesday night, businesses claimed they had still not received clarity on the guidance.Pret said it had still not been told whether masks would be required for its customers.McDonalds has already announced it will reopen around  dine-in restaurants across the UK this week, with customers able to place their orders on a mobile app.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This means city centres in the capital could be deserted for some time which would be a knock-on effect for the cafes, pubs and shops that rely on office staffto keep their shutters open.Footfall in commuter cities such as Basildon in Essex, Wigan and Chatham have appeared to bounce back as lockdown restrictions have eased.Centre for Cities Director of Policy and Research Paul Swinney said: Londons size and the ability of many of its office-based workers to continue to work from home are likely to be the main reasons why it is having one of the slowest recoveries from lockdown.Having smaller shares of private car owners is likely to be an additional factor given that many people are still reluctant to use public transport to travel into the centre.Mr Swinney told the MailOnline: Low city centre footfall is very damaging to the hospitality and service sectors that depend on custom from office workers. Shops, restaurants and pubs are unlikely to see ato normal levels of custom until peopleto their offices.The data was updated on July , after non-essential businesses and pubs and restaurants were given the green light to reopen.

Its not the first time that the state-run broadcaster has banned the showing of competitive sport. National Basketball Associationcoverage was dropped after the general manager of Houston Rockets Daryl Morey tweeted in support of pro-democracy forces in October ,Bloomberg reported.The Premier League blackout was a response to the UK governments decision to ban Huawei on July .From January next year British telecom companies will be banned from buying Huawei equipment - and the companys tech will be stripped out of the UKs G network by  because of security fears. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian threatened to take any post-Brexit trade deal with China off the table because of the decision.Its a litmus test for the direction where the UK markets would go after Brexit, and whether the UK businesses in China will be provided with an open, fair and non-discriminate environment, he said.The comments threatened the security of leading UK companies which have operations in China including BP,  Diageo, Glaxosmithkline, InterContinental Hotels and Jaguar Land Rover.The Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming tweeted that it was disappointing and the wrong decision by the UK.It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, far and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.The UK government decided to ban Huawei after US sanctions on China meant key components would no longer be able to be made with American equipment.

The PM stressed it was the force of the UK which had helped see the nation through the coronavirus crisis. He said: What we have seen throughout this crisis is the strength of the Union in dealing with crucial, crucial things, supporting people through the furlough scheme the work of the army and the armed services in testing and moving people around putting another.Mr Johnson added that the question of Scottish independence had already been settled and those hoping for another go at a vote would have to wait a generation.He said: We had a referendum in , it was decisive, it was, I think by common consent, it was a once in a generation event. When askedhe thought Scotland couldnt survive on its own during the coronavirus crisis he said he thinks the union is a fantastically strong institution. He continued: Its helped our country through thick and thin and is very, very valuable in terms of the support weve been able to give peoplein all corners of the UK. We had a referendum on breaking up the union I think six years ago.  That is not a generation by any computation and I think what people really want is see our whole country coming back strongly and coming together. He flew into Kirkwall Airport before heading to the first in a series of engagements.But the PMs attempt to galvanise support for the Union was met with a frosty welcome to Scotland from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Ms Sturgeon accused Mr Johnson of using the coronavirus crisis as a political weapon and said no one should be crowing or feel satisfied when there were almost , people in the UK dead from the pandemic. She said this lunchtime: I dont think any of us should be trying to use Covid and the pandemic and the crisis situation we have faced and continue to face as some kind of political campaign tool. This is a pandemic that has taken the lives of more than , people across the UK. Weve all tried to do our best but I dont think any of us are in a position to crow or to feel satisfied about this.Its not politics. Every country right now has a real duty to remain focused on doing everything we can to tackle this and not use it as some kind of political weapon.Ms Sturgeon tweeted this morning: One of the key arguments for independence is the ability of Scotland to take our own decisions, rather than having our future decided by politicians we didnt vote for, taking us down a path we havent chosen. His presence highlights that.She then retweeted a cartoon showing Mr Johnson breaking apart the Union, saying the sentiment of her last tweet was neatly illustrated by it. Writing in The Times of Scotland today Mr Johnson said: When I stood on the steps of Downing Street one year ago, I pledged to be a prime minister for every corner of the United Kingdom. Whether you are from East Kilbride or Dumfries, Motherwell or Paisley, I promised to level up across Britain and close the opportunity gap.The past six months have shown exactly why the historic and heartfelt bond that ties the four nations of our country together is so important and the sheer might of our Union has been proven once again.Mr Johnson highlighted all of the money ploughed into Scotland from the Treasury to help businesses and workers stay afloat during coronavirus. He said thanks to those efforts a third of Scottish workers were saved from being laid off. He wrote: There have always been and will always be those who, for their own reasons, devote their time and energy to driving us apart.But the simple truth is that whether it’s a Scottish scientist discovering penicillin in a London lab, an English-born author churning out chapters of Harry Potter in an Edinburgh café, or Westminster and Holyrood working together to secure tens of millions of pounds for the Islands Growth Deal, the people of the UK have always achieved more as four than as one.Support for Scottish Independence is on the rise again, according to analysis of polls done by the Institute for Government. A poll by Panelbase last month had support in favour of independence at a record margin of  per cent to  per cent. The SNP swept up  of Scotland  seats in the election last year which Ms Sturgeon claimed gave her a renewed, refreshed and strengthened mandate” to hold a second referendum on Scotland.Mr Johnson has also talked up the idea of building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland to further cement the union. He said although the Treasurys efforts had saved , Scottish workers, the union was more than just a leboat or a marriage of convenience. He wrote: Being Scottish and British means so much more than someone who lives in this part of the world. He said we are there for each other in sickness and in health. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the PM thought Scotland was too stupid to take care of itself.He told BBC Radio : I think hes going to find that this message is going to go down particularly badly in Scotland.Is he really saying that any other small nation in Europe and any other part of the world doesnt have the capability to deal with the Covid crisis I think the days of telling Scotland that we are either too wee, too poor or too stupid really is over.Throughout the coronavirus crisis, the strategy towards easing lockdown has been fractured as the devolved administration have gone their own way. Ms Sturgeon has been the most openly critical of Mr Johnson, claiming his messaging doesnt make sense and reinforcing the stay at home advice long after he changed it to stay alert.

The law will criminalise any act of subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces.The heaviest penalty that can be imposed is le in jail, the editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper claimed after citing those who have seen the draft of the law.Under the law, damaging public transport can be considered terrorism and those found guilty will be banned from standing for public office.Some trials will not be held in public while iniduals can be wire-tapped and put under surveillancethey are suspected of criminality.Beijing is also set to establish a security office in Hong Kong with its own law enforcement personnel and with the power to send some cases to mainland China to be tried.Beijing will further have power over how the law should be interpreted and Hong Kong will have to establish its own national security commission to enforce the laws, with a Beijing-appointed adviser.The UK ditched an extradition agreement with Hong Kong and has refused to sell arms to the city-state over fears of Chinese influence.The Government claims the change violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration.The declaration was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong freedom from Chinese rule under the one county, two systems model for  years after the handover of the former British colony in .The law prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or as foreign intervention in Hong Kong affairs.Pro-democracy leader Nathan Law fled to the UK after the law came into effect this month. The Government scrapped plans to give Chinese-state owned Huawei access to Britains G network as Boris Johnson vowed to take a tough stance where it disagreed with China. Mr Johnson has warned he was not going to be pushed into a position of being a knee-jerk Sinophobe on every issue to do with China.He added: What we wont do is completely abandon our relationship with China, China is going to be a giant factor in our geopolitics, weve got to have a calibrated response.Were going to be tough on some things but also continue to engageon others.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ordinarily MPsto their constituencies to take a well-deserved break, catch-up on casework and enjoy a summer fete or two. Prime Ministers demonstrate their patriotic credentials by getting snapped holidaying in a UK seaside resort. And junior ministers and shadow ministers get their moment in the proverbial sun while the big beasts are away. This summer’s recess is going to be a time of great unknowns Both the PM and his Labour counterpart will be strategically planning maximum use of the time, whilst bracing themselves for the next stages of the coronavirus crisis. The approach required is the same, but for dferent reasons. And for the PM the next six weeks could spell trouble. Without the daily routines of Westminster and the verbal jousts of the House of Commons there will be a gap in the headlines. The Government’s ability to control the agenda with a daily stream of seemingly positive news will be limited.  Johnson has already stumbled badly in his response to the pandemic, from the deadly mismanagement of care homes to his inability to get all his cabinet ministers to give the same advice in public. The PM will be out and about shoring up public support because he knows he needs to hang onto people who aren’t naturally Tory voters.  He’ll be offering some turbo-charged ‘levelling up’ - but the slogans will be as questionable as they are brazen. And the likelihood is, they’ll be overtaken by Covid-related developments the PM can’t influence. In contrast, Keir Starmer has momentum. The Labour party is back in the ring and Starmer has passed the early tests of his leadership, showing judgement, competence and resolve both in holding the government to account and in starting to change the Labour party. He knows the job has hardly started, but most people’s impressions of the new leader are positive, which is all that can be asked after four months in office. Labour’s task for the summer is to continue making progress.  In  the party lost votes from every type of voter, in almost every corner of the country, something that Starmer doesn’t shy away from. The elections in May are coming into sharp focus and the Party must show real progress, particularly in Scotland. To do so, Starmer has work to do with an audience closer to home – his party, and former Labour voters.We can expect him to be spending a lot of time this summer in Scotland, as well as those ‘red wall’ towns in the north, midlands, and Wales. This is where recess favours him. Rebuilding those ties is best done outside of the parliamentary glare. Both Starmer and Johnson face a big challenge in cutting through to their respective audiences at a time when most of us would rather switch off.

But the cash amount will plunge because GNI has tumbled during the Covid- pandemic. The chair of the Commons International Development Committee slammed the timing of the announcement - which gave MPs no chance to give it any scrutiny. Sarah Champion said it was poor practice and there had been no consultation over the line by line review of aid projects. The Liberal Democrats branded the move callous.International development spokesperson Wendy Chamberlain said: Despite previous assurances that clearly werenapost worth the paper they were written on, we now see the callous Tories for who they really are. This devastating cut to international aid is a clear sign that the UK is abandoning the world stage. Because of this Government more children will have their le chances blighted by poverty.

So Keir Starmer deserves credit for carrying out his pledge to eradicate the stain of anti-Semitism from Labour. The Labour leader had already shown he was genuine in this commitment by dismissing Rebecca Long-Bailey from the Shadow Cabinet. Today he took another major step towards restoring Labour’s reputation by apologising to staffers who had blown the whistle on Jeremy Corbyn’s failure to deal with anti-Semitism. As Mr Starmer told Boris Johnson at Prime Minister’s questions, the party is now under new management. The Labour leader’s resolute leadership puts Mr Johnson to shame.When asked a series of serious and important questions yesterday about Russian interference and the Chinese persecution of Muslims the Prime Minister responded with pathetic jibes and ill-judged jokes. Only one of these two party leaders has the gravitas and decency needed for these times – and it is not Mr Johnson. Lack of clarity From the off the Government’s policy on masks has been mired in confusion. At first we were told there was no need to wear one only for ministers to change their tune long after other countries used them. They finally ordered face coverings on public transport and from tomorrow they will be obligatory in shops and supermarkets in England.

In April less than % of the countryaposs coronavirus linked deaths occurred at East Kent Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust. That figure has more than doubled month-on-month since, reaching % of the countryaposs total  deaths by July . Meanwhile, Kentaposs three other hospital trusts have not recorded a single coronavirus death in the last fortnight. However, East Kent accounts for .% of all coronavirus deaths in England during the pandemic so far - only slightly more than its number of patients would predict.Its recent spike seems to have been relatively short lived and is now on the decline.The Trust - which has hospitals in Dover, Canterbury, Ashford, Margate and Folkestone - has recorded  per cent more Covid-related deaths than any other NHS provider over the last month, analysis by HSJ shows. It had  Covid-related in-hospital deaths in the  days to  July, with Pennine Acute Trust reporting  and the George Eliot Hospital Trust in Nuneaton and University Hospitals of Leicester Trust both recording . While East Kentaposs trust is one of the biggest in the country and cares for , people, its rate of infection is wholly out of proportion given it patients only make up .% of the English population. It is thought in-hospital transmission has played a major part in high infection rates across east Kent, with new cases particularly high in Ashford, home to the William Harvey Hospital.  Ashfordaposs infection rate - the number of people catching the virus out of every , - is currently second-highest in the country, at ,. It is second only to Leicester, which is the only other authority to have a rate higher than . Leicester has been subjected to a local lockdown because of the high number of new cases in the city. A spike of new cases at the end of May occurred largely in Ashford and Thanet, which host the regionaposs two acute hospitals. Meanwhile, East Kent Hospitals Trust has confirmed it is receiving help from NHS England and NHS Improvement to control the spread of infection. A spokesman for East Kent Hospitals said: “Our staff are dedicated to caring for all our patients and have been touched by each death during the pandemic. “We are working with Public Health England and other partners to fully understand the recent number of deaths, but we know that the initial increase in patients presenting for treatment in East Kent Hospitals began later than in England as a whole, the population of east Kent is signicantly older with more comorbidities than the England average and we are one of the largest trusts in the country. “Infection prevention and control has been our priority throughout this pandemic and has been strengthened by testing all , members of staff.”  Canterbury and Whitstable MP Rosie Duffield branded the number of recent deaths at the trust a cause for concern. Weaposve sought assurances from the trust that the measures being taken to limit the risk of cross infection are serious and robust I will continue to liaise with them and scrutinise the measures being taken, she said. The trust says it is taking steps to control infection, by limiting the number of people on-site, checking temperatures and providing face masks and hand cleansing facilities.

And one account is proudly showing off their home and the work they put in to making it what it is today.A couple, known as Lizzy and Phil, have gone viral on Instagram for sharing their incredible home transformation, reports Birmingham Live.Posting on @RenovationHQ, the pair gave followers a look at how they turned their run-down property in Hertfordshire into a luxurious home for themselves on an IKEA budget.But it hasnapost been a quick transformation, the couple have been renovating their house for the last five years - spending around £, on the changes. After getting married, Lizzy and Phil moved into their new home in . Once theyaposd drawn up plans for their dream home, they started working on the place, making improvements around their full-time jobs in marketing and finance, doing work in the evenings and over weekends.Speaking to LadBible, they said: We have done roughly  percent of the work ourselves, from digging the foundations, plumbing the entire house, converting the garage into four rooms , fitting kitchen, bathrooms, underfloor heating throughout the ground floor and installing the pool, amongst other things.During lockdown we tiled sqm of the back garden. It was back-breaking but a great achievement over the period.  Lizzy added: The house has full home automation, which includes scene lighting, whole house audio, room-by-room smart heating and an integrated audio-visual system.While their house now looks amazing, it did cause quite a bit of stress - the pair spent six months without heating during the winter months after the gas had been switched off and spent a year without a proper back on the house. Brrr!They also struggled with everything they owned being constantly covered in dust and having to make sacrices to afford the rennovation. However it all seems to have been worth it now that their beautul home boasts a two-storey extension, a swimming pool and the facade has had a modern makeover, with the brick home being painted white.

As restrictions ease, the Very Big Family Le Survey gives a glimpse of how le has changed over the past few months and how families view the “new normal”. The good news is that two thirds of parents of teenagers say all that time spent together at home has had a positive effect on their family. And the same applies to almost three quarters of those with kids under . Many families have created perfect memories by doing new activities together, such as playing board games, baking, walking and cycling.  Watching TV and streaming services have also provided family bonding time. Very asked parents to reflect on the past few months as they prepare for their children toto school full time. While for some it was stressful, juggling work, home schooling and quality time with the family, others found it fun and inspiring. Writer Gemma Cheetham lives with husband Mike and their two children, Ava-Violet, six, and Gabriel, one . She says the lockdown has made it feel like things have slowed down. She explained: For the first few weeks of lockdown I was working from home, and it was a struggle as Gabriel wanted to be with me all the time.  I’d end up logging on to work early in the morning, stopping at pm and starting again in the evening to make up lost hours. Normally, Mike would have taken the kids out, but when the restrictions came in he couldn’t do that. Then I got furloughed, and at first I enjoyed home schooling Ava-Violet and doing practical things like planting in the garden and baking banana bread.  But I started to notice a real dference in her. She just wanted to stay in the house. Even though we reassured her, she’d say things like, ‘I don’t want to go back to school, I want to stay safe and I want my family to stay safe.’ When her village school reopened, and she was in a small class bubble, she went back to her old self straightaway. She was glad to have the routine again, but she still likes having me at home. I feel like le has slowed down and we’ve been able to just appreciate each other’s company more. Another family feeling the benefit of spending more time together are the Blankstones. Mum Lisa and dad Mark live with daughter Olivia,  .  Estate agent Lisa told us: Olivia was due to sit her GCSEs and obviously she was upset when they were cancelled but since then she’s enjoyed being able to just chill out. I was furloughed, and Mark has his own optician’s which closed temporarily, so we were all at home. Olivia had schoolwork at first, but that eased off so we had lots of free time. We walked every day, exercised at home doing Joe Wicks and David Lloyd sessions. Olivia kept in touch with friends via video chats, and although she said a few times she wished she could see them properly, she was fine. She was disappointed to have our holiday cancelled, but she’s going to college and she’ll be more than ready to have some normality back again by September. We all get on well, so the biggest challenge for us was not being able to see other members of the family.

Lizzy Willis, , was struggling to sleep when she ed home from her sht on the intensive care unit at St Maryaposs Hospital in Paddington, London. She applied to the beauty contest on the off chance of being accepted - but has now got through to next weekaposs virtual semi-final. Lizzy was inspired to apply to Miss England by Dr Bhasha Mukherjee, who took a career break as a junior doctor to win last yearaposs competition. The dedicated nurse, from Maida Vale, West London, said: It was really really random.Follow all coronavirus updates here on our live blogI couldnapost sleep after a night sht one day and I was reading some news articles and I came across the previous winner, Bhasha Mukherjee, and saw sheaposs a doctor I just thought aposoh I could do thatapos I had a look at the website and just decided to send in an application and managed to make it to the semis.Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the contestants will not meet each other or the judges in person.They will be connected via the video calling app Zoom and submit their entries remotely. Lizzy, who is also a British Army reservist, added: The remote nature of it has definitely made it very weird.  We had a trial run the other day and it was quite interesting seeing everyone up on the screen. I guess when youaposre in person you kind of have a lot more freedom with your body language and how you present yourself and what you wear and things. When youaposre just sitting in front of a screen, I have only got a phone screen to record on. Youaposve just got that tiny window to present yourself and sell yourself, so it is tough. Lizzy started her nursing career just before the coronavirus outbreak last December and has been working round the clock ever since.  She said: It has been the busiest and craziest time of my le, definitely in my career. I only just started when this first kicked off. Iaposve been talking a lot with my family about whataposs going on because theyaposre also in the medical profession, so I know they can really relate to how busy and how crazy it is. We are working in conditions and pressures, unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. I had been a qualied nurse for four months before it all kicked off and suddenly I was expected to be more senior and teach the staff drafted in to help.  It was very surreal, nurses and doctors walking round in full PPE with patients either on a ventilator or needing constant monitoring to seethey were deteriorating. While not caring for the sick, Lizzy said sheaposs been focusing on the competition, adding: There are so many elements that there are to do. For example, thereaposs a Miss Eco round. Part of that is making your own outfit and presenting it to the judges. Iaposve been spending quite a few evenings sewing little garments and itaposs been really therapeutic after work.  It is made from old clothing and the idea is to reuse to make something brand new. The competition is something new for me but itaposs also a new way of working. Itaposs a new experience for the judges, let alone the contestants, but everything is very, very positive. You hear rumours that it gets very competitive and the girls are quite mean to each other but this has been very very pleasant.

The house named Oakleigh had been left to rot after it was the scene of a frenzied attack in the master bedroom. Christopher Lumsden kned we Alison around  times in March  after she announced she was leaving him for a family friend. After the savage killing, the five bedroomed residence in Altrincham, Cheshire with its immaculately manicured lawns, tennis courts and coach house remained empty and fell into rack and ruin. Now the house has been restored and renamed and has been put for sale as a striking th century Arts and Crafts villa complete with underground swimming pool, sauna, cinema room and a triple garage.  Details by estate agents Jackson-Stops make no mention of its grim past but promotional material reads: An incredible gothic Victorian villa which has been meticulously remodelled in recent years to form a bright and open house with a subterranean leisure suite.The property was believed to have been built in the s and was once the site of a Catholic boys school in the s. Lumsden, then , a partner at the international law firm Pinsent Masons led a seemingly happy le amid the dinner parties, tennis clubs and bridge evenings he held with fellow members of the Cheshire set.  But his we of  years, a former Sothebyaposs auctioneer, was having an affair with married businessman Roger Flint,  after they met at Bowdon tennis club and in March , she told her husband and asked for a orce. After spending several days putting his affairs in order, Lumsden - who had muscular dystrophy - attacked her when she ed home after spending the evening with her lover. Lumsden, who had been in bed in his pyjamas, told a court how Alison was sat at the dressing table in their bedroom taking off her makeup after telling him she couldnapost live with a cripple. Despite being charged with murder Lumsden was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility claiming he had a depressive illness.  He served two and half years in jail, is believed to have inherited £m from Alisonaposs will and sold the house to a firm of property developers for £.m in November . He later moved to Derbyshire to work as a business consultant. During the project, planning permission on the site was granted to develop and extend Oakleigh. Builders demolished Oakleighaposs orangery and extended the basement area to form an indoor heated swimming pool. One former neighbour said: A woman died horribly inside that house and for a long time it did seem the scars of what happened would not go away.

But there are serious calls to ban the importation and sale of foie gras in the UK. And today comedian Alan Carr is the latest in a line of celebrities and politicians demanding the delicacy is banned from being imported into the UK. Alan says the production of foie gras, which involves force feeding ducks and geese via a metal tube down their throats, “is simply too much to stomach”. He has has joined leading animal protection charity Animal Equality in urging the British Government to ban the importation of foie gras. “Foie gras is no laughing matter and the suffering of these animals is simply too much to stomach,” he says. “That’s why I’m proud to support Animal Equality’s campaign calling for a ban of foie gras imports.” A g jar of foie gras with truffle costs £ at Fortnum and Mason. Other stars who want a ban include Ricky Gervais, Dev Patel, Joanna Lumley, Peter Egan and Thandie Newton. Prince Charles reportedly banned the delicacy from being served in royal house holds in  over the cruel practice. The charity has visited a number of foie gras production facilities over recent years, including a trip to ‘La Ferme Turnac’ farm in France in . Their extensive footage exposes harrowing scenes of severe animal suffering. Terried ducks and geese are seen desperately struggling during ‘gavage’, a brutal force-feeding process where birds are fattened up using a metal tube that is forced down their throats. The animals’ livers swell to up to ten times their natural size and the diseased liver is then sold and marketed as foie gras.  The force-feeding of animals is currently illegal on animal welfare grounds in the UK. Despite this, imports of products involving force-feeding are permitted. In a letter shared exclusively with The Mirror, Zac Goldsmith, Minister of State for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, addresses Green MP Caroline Lucas on this issue, giving hope that the government could bring in a ban soon.Goldsmith concedes: “The production of foie gras from ducks or geese using force feedingraises serious animal welfare concerns” and it is “incompatible with our domestic legislation.”  He added that the Government recognises “the strength of feeling on this issue” and is willing to “consider whether the UK can adopt a dferent approach to foie gras imports and sales in the UK.” Despite these promising sentiments, the Government is yet to draft legislation to enact a ban. Animal Equality’s campaign, running since , has racked up over , signatures of support and has seen a number of successes.  In response to their campaigning efforts, several foie gras sellers have removed the ‘speciality dish’ from their menus, including Tate Modern, Bluebird Cha and Crowne Plaza hotels. YouGov polls commissioned by the charity in  and  also revealed that % of respondents who expressed an opinion were in favour of this ask. The issue has cross-party support too, with Labour, Conservative, Green and Liberal Democrat MPs adding their voices to the cause.  Abigail Penny, Executive Director of Animal Equality UK, said: “Foie gras made by force-feeding is truly sickening. These complex, sensitive animals have no escape and their short lives are full of terror. Alan is using his voice and his  to speak up for these defenceless ducks and geese we couldn’t be more grateful for his backing and the overwhelming support that we’re seeing from the public too.“With the Brexit transition period coming to an end on st December , the UK has a short and ideal window of time to put in place measures to enact a ban – all we need is for George Eustice and Lord Goldsmith to commit. Time is running out and these animals need action now.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper home delivery offer","story":"NewsGet The Mirror delivered free to your door for six weeksIts packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByAlison PhillipsDaily Mirror Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Quickly you find yourself convinced that your house is going to be burnt to the ground by the time youand youaposre kicking yourself for not triple checking all the plug sockets and appliances. You could message your housemate or partner to checkyou have been forgetful, or you might be tempted to turn around and head home for some peace of mind. But it seems thereaposs a much easier way to calm your worries without ruining your plans. Le hack experts over at lehacker have suggested a simple solution to stop you worrying about leaving things on.If youaposre someone who knows this feeling only too well, they recommend taking a photo of your appliances before you go out.In a post on their website, writer Nicole Dieker explained: Before leaving the house, take a photo of your stove and oven dials—or your thermostat, or your iron, or anything  you worry about accidentally leaving on. If your brain starts to play the aposDid I  really  turn it offapos game, you can simply tap your photo app and see for yourself.She went on to explain that this is something she does herself and says itaposs really made a dference.  I started taking pre-vacation photos after my landlord upgraded the heating system in my apartment building and gave us all new thermostats, she said. This was in winter, right before I left on my holiday travels, and since the thermostats were so new that I hadn’t yet become accustomed to them I spent the whole first day of the trip worrying that I had forgotten to turn the thermostat down. She added that she now takes photos showing her oven dials are all in the right place and her thermostat is off before she goes on a long trip - but claims she never actually looks at the photos. Nicole believes this is because taking the photo and having the physical proof, turns off the part of her brain that later gets anxious about leaving something on. And sheaposs not the only one who recommends doing this.

There were hopes in Britain that a Covid- vaccine being developed by researchers at the University of Oxford could be ready by Christmas as the disease continues to ravage countries such as the US, Mexico and Russia. Mike Ryan, head of WHOaposs emergencies programme, said researchers are making good progress in developing vaccines against the virus, and a handful are in late-stage trials. But their first use cannot be expected until early , the expert said as daily new cases around the globe are at near-record levels. It came as the UK government said on Thursday it will provide £ million of funding for a facility to scale up the manufacturing of vaccines for Covid-. Mr Ryan said WHO is working to ensure fair vaccine distribution, but in the meantime it is key to suppress the virusaposs spread. Weaposre making good progress, he said, noting that several vaccines were now in phase  trials and none had failed, so far, in terms of safety or ability to generate an immune response. Speaking at a public event shown live on social media, he added: Realistically it is going to be the first part of next year before we start seeing people getting vaccinated. WHO was working to expand access to potential vaccines and to help scale-up production capacity. Mr Ryan explained: And we need to be fair about this, because this is a global good. Vaccines for this pandemic are not for the wealthy, they are not for the poor, they are for everybody.  The University of Oxfordaposs possible Covid- vaccine - called AZD - could be rolled out by the end of the year but there is no certainty that will happen, the lead developer of the vaccine said on Tuesday. The experimental vaccine, which has been licensed to AstraZeneca produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials, data showed on Monday, preserving hopes it could be in use by the end of the year. The UK government has already ordered  million doses.  The end of the year target for getting vaccine rollout, itaposs a possibility but thereaposs absolutely no certainty about that because we need three things to happen, Sarah Gilbert told BBC Radio  Today, saying it needed to be shown to work in late stage trials, there needed to be large quantities manufactured and regulators had to agree quickly to licence it for emergency use. She added: All of these three things have to happen and come together before we can start seeing large numbers of people vaccinated. On Tuesday, MPs questioned Health Secretary Matt Hancock about the prospect of a vaccine in the UK. He told them that the rate-limiting factor on delivery of a vaccine is its manufacture.  Mr Hancock told Science and Technology Committee he could not promise to play Santa on a vaccine being available by Christmas. During the evidence session, Conservative MP Katherine Fletcher referred to Professor Sarah Gilbert, who is leading the team developing the vaccine at the University of Oxford, and asked Mr Hancock: Are we going to have a vaccine for Christmas  He replied: Well Iaposm an optimist in le Katherine, and on the best case scenario, the answer is yes. And my job is not to second guess whether we will or not, and vaccines are an uncertain science and we need to be cautious, and we need to be careful.

The unnamed Israeli medic had been working at Sheba Medical Center in the city of Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, when she is said to have tested positive in April, before recovering.She was then swabbed twice in May and June, testing negative, before seemingly contracting the disease again after treating a positive patient this month, reports The Times of Israel.There is much debate surrounding the possibility of someone catching the bug more than once, with some experts hypothesising parts of the virus simply remain in the body after a patient appears to have recovered. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  As yet, there is no scientic proof of anyone re-contracting Covid-. However, there is some level of agreement among scientists that those who have had the bug will develop some level of immunity to it, at least on a short-term scale. Professor Gabriel Izbicki, from Jerusalemaposs Shaare Zedek Medical Center, told the Times of Israel: More than half the patients, weeks after testing negative, are still symptomatic.A scientic paper published in the US and entitled aposA case report of possible novel coronavirus  describes an -year-old man who was hospitalised with the virus twice. Despite being put on a ventilator during a long stay at Massachusetts General Hospital before testing negative multiple times, the unnamed man ed again two weeks later and was again admitted to ICU with the virus. His doctors suggest he never actually recovered fully and tests likely werenapost sensitive enough, though other medics debated in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine whether it was possible he contracted the disease twice.

Yousuf had already promised his daughter to a dferent relative a few weeks before, reports Gulf News. As a result, the uncle hid in Sadiaaposs empty family home on Friday before dousing her in petrol and igniting her when she ed home. He then left her alone with her injuries, police said. However, she managed to get outside and attract someoneaposs attention who took her to hospital, but was later pronounced dead. The family, including her parents, had allegedly tried to hide what had happened,burying the body and claiming she was killed in a cylinder blast, according to reports. But police noticed inconsistencies in her parentsapos accounts and eventually arrested the uncle and he confessed to the crime after an interrogation. It appears to be a case of an honour killing, in which someone is killed by their own relatives who believe they have brought shame upon the family. They are still common in parts of South Asia and the Middle East, where women make up the overwhelming majority of victims.

The season before last I had my hip surgery and missed the whole year, but last season I was fully fit for the whole season.“I got a run of games which was good and the next thing is I just need to maintain that myself and stay ready for whatever challenge is next.”Though he’s open to joining another side on these shores, the challenge for the Scottish Cup winner could be his first senior club in his home country.“I will not rule out anything north of the border. I would love an opportunity in England, of course, I have always said that,” he said.“When I first went up there at the start I was always of the mindset that I would like to have an opportunity in England just to see how I would go and what I could do.”Meekings’ decision to leave Dundee centred on his young family and, despite some online criticism surrounding his departure, he thanked the club’s fans for messages of support.#Unfortunately it is part of social media nowadays. I#ve always said it gives people a license to write what they want behind a screen,# he said of negative comments.#A lot of the fans have been positive and have been thankful and thoughtful with their comments afterwards as they understand the time that we are in.

But with the club having to make cuts – they have let go of Jimmy Nicholl the assistant manager, Cammy McDermid the sports scientist – there is cuts being made and I can completely understand that.#The football club needs to survive and Dundee put themselves first in looking after themselves which is completely respectful in the same way as I need to put my family first when it comes to making the decision about my le and our lives.#I think that anyone who thinks about it properly will understand and respect the decision I#ve made.

So,he’s only bringing in two or three new players, they have to work. Fair enough, take time to get it right but he needs to add some quality to the squad.Whether or not that happens, there are a number of players in the squad who will need to step up and play their part in the new season.As I said before, there are question marks across the squad but I also feel players like Jamie Robson and Liam Smith are types who could flourish in the top flight and excel.I’m looking forward to seeing how Louis Appere does with the step up in quality, too.You’ve also got players like Mark Reynolds and Nicky Clark who obviously have quality but are maybe the wrong side of .You need to find the right balance and, looking at the squad, it just feels a bit off right now.There have been a few niggles in pre-season to key players – keeping them fit will be massive because clearly to be successful, United will need Lawrence Shankland, Calum Butcher and Benjamin Siegrist to be fit and firing, no doubt.There is a lot to be positive about the squad at Tannadice after last season but I can’t help but think they will struggle in the top flight without some help.It was a surprise to see Andrew Nelson leave Dundee on Friday.I don’t know the story behind his departure but he’s the type of player I think needs the stability of being at one club for a few years.And I would have liked to have seen that happen for him at Dens Park.Because it is a gamble for a player his age to go looking for a new club.Nelson would no doubt have plenty of chances in James McPake’s first team next season.With finances at the club the way they are, bringing in lots of new players is unlikely.I’d expect the squad next campaign to be a tight one and that spells opportunity for a player like Nelson.The way he started out at Dundee with some big goals in the Premiership, there was a chance to be a success at the Dark Blues.It’s a shame the way it’s all ended for him and the club with the overall situation right now but I guess he feels like it was time to move on.A chance missed for both.The arbritration looking at Hearts and Partick Thistle’s relegation has begun and obviously may have an impact on Dundee United.All this should have been done and dusted, though – the new season kicks off in  days!It’s sad that it has come to this and clubs need to be defending themselves against other clubs.If there was proper leadership from the SPFL and they took control of things from the start we wouldn’t need this.After watching the FA Cup semi-finals at the weekend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a big decision to make at Man U.Following another big blunder, can he afford to stick with David De Gea or drop him tomorrow LEE WILKIE: Micky Mellon less of a gamble for Dundee United than Steve McClaren\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Micky Mellon less of a gamble for Dundee United than Steve McClaren# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-micky-mellon-less-of-a-gamble-for-dundee-united-than-steve-mcclaren embed # secretWnjibuTys\" data-secret\"WnjibuTys\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It#s crazy the response we#ve had since it was announced we could reopen.#Meanwhile, Gina Clarke from Unique Holistic and Beauty Therapies on Emmock Woods Crescent was able to welcome back her first customers yesterday.She has brought in new hygiene measures, such as washing down the bed, chair, door handles and floors between each client, and asking people to fill out an online form before they come for their appointment.She said: “At the start of the lockdown it all stopped and I had to tell anyone who had an appointment booked they couldn’t come.“It was a bit of a worry because we didn’t know what was happening or how they have been doing so I had really been looking forward to reopening.“It feels pretty good to be out of lockdown now and it is great to see customers coming back in and hearing about how they have been doing.“We have some new hygiene standards because it is important to make sure the customers feel safe.“I have to wear a mask and a face visor and I ask all the customers to wear a mask as well.“It is quite weird having to wear that on a daily basis, but we will all get used to it.“This will be the new normal for quite a while.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

There are plenty of places to go and things to do to suit every budget. Here is our guide to the numerous great days out in across our region.WITH BEER gardens entering their second week of opening in Scotland and the five-mile restriction on non-essential travel lted, the country has begun to look forward to a summer of fun.While social distancing measures are still in place and it is important not to take undue risks, there are plenty of things to do safely.Zoos and animal parks around Scotland re-opened on June , and now that the five-mile restriction has eased they canwelcome visitors from near and far. Edinburgh Zoo, Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian, Blair Drummond Safari Park in Stirling and the Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park have all reopened, with customers asked to book in advance. Fe Zoo suffered a devastating fire just days after reopening after the Covid- lockdown, but no animals were harmed and owners have said they hope toto normality as soon as possible thanks to support and fundraising from the local community.Stately homes and gardens have also reopened, with several National Trust for Scotland properties now open to visitors.These include Culzean Castle and Country Park in Ayrshire, Threave Garden in Dumfries and Galloway, Brodie Castle’s garden and grounds, Arduaine Garden in Argyll and Crathes Castle’s garden and estate in Aberdeenshire. Historic Environment Scotland has said that it will monitor the situation and reopen properties in due course.Unstaffed outdoor sites are already open, so visitors can enjoy walks around Edinburgh’s Holyrood Park and West Lothian’s Linlithgow Peel among others.Edinburgh’s historic Royal Mile.Walkers and climbers are now welcome to visit the country’s national parks to enjoy some outdoor exercise. Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen. Glasgow’s The Cranside Kitchen, near the Rotunda, has claimed to be the country’s largest beer garden, with a free-to-enter area seating more than  guests with social distancing measures in place.The beer garden offers a range of drinks alongside food from five popular Glasgow restaurants, Rioja, Halloumi, Pickled Ginger, Kilmurry  Co and La Rotunda. In Edinburgh the Corn Exchange has billed itself as the largest beer garden in the city, having transformed the car park into a space where people can enjoy drinks as well as play darts, ping-pong, swing ball and watch sport, all while observing the necessary hygiene routines. With hundreds of smaller beer gardens open around the country – including Dundee’s The Kilted Kangaroo and Aberdeen’s Siberia Bar and Hotel – there is no shortage of options for enjoying this summer safely and enjoying good times in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"keep your mojo flowing until 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMusicians are wanted to play in Argyll#s next fabulous festival of original music.The organisers of the fourth MOJO festival at Craignish Village Hall have been forced to postpone until the spring of next year due to coronavirus, but artists and bands with Argyll connections # and of any musical flavour # are in demand to showcase their talent.The event#s founder, Dan Sloan-Grfiths, said: #It#s been a tough year all round as we have all had to work out how to deal with COVID-.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and the outer rim of the p piece is obscured, the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel.

He would arrive for a few months in the summer, then vanish until the following year.He was always mysterious as to where he came from and where he was going. He had an accent that some said was Irish, but it was mixed with a most definite local Scots dialect. He was an old man with an unkempt beard. He always wore a bonnet a certain way, and wild strands of white hair grew from the sides of it. While he still had most of his teeth, there was one visibly missing, which was revealed when he smiled. When people asked him his name he would be reluctant to say. People called him the Porridge Maker.His most treasured possession was his cooking pot. It was large and heavy and he would carry it on his back with the help of straps he had made. He tied the lid tightly and all his other possessions would be stored in the pot. It became a kind of rucksack as he travelled.He would walk for miles, humming to himself, singing and sometimes playing his penny whistle. Then he would choose a place to settle for the night, and unpack his pot, and start cooking. He would make an evening broth from whatever he had managed to acquire during his dayrsquos travel. Then under the canopy of the stars, or under the boughs of a treeit was raining, he would wrap himself up in the thick blanket that he used during the day as a kind of jacket.Every morning he would make porridge, and always a larger amount than he would need himself. This was the time when people would enquire as to his purpose and origins. Often it was the small children of the village whose curiosity would make them assemble round him and ask questions. Sometimes they would be shooed away by their parents, but often the older members of the community who had more time would engage him in conversation, and then sit with him.The Porridge Maker had tales and riddles, news from far-flung lands and memories of past deeds and events which made his company fascinating for old and young alike. Soon it became apparent why he would make more porridge than he needed: it was to share. He would share it from his one bowl, which he called his Porridge Quaich. It would be passed round in an almost religious ceremony.But to have a taste of his delicious porridge, a price had to be paid. A story or riddle must be told, a memory shared or some wisdom imparted. The Porridge Maker would listen carefully to everything said. This was one way he gained his vast knowledge of the world and of its stories.The other was, of course, in his travels. As he walked he would observe everything: the way the clouds formed, the song of the birds, the landscape and its curiosities, the way people behaved everything. Then he would just be, and allow his thoughts and observations to mingle. This was how new tales and riddles formed in his imagination.And so as he cooked his evening meal, he would tell stories to himself and whisper his riddles, and he would look forward to sharing them with whoever might come his way and sit by his fire.Then one day, someone recognised him.The Porridge Maker had settled himself away from the road by the River Tyne, downstream from Haddington. He had made a small fire and was cooking a trout he had secretly caught when an old man of similar age walked by, stopped, stared at him, and then made his way towards him.The Porridge Maker thought he was now in trouble. But the old man wasnrsquot interested in the fish. He studied the Porridge Makerrsquos features carefully, then he nodded with a grin.ldquoAye, sae it is ye! said the man with an accusing tone.ldquoAye, fir sure I am maist certainly me! replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYe cannae bamboozle me, said the stranger with a triumphant mocking laughter, ldquoI thocht I kent ye by the way ye wear yer bonnet and by yer stooped shudder, but noo that Irsquove seen yer face I ken fir sure!ldquoAnd  asked the Porridge Maker, seemingly unfazed by this sudden attempt to unmask his identity.The stranger sat himself down and looked the Porridge Maker in the eye.ldquoI cannae mind yer exact name, he said, ldquobut I ken ye were a Jacobite.ldquoThose days are lang past noo, said the Porridge Maker, still keeping his calm.ldquoAye, they are, thankfully. And they hanged many orsquo the likes orsquo ye.ldquoThat they did, replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYer a MacGregor, said the old man, ldquoI mind that, and ye hud blood oan yer haunds ater Prestonpans.The Porridge Maker said nothing. He just stared into his fire.ldquoYe sliced a manrsquos heid in twa by the wall.Suddenly the Porridge Maker looked up. ldquoHowrsquod ye ken that  he asked, now startled.ldquoBecause I wis there!The Porridge Maker now looked the man in the eye.The old man continued: ldquoYe were goanie dae the same tae me. I hud nae weapon sae I punched ye.ldquoAye, said the Porridge Maker, ldquoI remember that weel enough, revealing the gap in his teeth that was the result.The old man laughed.ldquoThat punch saved ma le, said the old man, ldquofir it gied me time tae run as ye stood like a stunned rabbit. But I saw ye ater, greetin like a bairn.The Porridge Maker was silent but pursed his lips and nodded.ldquoYe cudnae thole it cud ye  said the man accusingly.ldquoI wis a lad, and arsquo fired up with rage, said the Porridge Maker. ldquoHe wisnae the only one that day I killt. But I vowed he wud be the last Irsquod kill tae decorate anotherrsquos pride. He hud cried fir mercy sayin he had bairns, but I didnae understand his words till after Irsquod cut him.The old man laughed. ldquoSae much fir the great warrior race! Ye deserted after the battle, didnrsquot ye  Ye ran awa like a coward and cudnae gang hame. If the Redcoats hadnae caught ye, yer ain family wud huv disowned ye fir the coward that ye are!ldquoI did go hame after, but I found ma hoose burnt and ma we and bairns slain. Sae I hud nae family left after that time, said the Porridge Maker with a breaking voice.The old man bowed his head. ldquoAye, it wis a sair time richt enough. But the wages orsquo rebellion are unforgiving.ldquoDae ye ken the name orsquo the lad that I killt by ye  asked the Porridge Maker hopefully.The man was surprised by the question, and looked at the ground as he thought.ldquoWull I think, aye, it wis Wull. I mind he wis really feart, poor lad, he carsquod fir his mither as he died.The Porridge Maker lowered his head, reliving that moment he had tried so often to forget.Neither men had yet exchanged their names.ldquoYou hungry  asked the Porridge Maker, ldquofor ye can share whit I have ye huv earned it by sharing yer memory wi me.And so two men, who once had tried to kill each other, now shared a meal.ldquoWull, the Porridge Maker whispered as he ate.He finally had a name for the young lad hersquod slain all those years ago in  at Prestonpans.The deepest wounds of war are often those unseen, and the stories left out by military historians are the stories of lives traumatised and changed forever.Sadly, whatrsquos left of the Prestonpans battlefield site is now under threat by proposed new developments."},{"url":null,"title":"column-heyday-open-air-pools","story":"Open-air pool lidos in England are already open.If we were back in our former holiday heyday, we could offer a choice of three seaside lidos.Swimming lsquopondsrsquo at Port Seton, Dunbar and North Berwick once buzzed with summer sociability in the sun.For families, they offered entertainment, like galas, ing displays, water polo matches and midnight bathing.A fortnightrsquos lsquobucket-and-spadersquo seaside holiday drove the popularity of lidos between the wars.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and,the outer rim of the p piece is obscured the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

If you have a shady corner, make sure you plant shade tolerant options, andyou have sun trap areas, select plants that will flourish there.\"Allens top plants for a tropical sensation...Trachycarpus fortunei - a really hardy palm , this will give your garden the exotic look and feel without the need to worry about whether it will survive through winter. They are rather slow growing, ultimately reaching a height of over m after - years.Canna - any type of canna will bring large juicy leaves and exotic looking flowers in pink, orange, yellow, white or red. Some have iegated leaves such as Canna Stuttgart or Phaison.Passlora caerulea - a hardy semi-evergreen climber with the most striking flowers. This vigorous plant will cover a wall or pergola in no time.Fatsia japonica - a medium-sized evergreen shrub with palmately-lobed leaves to cm in width, and small white flowers in clusters and small black fruits.Dahlia - extravagant and flamboyant flowers, plus they flower all summer long. For drama and colour, try Karma Chocwith dark red velvety flowers, or Edwins Sunsetwith beautul vivid red flowers that almost glow.Use decor and accessories...Blend your tropical-looking plants with exotic accessories and seating to create a holiday feel. Experts at Dobbies Garden Centresoffer five design tips to help you into the holiday mood.... Go totally tropicalFill patio containers with a selection of vibrant bedding or perennial cottage garden plants for an instant display of foliage and flower colour, including Cordyline australis Peko, along with potted palms such as Phoenix canariensis, Chamaerops humilisand Trachycarpus fortunei to add height and interest and look great in groups. Position pots behind garden furniture to create the illusion that they are planted in the ground.. Create a colour popBring a brilliant burst of sunshine and add some zing to your exterior space using an eclectic array of brightly coloured pots, mixing and matching flowers in contrasting shades for maximum impact. Fun accessories will quickly brighten patios or balconies. Choose pots in vibrant primary colours, which will really pop against white or neutral backdrops.. Bring the indoors outBrighten your garden getaway by bringing houseplants outside for the day. Adding your favourite indoor orchid to a bistro table will create a tropical centrepiece - just be sure tothem to their normal home later on to ensure they dont get exposed to too much direct sunlight.An outdoor rug will instantly transform your space and offers protection to patios and decking from sun cream spillages or melting ice creams. They also help to zone an area, adding a stylish decorative touch. Day beds and hanging egg chairs are the ultimate garden getaway luxuryyou have room.. Make it magicalFor atmospheric evenings, accessorise with a iety of lanterns, fairy lights and candles to enhance the mood - it is amazing how magical a space can look at twilight. A stylish lantern, or a solar-powered string of lights draped across trees and fences will stretch out the time spent outside. Use blankets, floor cushions and chunky knit throws to keep warm and curl up under the stars.. And when the sun sets...Take the chill out of cooler evenings by investing in a practical chiminea or fire pit for your patio, adding warmth and light to extend outdoor entertaining.And think about how you are going to protect your plants during the cooler months, RHS expert Allen advises. \"As many domestic gardeners do not have the time or space to bring plants inside over winter, it is essential to protect in situ. If focusing on the tropical look, select hardy options such as trachycarpus, fatsia, eucomis, tricyrtis, schefflera and zantedeschia, which will re-emerge after winter.\"If you want to have bananas or half-hardy palms, try wrapping them throughout the winter using horticultural fleece or hessian and fill the inside with straw for extra insulation,\" she adds."},{"url":null,"title":"books-richard-holloway-finding-spirituality-godless-world","story":"Richard Holloway, the former Primus - or leader - of the Scottish Episcopal Church, may, however, have written a book which lays the first few paving stones on the path to finding some sort of spiritual meaning in a world in which God has long ago died.I had my last flash of believing in God when I was about seven. My grandmother was ill and I remember kneeling and praying at the foot of my bed for her. But even then, as a child, I knew what I was doing was ridiculous. I wouldnrsquot have understood the words ldquointerventionary God in , but I knew innately that there was no great being in the sky who was going to answer my prayers and make my grandmother better. Only science could do that.My grandmother lost her own faith after the death of her husband, but shersquod instilled in me a love for both the stories of the Bible and the poetry of it. By  Irsquod read the Bible from cover to cover. Reading it on your own - with no minister or priest to guide, or misguide, you - is perhaps the surest path to atheism. The biblical God is a monster, a Bronze Age psychopath, and the stories of the Bible are patently just that - stories. The Bible contains truth only in the way that a fairytale contains truth: therersquos wisdom and teaching there, not history or fact.The positive lesson I took from it was this:Jesus really existed then he was one of the most remarkable humans to ever live and we should all try to live by his teachings. He was no God, just a great and wise human being.I spent my twenties sneering at and hating religion. By my thirties, as I found myself growing into fatherhood, I realised that while I still had contempt for religion and faith, the lack of meaning in my le - beyond the love of my children and family - was starting to trouble me.By my forties I understood that while atheism is factually, historically, scientically the only game in town, theres something about the human mind that requires more than pure reason alone. Reason does not provide meaning. It merely explains.Reason tells me God doesnrsquot exist. But then what  Shopping, spending, consumption, gyms, acquiring more money, ambition, work, aimless travel, TV as an analgesic for the soul hellip drink, drugs, food, sex, endless bitter and dark cynicism  What replaces God in a world where God is dead  What holds the centre together Irsquove just turned , and, like most of the world amid the pandemic, my thoughts have been tinged with intimations of mortality these last few months. Then along comes this octogenarian from Glasgow called Richard Holloway and he offers a speck of hope.This is no self-help book, incidentally. This isnrsquot New Age hokum, rather the working out of a manrsquos soul,such a thing exists. Itrsquos the story of Hollowayrsquos intellectual le, its trials, its failings, and how he has come to find spiritual meaning free from the dictum of religion.I struggle to define this book - Stories We Tell Ourselves: Making Meaning in a Meaningless Universe - beyond saying that it represents a first step toward a new form of spiritual thought. Holloway, once one of our nationrsquos leading religious figures, is now ldquoa Christian without God. He does not believe in the fairytales of religion - and he especially distrusts the ldquoruthless optimism of priests and ministers, and the cost they have wrought to human happiness - but he holds the Christian message as close to his heart as any man or woman still wearing the cloth of God.ldquoI follow Jesus, he says in closing his book, ldquoetsi deus non daretur. Or to translate the Latin, ldquoasGod were not there. Science has consigned God to the grave, but we can still live the ideals of Christianity without buying into the ludicrous myths of Adam and Eve and Noahrsquos Ark.What Holloway does most powerfully is dismiss certainty in all its forms - political as well as religious. People have died for certainties, and killed for certainties, whether its how a person prays or how much power a political party has. Today, those certainties are seen rightly as ghastly jokes, absurd crimes, like the war Jonathan Swt satirically imagined in Gulliverrsquos Travels which raged between those who opened their boiled egg from the bottom or the top.We can be certain of nothing, Holloway tells us, but doubt and love. Wersquore surrounded by ldquoruthless optimists on all sides politically - leavers, remainers, Yes, No, left, right - on it goes - others demanding we see the world through their eyes only. Holloway says to hell with that. Nobody knows anything when it comes to the decisions which shape the future - wersquore all taking shots in the dark. What matters is that we acknowledge our limitations, take others into consideration when we make our choices and try to hold a sense of love in our hearts for every living creature.Holloway speaks of ldquoresolute irresolution, the necessity of holding two opposing ideas in onersquos head at the same moment - God may be dead but the message of the man called Christ matters. Most of all, he says, we must not ldquoclose our account with reality. In other words, we must never shut our minds, and think we have found the answers because we havenrsquot and never will.This is a gospel of love, and doubt, that everyone can practice - especially atheists. For that Irsquom truly grateful to Holloway for codying what Irsquove innately felt throughout my le. Itrsquos brought a flicker of light into a darkened world. Holloway brings a message of spiritual hope for all - and for that, a few hundred years ago, this very wise and very kind man would have been burned to death at the stake. That makes him a hero in my eyes, and so and I say, God bless him."},{"url":null,"title":"cork-people-proud-show","story":"\"I feel I can do anything in front of the crew, which we have - theres not much of me that the crew hasnt seen!\" quips the Cork-born star, .In the BBC comedy, Murphy plays Conor MacSweeney, whos best friends with Jock OKeeffe, played by fellow Corkonian, Chris Walley, .Over the past two series - spin-offs from the  film of the same name - we have followed the two loveable rogues as they get themselves into all sorts of sticky situations.Particularly memorable storylines include the teenagers attempt to steal a giant tuna fish from the market in series one, and when they got expelled after stripping off in the classroom and peeing on Principal Walshs leg in series two.Now were getting a series three, in which we see the lads trying to make their way as young adults, with yet more questionable methods of making some money, all while Jock navigates being a new dad.One things for sure things wont go smoothly.Here, we chat to Walley and Murphy, plus Hilary Rose - who plays Conors stressed-out but loving mum, Mairead - to find out more.NEW CHAPTERIts an unconventional family set-up in The Young Offenders, which is set and filmed in Cork.A heart-warming episode in series one saw widower Maireadbecome a foster mum to Jock - whose mum is also dead - after he escapes his abusive, alcoholic dad.At the end of series two, Jocks girlfriend Siobhan - whose dad happens to be Principal Walsh, who is far from the biggest fan of Jock and Conor - gave birth to baby Star .The new addition to the family means Principal Walsh and his we Orla - whose other daughter Linda is going out with Conor - now have to engage more with Mairead, which hasnt always gone well in the past.\"Season three was interesting from a character point of view because Mairead really cuts loose and, at some stages, the lads are telling her to calm down!\" follows Rose, whos also from Cork, and married Peter Foott - who created The Young Offenders - since .As for the love story between her and Sergeant Healy, she teases \"season three kinda continues that on-again, off-again, will they, wont they vibe\".The main storyline for series two is how Jock is adjusting to everyday le with baby Star.\"Conor and Jock are still getting into their sticky situations but now theres just a baby there as well,\" reveals Walley.\"I think its just a major sht in their lives and theyre just trying to figure it out all together.\"PARENTING LESSONSTwins Nola and Penny Richardson shared the role of Star, and Walley says the babies were \"incredible\".\"I want one!\" exclaims Murphy, before quickly adding \"not right now\".Rose chimes in at this point, saying she has told the boys they are always welcome to babysit her kids .\"Theyre both amazing babysitters, but there was a time when Jake was very young where they bought him a nerf gun,\" she recalls, which sets them all off laughing, with her on-screen sons looking a little sheepish.\"I dunno, we were buying toys and we were like, This is what kids that age like!\" reasons Walley.\"There was some force off ityou shot it,\" he concedes. \"Theyre heavy-duty.\"\"That was a real Conor and Jock moment for the two of us,\" admits Murphy.Having Penny and Nola on set this series was definitely a learning curve for the young actors.\"I was terried of holding babies for fear I dropped them,\" confides Walley. \"By the end of the shoot, I just was inseparable.\"MEMORABLE MOMENTSAccording to Murphy, \"theres not a street in Cork city that we havent filmed on\".\"The Cork people are so proud of the show.\"Having crowds watching them film was something they \"had to get used to pretty quick.\"\"There was a great photo in the paper a few years ago, of us making the film there are about  people in the crew, no-ones watching us filming,\" notes Murphy.\"And then there was a photo of us making season , and there were just crowds of people watching.\"It was good, it was like doing a play every day, whenever we were filming outside in the city.\"One of the new episodes sees Jock, Conor and Mairead take a trip to Dublin.Whilst filming on a road in the Irish capital city, they reveal they were pulled over by Leo Varadkars entourage as he was driving past them in an unmarked executive car.The Irish politician was taoiseach at the time .\"There was a camera in the back seat, and we were mid-scene and we were like, What does this guy want  Were filming!\" says Rose.\"And eventually Alex put down the passenger window and was like Hey!, and next thing Leo Varadkar leaned forward!\"\"His driver was like, Great show!\" recalls Murphy. \"We were like, Do you like it [to Varadkar] And he went, I havent seen it!\"\"But he did say, Ive heard its great\", adds Rose.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTThe biggest thing Rose has taken away from making The Young Offenders is the amazing relationships theyve formed with cast and crew .\"Its about getting the job done and doing the best that you can, but you have to remember as well, for actors, were really vulnerable in front of all the crew, so you kinda put your trust in them,\" she elaborates.\"If were doing emotional scenes, theyre witnessing it, theyre trying to support you.\"As for future series, Murphy points out the only issue could be that he and Walley dont exactly look  anymore.\"At some points in the script, Jock will go, We cant do that, were only , and we were like, Can we just not mention our age \" he continues, chuckling.\"As long as we look young, I guess well see what happens.

They are much more worth the investment. Its not worth planting bedding plants at this time of year,\" says the BBC Gardeners World regular.You can enjoy a riot of colour with late-summer flowering perennials in shades ranging from zingy yellows to scorching reds and burnt oranges, which will last into October.\"Theres a huge group of plants which are all from the States, but which we think of as common English cottage garden plants, flowering from mid-summer onwards,\" adds Klein.Here are some of her recommendations...ASTERS\"Michaelmas daisies start flowering as we go into August but then they will go right the way through,\" she says. \"Aster novi-belgii is a tough aster which never seems to get disease and is ideal.\"They can be planted in summer, where you have gaps left by early-flowering plants, and grow to around cm. They prefer sun or light shade and should be kept well watered in dry soils. They make good companions with other autumn-flowering plants, including Japanese anemones.HELENIUMS\"These plants, which are vaguely from the daisy family, are superb. If you keep on deadheading, they will flower right up to the end of September,\" says Klein. \"They are just starting to flower. My favourite is Helenium El Dorado, which produces great big golden flowers, and Sahins Early Flowerer. There are lots of traditional ones, including Moerheim Beauty with its dark, copper-red daisy-like flowers, which are also popular.\"When you deadhead, cut down to the next bud on the stem, which will then flower and you can get a show through to autumn. Lt and ide heleniums every few years, which will increase your stock, Klein adds.\"If you split them in the spring, they almost fall apart for you. We do that with ours, planting three little pieces at a time.\"RUDBECKIASRudbeckias, also known as coneflowers because their bright yellow petals hang down, emphasising the prominent dark central cone, are from the same group of North American daisies. \"Rudbeckia fulgida deemii or Goldsturm are both beautul,\" Klein enthuses.Goldsturm has such an abundance of flowers that it has an almost solid effect in the late summer border. Use the smaller ieties with fiery displays of crocosmias and red hot pokers in a border, or put them in a pot to add patio colour, around perhaps a burgundy cordyline. Taller types can be put at the back of a border, framed by late-flowering clematis.PERENNIAL SUNFLOWERThese helianthus are not like the traditional big-flowered annual we know and love, but they do make a statement and come back year after year, says Klein.\"My favourite is Lemon Queen. Its a big plant but even in a little garden, you can have a big plant for impact, that will flower into October and occasionally even further.\"It grows to around m tall, with coarse, deep green foliage and light yellow flowers cm wide, with pale yellow ray florets and a dark yellow central disk.CROCOSMIASAlso known as montbretia, crocosmias are one of the main features at the RHS Tatton show. They may have a reputation for being a bit invasive, but you can just pull up the cormsthey outgrow their space, she says.\"Id put crocosmias with any of the plants weve just mentioned. I have Crocosmia Lucer, which has just started to flower and it is taking over from big euphorbias.\"MISCANTHUSDont just consider colour when youre filling the gaps, because grasses come into their own in summer and beyond. \"Varieties like Miscanthus Flamingo are so useful because they look good now but they will have beautul plumes in September, and then you can leave them all winter for structure,\" says Klein.Many of these plants can be obtained from the nurseries who attend the RHS shows, including Bluebell Cottage Gardens , Morton Nursery , Daisy Roots , Hardys Cottage Garden Plantsand Burncoose Nurseries .For more late summer gardening inspiration, visit rhs.org.uk tattonathome"},{"url":null,"title":"recipe-mary-continis-cream-chicken-soup","story":"Come rain or shine, the beaches were packed from morning till night and our cafes and chip shops did a roaring trade.

Each was clutching a bowl heaped with jewel-like fruits, and as they passed it was aswersquod glimpsed the three Magi.A few days ago, we were invited into the same garden, to help ourselves to raspberries. It had been a day of torrential rain, with intermittent sun. The sky was darkening as we made our way between the rows, which were heavy with fat sweet rasps. When the rain began, I put up my hood, and picked on. The scent of wet leaves and trodden earth was intoxicating, a bouquet richer than a Barola. These bushes had been growing here long before our friends arrived,  years ago. They are kept company by apple and pear trees, redcurrant bushes, and plums that, when ripe, hang from the branches like ear-rings. Therersquos also a large bed of still-ripening strawberries. One year I watched a mouse, on tiptoe, nibbling a dangling berry.Irsquove rarely tasted better raspberries than the ones we collected, their flavour enhanced by the atmosphere of the garden where they grew.

That book that made such an impression on me as a girl that I drove my parents nuts begging to be allowed to buy a derelict Victorian walled garden close by. I would climb onto the seat by the bus stop to look over its wall and plan how Irsquod clear it of weeds and shattered glass house and fill it with vegetables and flowers. Since Irsquod shown no desire to lt so much as a dandelion in our own back yard, I was told to dream on.The garden where we, and others, are invited to forage is a perfect complement to the fields and hills beyond. Flowerbeds, graceful trees and a croquet-style lawn coexist seamlessly with fruit and, previously, rows of vegetables too. When people picture the rural idyll, itrsquos often a rose-festooned house where hollyhocks run amok. Yet the true cottage garden was never chocolate-box pretty but a place where leeks and cabbages grew among primroses and poppies ndash more Mr McGregor than Vita Sackville-West. That is still the case. In one of my favourite Hoolet gardens, a formal square bed of roses encloses a profusion of succulent young lettuces, ready to lt for lunch.This is an artful nod to where all such cultivation began. Originally, humble countryside plots were essential sources of food there was no room for unproductive and time-consuming grass, or patios where clematis and wisteria rambled towards dormer windows, choking the gutters. Wholly utilitarian, they contained rectangular beds devoted to cabbages and potatoes and, weather permitting, caned trellises for fruit. These were beautul in their own way, but it was only when flowers escaped from hedgerows and colonised the margins and spaces between the plots that they gained nostalgic postcard charm.The plant collector, Major Lawrence Johnston, is responsible for redefining the cottage garden. In the early th century, when he and his mother moved into Hidcote Manor in the Cotswolds, he took the idea of a rural plot, edited its contents, and scaled it up. The result, with winding paths, artistic focal points, and teeming, colourful borders, had the appearance of being haphazard, random and accidental, when in fact it was rigorously planned. It sounds spectacular. Increasingly, though, Irsquom coming to think that outdoor spaces designed solely to please the eye are lacking in one vital ingredient: the kind you can put on a plate.Thanks in part to the generosity of neighbours, we too are starting to feed ourselves: redcurrants and blackcurrants, strawberries ndash still in relative infancy ndash rhubarb, carrots and herbs. Wersquore not in the league of those who can nurture asparagus Irsquom told it takes seven years for a first crop to appear. In fact, wersquore not in any league at all. After Alan dug up last yearrsquos potatoes, I replanted that bed with roses, honeysuckle and lavender. At one point in late spring, these new arrivals were suddenly swamped by a profusion of shaws, as the undetected, button-sized potatoes left buried in the winter sprouted into le. Following a striking display of flowers, we now have an unexpected crop of delicious spuds to keep us going for weeks. The satisfaction of filling your own larder is immense.

Any judgment on his first year in office is necessarily a verdict on how he dealt with the virus crisis.: Remainers need to move on says PMThough Mr Johnson would prefer to wait for the official inquiry, public opinion is way ahead of him. In a poll last week for the Sun on Sunday,  per cent of respondents thought he was doing well in his job, compared to % for Chancellor Rishi Sunak and % for the newly installed Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.The new Commons double act of Johnson and Starmer was in action again yesterday at the last PMQs before the summer recess. These contests have settled down to a familiar routine in which prime ministerial bluster meets lawyerly formality. Neither man will be truly tested until the Commons, like everything , is back to normal, or the ldquonew normal, whatever and whenever that might be.If there is one word which sums up Mr Johnsonrsquos response to the crisis it is ldquoslow. Slow to impose a lockdown. Slow to build up testing capacity. Slow in making sure there was enough personal protective equipment for the front line staff who needed it desperately. Slow to pick up on the crisis in care homes.Since the PM, like the rest of us, was new to the crisis he was given an enormous amount of leeway. Normal business from opposition parties was suspended. The media were onside. He had been an unlucky premier, dreadfully so, but what was political ill fortune when so many people were losing loved ones  Then he fell ill, eventually ending up in intensive care. The shock, and the get well soon messages, were genuine.Whatever goodwill he built up was soon squandered by his refusal to sack his chief aide, Dominic Cummings, for driving to Durham, and beyond, during lockdown. He failed that test of leadership, just as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon neglected to show the door immediately to her chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, on learning of her double lockdown breach. On his way into Number , Mr Johnson said politicians should never forget that the people are the bosses. Well, the people wanted Mr Cummings gone, yet he remains.As for the rest of Mr Johnsonrsquos first year, it was a mixed bag. The proroguing of Parliament and the subsequent defeat in the Supreme Court would be a stain on any PMrsquos reputation.The General Election that followed was a triumph for the party, with hitherto-Labour seats falling to the Conservatives. How much that was due to votersrsquo impatience over Brexit, and how much to then Labour leader Jeremy Corbynrsquos general uselessness, depends on the observer.: Labour will pay damages to whistleblowersThen we come to Scotland, which stands in the same place it did when Mr Johnson became Prime Minister ndash stuck in the middle between the status quo and independence. Scotland has not appeared to figure much in the PMrsquos calculations this past year, though he has had other things on his mind. That is about to change we are told, hence his visit to Scotland today.Thereafter Scotland is to be love bombed by Downing Street, with ministers encouraged to follow the PM north to talk up the benefits of the Union, particularly in the current crisis.This, Mr Johnson believes, will tackle increasing support for independence in the polls and drive it downwards, just in time for the next Scottish Parliament elections. That is the theory, in any case.The reality may be very dferent. Telling Scotland how much better off it is in the Union by talking up how much money has flowed from Westminster suggests those billions are in the form of grants and do not have to be repaid. In fact, Scottish taxpayers, in common with taxpayers in the rest of the UK, will be the ones eventually paying the bills Mr Johnson is running up. To adapt a phrase from a former Chancellor, we are all in this mess together.Mention of George Osborne brings us to the reason Mr Johnson will get in and out of Scotland today ashis trousers were on fire. When it comes to the Conservatives, Scotlandrsquos memory goes back much further than a year.

This week has given a good example of just how unhinged Scottish politics is about to become. Letrsquos take the Russia Report. At heart, it shows the Tory government is utterly unfit for power. Itrsquos incapable of defending the UK. Not only that but the party is floating on a sea of Russian roubles. Westminster has lain down and let Russian oligarchs use it as a doormat to Britain where they can launder dirty money.Then we come to Brexit. In the reportrsquos wake, we now know the UK Government actively avoided looking at any evidence that Russia interfered in the vote. Thatrsquos not just gob-smacking ndash itrsquos so egregious it would dislocate your entire jaw. What on Earth was the reportrsquos intentionnot to investigate Russian meddling over Europe  It is the \"Russia\" report after all. The giveaway is in the name. What  was it going to investigate  Putinrsquos latest bare-chested poses for the Kremlin Christmas calendar The fish in my fish-tank know Russia had its sticky spooky fingers all over Brexit, particularly when it came to online manipulation and disinformation.The report shows the UK Government to be a cabinet of liars ndash or rather idiots who are bad liars, and think wersquore too stupid to see their lies. Actually, make that lying idiots whorsquod let a hostile foreign power meddle with UK democracy as long as it served its own petty party political ambitions, and helped grters and mountebanks like Boris Johnson get power.Herersquos where the Russia report plays into the growing craziness of Scottish politics, though: the big leak to the press before the publication of the report was that Russia had interfered in the independence referendum. Forget Brexit, put the weight of the report on to Scotland ndash that was clearly Downing Streetrsquos strategy.Evidently, most rational and informed folk accept Russia was trying it on when it came to the  referendum. Why wouldnrsquot it be  But to focus on interference in Scotland and not look into Brexit is nothing but straight up manipulation of intelligence and security.This all shows what way the wind is blowing. With a new Tory unit set up to fight independence, rest assured there will be more stupid dirty tricks. Only a dummy would think otherwise. That means Scottish politics is going to get weird. Downing Street isnrsquot scared to use any cynical ploy.But the craziness isnrsquot all on one side. Far from it. While the independence movement could easily bask in the lunacy of London, saying \"see, this is what we want to save you from\", some elements of the nationalist fringe have decided to don a crazy suit themselves. Support for independence is now the majority position and the SNP is storming the polls as the public responds to coronavirus ndash but why rest on good fortune when you could trash everything Why not hold a rally outside Holyrood, with figures like former SNP MSP George Kerevan, and tell the world that the Yes movement ldquocannot be patient any longer. Why not have speakers say that itrsquos time to ldquostart getting angry  Thatrsquos not going to put off potential Yes voters, surely Why not call for Union Street in Aberdeen to be renamed Independent Street  That doesnrsquot look daft.Why not have an organiser of the nationalist marching group All Under One Banner say that ldquomanaging Covid should run parallel with fighting for independence  Thatrsquos the same marching group where signs denouncing \"Tory scum\" unfurl at rallies. A tactic designed to win over soft unionist voters, Irsquom sure.Why not start talking about Scottish \"freedom\"  Free Scotland from what, actually, is my question  I support independence and itrsquos not because therersquos some colonial army of English occupation in Peebles, itrsquos because I think Scotland can do better on its own than it currently fairs as part of the Westminster system.But it doesnrsquot stop there. Why not start a new political party and use it to drive a wedge between the independence movement  And why not have that new political party, Alliance for Independence, linked to the craziest fringe of the entire Yes movement  A regional AFI organiser was behind the much denounced protest at the border where Yes supporters wore hazmat suits and shouted ldquoplague carriers at visitors crossing from the south.That ought to work. If therersquos anything likely to reach out to a hesitant voter, then this must surely be it. And just for good measure, why not throw Tommy Sheridan into the mix and make sure hersquos involved in this brave new political party too.Done deal. Therersquos no way independence is going to risk any damage from that catalogue of tactical brilliance.The bottom line is this: Boris Johnsonrsquos government is dangerous. It would trash anything and everything for the sake of one objective: raw power. So how is this dangerous government likely to treat Scotland as the independence debate intensies in the coming months  Get ready for a dirty fight, thatrsquos all I can say.Meanwhile in the indy corner, the wild, conspiratorial base is getting out of control, and risks damaging the entire Yes movement with its absurd, juvenile antics. The Yes movement has to get itself in order and keep the extremists in their box. Politics cannot be a matter of \"crazy versus crazy\". The independence movement will only win with reason, openness and persuasion. Anything  is mere posturing, designed to serve the posturer rather than the country or the ideal.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Mr Mundell said: ldquoIt is absolutely shameful that Alex Salmond, the former First Minister of Scotland, remains in the pay of the Kremlin as an apparatchik of Russia Today, and that so few nationalists condemn him for it.Afterwards, the Dumfriesshire MP added: ldquoIt is now abundantly clear that the RT network, controlled by the Russian state, is used to disrupt and destabilise other countries.ldquoAs the Intelligence and Security Committee Report shows, the Russian state is a serious threat to our security and democracy so is it astonishing that Alex Salmond is still taking money

displeasure at Mr Salmonds choice of work, saying in  that \"the choice of channel would not have been my choice\".She added: \"Of course, Alex is not currently an elected politician and is free to do as he wishes, but had I been asked, I would have advised against RT and suggested he seek a dferent channel to air what I am sure will be an entertaining show.\"Neither myself nor the SNP will shy away from criticising Russian policy when we believe it is merited.\"When Ms Sturgeon was asked about the Russia report, Mr Salmond and RT at the Scottish Government daily briefing on Tuesday, she brushed the question aside by saying her views on the subject were already known.Mr Salmond resigned from the SNP in August  after it emerged the Scottish Government had been investigated complaints

Need I mention the case of Julian Assange the founder of Wikileaks, who is being persecuted by the UK simply for telling the truth that the US didnrsquot want published Likewise, itrsquos OK for the UK to stick its nose in the US-inspired attempted regime change in Venezuela by refusing to release gold deposits to its current democratically elected president and to recommence supplying arms to Saudi Arabia which will almost certainly be used against the neighbouring Yemen.

Westminster is rotten and corrupt, politics is rotten and corrupt, the social system is rotten and corrupt, but nothing will ever change.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.IN the absence of theatre, at least we are being offered some farce in the British security services Russia Report.Russia is supposed to have pursued a social media campaign on Brexit and independence, and the first joke is why did it bother  Was it so out of touch  The UK public, having been bombarded for years on a daily basis with anti-EU propaganda, hardly needed any additional tweets. The security services should have been investigating those interfering billionaires, Rupert Murdoch, Jonathan Harmsworth, David and Frederick Barclay. These are the men who wield great power through the Sun, Mail, and the , and their propaganda skills are far superior to a few Russians in a back office.In the Scottish independence referendum, almost all the press was extremely hostile and in no way reflected the distribution of opinion among the public. But this was to some extent counter-balanced by the great peoples movement that grew, often on entirely personal initiatives, on the Yes side. They had only social media and personal contact and in their many thousands used it brilliantly. Any foreign interference on social media,it happened, was entirely superfluous. We did, of course, have some foreign interference ndash by President Obama, by Spanish politicians and some senior EU officials.No-one should ever take what any states security services produce at face value. Always assume that it is as likely to be  as true. They all have agendas. They are all engaged in mind games, it is their job. Remember Iraq, anyone  They are all hacking both friends and enemies. They are all pursuing propaganda initiatives. The US was even caught hacking Angela Merkel. So sit back and watch the show.Isobel Lindsay, Biggar.YES, there should be an investigation into interference into the  referendum. What we know is that David Cameron required UK Embassy staff to cajole foreign governments into opposing Scottish independence in . Russia reported at the time that it was one of them, and we saw the Prime Minister of Spain and the President of the United States make speeches to this effect. Irsquom sure Ian Murray and Murdo Fraser will welcome any such inquiry into this iniquity.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I FOUND that Iain Macwhirterrsquos article UKon the report on Russian interference in the sometimes clouded the main point.He jokingly suggests, in the context of the report, that since he was pro-independence for Scotland in  he might have expected some financial recognition from the Kremlin for his written articles. This acknowledges what most reasonably minded people take from the evidence emerging regarding the revelations about alleged Russian interference.I find it obvious that it is in the political interest of Russia to break apart the UK and hence weaken its strategic integral role in the world. The same argument applies to Brexit, as a Europe without the UK suits Russia. If Russia did in fact make any effective dference in the  result it must therefore have been to swell the Yes vote.What I expect has come out of this foul affair is thatthe old adage ldquoyou should not believe everything you read in the newspapers\" holds true, then it is very many times more true when the message is applied to the internet. The UK has a very long history of distrust and conflict with Russia and our alliance during the Second World War was perhaps something to be seen as an unusual blip in history.However, I find it telling that our UK Government, as some reports admit, \"took its eye off the ball in watching out for both dirty tricks from a foreign power and, I suggest, also did the same for the threat of a killer pandemic.Perhaps it is time the Westminster Government took stock of its elected role and remembered punctually in future when to lt the drawbridge.Bill Brown, Milngavie.IT seems that the Russians have been trying to influence voters in the UK by posting fake messages on social media. I do remember some ridiculous nonsense being circulated in the run-up to the  Scottish referendum. It was said that each voter in Scotland would be worth pound,they voted Yes. The figure had been arrived at by taking the estimated value of oil deposits in the North Sea and iding by the number of voters ndash aseach voter could extract the oil themselves. It was such drivel it must have come from a Russian agent.I hope that any inquiry into the distribution of misinformation at that time will uncover the source and also calculate how many people may have been duped into voting Yes by that phoney get-rich-quick fraud.Les Reid, Edinburgh EH.WITH the much-delayed and redacted report into Russian interference in two referendums finally published, I am reminded of our National Bard, who might have said \"We are bought and sold for Russian gold, such a parcel of rogues in a nation\"Alec Oattes, Ayr.Read more: Sturgeon urged to condemn Salmond for being in the pay of the Kremlin"},{"url":null,"title":"blaze-tears-farmhouse-castlemilk","story":"Large clouds of smoke can be seen in the sky as the blaze tears throughthe property on Revd MacAuley Road, next to Carmunnock Road.Emergencycrews rushed to the scene at around .pm and remain there as theywrestle the fire, which started in a derelict building.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Fire on farm in Castlemilk\",\"description\": \"Fire on farm in Castlemilk\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media qgzZFzzK poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests qgzZFzzK.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": A Scottish Fire and Rescure Service spokeswoman said: \"We received a call at around .pm today for a firein a derelict building.\"We mobilised four applicances to the scene and they remain there.\"There are no reports of any casualties.\"More to follow..."},{"url":null,"title":"schools-re-opening-nicola-sturgeons-top-priority-businesses-set-longer-wait","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has warned traders such as gyms and music venues, that are still unable to restart their operation, that ldquoit is possible that we may not be able to make any changes next week except confirming schools can re-open from August  and a pause in shielding guidance from the end of the month.Education Secretary John Swinney will today update MSPs on the Scottish Governmentrsquos plans to re-open schools ndash but Conservatives have called for ministers to formally commit to a full-timeto education today to give teachers and parents enough time to prepare for classrooms being unlocked.Yesterday, the First Minister stressed that the re-opening of schools is top of her governmentrsquos priorities ndash meaning any further relaxation of rules are unlikely to be confirmed over the coming weeks.:Scots warned they cant book a holiday with certainty amid concerns over Spains Covid spikeAhead of Mr Swinney delivering a statement on his schools proposals, concerns from parents over the plans have been published including fears over childcare and worries over the wellbeing and attainment of children.Ms Sturgeon indicated that the current phase of the Scottish Governmentrsquos four-step plan to ease the lockdown is ldquolikely to last considerably longer than the three-week periods earlier phases were subject to ndash meaning gyms and music venues may not even be told a timescale for when they can re-open at the Scottish Governments next lockdown review.The First Minster has indicated that the ldquoreally signicant changes made over the last few weeks, including allowing pubs, restaurants and shops to re-open, means officials need to ldquocarefully monitor the impact and the number of new cases.She added that the call centre outbreak in Lanarkshire illustrates ldquowhat can happen when people are mixing indoors and when perhaps guidance isnrsquot being rigorously followed.:Scottish schools should employ every qualied teacher in the country ahead of schools re-openingMs Sturgeon said: ldquoOur main focus right now, and I think it is a priority that will have widespread agreement across the country, is on keeping the virus at a low enough level to enable schools to fully and safely re-open from August .ldquoIt is possible that we may not be able to make any changes next week beyond confirming theof schooling and a pause in shielding.The First Minister appealed to businesses waiting to re-open in phase four of her blueprint to be patient.She said: ldquoFor those businesses who are still waiting for a date to restart, I want to thank you for your ongoing patience.ldquoI fully understand how dficult any further delay is for you.

Having such complete and well annotated genomes allowed us unprecedented insight into the genetic and evolutionary abilities seen in bats.Professor Emma Teeling of University College Dublin, co-founding director of BatK, added: ldquoGiven these exquisite bat genomes, we can now better understand how bats tolerate viruses, slow down ageing, and have evolved flight and echolocation.ldquoThese genomes are the tools needed to identy the genetic solutions evolved in bats that ultimately could be harnessed to alleviate human ageing and disease.To generate the bat genomes, the team used new technologies to sequence the batsrsquo DNA and developed new methods to assemble these pieces into the correct order and to identy the genes present.The team compared these bat genomes against  other mammals to locate bats within the mammalian tree of le. They found the strongest support for bats being most closely related to the group Ferreuungulata that consists of carnivores , pangolins, whales and ungulates .The team then systematically searched for gene dferences between bats and other mammals, identying regions of the genome that have evolved dferently in bats and the loss and gain of genes that may drive batsrsquo unique traits.Genome scans revealed changes in hearing genes that may contribute to echolocation, which bats use to hunt and navigate in complete darkness.The team also found evidence that batsrsquo ability to tolerate viruses is reflected in their genomes.The findings mark only the beginning of the teamrsquos work. The remaining -plus living bat species exhibit an incredible ersity in ecology, longevity, sensory perception and immunology, and numerous questions still remain regarding the genomic basis of these spectacular features.BatK aims to answer these questions as more and more bat genomes are sequenced, further uncovering the genetic basis of the animalsrsquo ldquosuperpowers.Senior author Professor Eugene Myers, Director of Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, and the Center for Systems Biology, Dresden, Germany, said: ldquoThese bat genomes provide a superb foundation for experimentation and evolutionary studies of batsrsquo fascinating abilities and physiological properties.In April, it was announced Dr Vernes is to lead a pound.m study at the University of St Andrews on the way bats communicate with each other.It is hoped that by examining their vocalisations and comparing them with other mammals such as seals and dolphins, the study will shed new light on the evolution of human language."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11613848.jpg?type=article-full","title":"world-famous-singer-pops-east-lothian-cafe","story":"Sam visited JoLi, based in The Old Reading Rooms on Longniddryrsquos Main Street.Sam is said to have bought a coffee and some gts, with those at the cafe saying that the Grammy Award-winner stopped off on their travels to North Berwick.Staff at JoLi were ldquoa little bit starstruck when the singer popped by, saying the visit was ldquosomething you do not expect.They described the singer as a ldquolovely guy.A post sharing the news of the visit on social media has attracted a lot of attention from starstruck fans, with one fellow diner saying that she was in having lunch at the time and did not recognise the star.Sam, , is a British singer-songwriter who emerged onto the music scene in .Since then the musician, who delayed the release of their third album, has had several number one and top  hits in both the UK and US, and in  released Writingrsquos on the Wall, the theme song for the James Bond film Spectre.As well as Grammy Awards, Sam has won Brit Awards, Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards, a Golden Globe and an Academy Award.It is believed Sam is on holiday in East Lothian with his family."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotrail-offers-free-travel-unemployed----even-get-job","story":"The coronavirus pandemic has had a huge impact on jobs in Scotland, with figures in May suggesting the number of people claiming unemployment benefit has increased by .% - up about , to ,.The travel firm say that the cost of travelling to an interview can ldquooften be a barrier to ing to work ndash so launched a scheme to fast-track the process.The idea was launched in , but has recently been marketed againby ScotRailas a result of the coronavirus.What can jobseekers get Those eligible can get two freejourneys a month to attend an interview.They can also then get a free ScotRail travel ticket for the first month of theirto work.Jobseekers are also able to take advantage of the Jobcentre Plus Travel Discount Card - a UK Government initiative which allows those who are unemployed and claiming Jobseekerrsquos Allowance or Universal Credit to receive a % discount on selected rail tickets.If youre out of work, were offering two free tickets per month for travel to interviews - as well as a free one month ticket once you secure a job.Am I eligible for the scheme To be eligible for any of these offers, the customer must have been claiming Jobseekers Allowance or Universal Credit for - monthsor - months .How does it work Tickets for travel to interview:For jobseekers to obtain up to two freetickets per month to attend interviews, their local Job Centre issues them with a completed authorisation form which should then be taken to a local station where staff will issue a ticket .One month ticket once employment secured:If the jobseeker secures employment and wishes to apply for a free monthrsquos ticket, their local Job Centre will issue them with a completed authorisation form which should then be taken to a station where staff will issue a ticket .What does ScotRail say ScotRail Alliance Managing Director Alex Hynes said: ldquoFor people out of work, the cost of travelling to an interview can often be a barrier to ing to work.ldquoBy removing that barrier and providing help with the cost, we hope to be able to support people into work and grow Scotlandrsquos economy.ldquoThe support we offer to jobseekers is one of the ScotRail Alliancersquos best kept secrets ndash but I want as many people as possible to know about this opportunity."},{"url":null,"title":"bt-ee-plusnet-talktalk-major-phone-outage-reported-across-uk","story":"As of .pm, problems were reported on BT, TalkTalk, EE and Plusnet, with thousands taking to outage site DownDetector to highlight issues.Thousands of TalkTalk users have reported issues across the country.

Mr W. C. Howard, manager of Argo’s, suggested it at the first meeting of the Stromness and West Mainland Chamber of Commerce, in late June .The best time for it was the third week in July, to coincide with the Kirkwall monthly holiday and the Stromness Regatta, so it was opened by Provost George Robertson on July .Other than during the war, Stromness has always had to work hard to attract business. Provost Robertson said in his opening speech that the aim was “to keep Stromness very definitely on the shopping map” and he told an old Stromness story: “Said a business man to his neighbour, ‘How’s business the day, William ’ ‘Oh,’ replied he, ‘canna compleen, canna compleen – selt a Christian Herald, changed a penny and shawn a man whar the auld kirk is.#”The week was a resounding success. All the shops decorated their windows and offered prizes and discounts. About  flags filled the street, as everyone hung out what they could find. Merriman’s electrical shop, then half-way up Porteous Brae, hooked up loudspeakers to provide music for the passers-by.Even at such short notice, Stromness managed to get the “showies” to ert to the town. There was an amusement arcade in the Transit Shed, at the top of the North Pier, and the side-shows at the Market Green even included chairoplanes.The mystery bus tour was on Tuesday. Provost Robertson had suggested that the tour might take its passengers to “parts of the mainland you have never seen since you were last carted there to a Sunday School picnic ,  or  years ago”. He urged his audience to book but, of course, this didn’t happen and only one bus was laid on. Another five had to be hurriedly brought from Wishart’s Garage.On Wednesday there were sporting competitions at Ness, which culminated in a five-a-side hockey tournament. The men’s final, won by Dounby, was described in the Orkney Herald as being played “with a speed reminiscent of ice-hockey and an enthusiasm to win that might have been more appropriate on the battlefield”.The week also held the Stromness Regatta, a Swimming Gala, a Football Tournament, the County Sheepdog Trials and a Bring and Buy Sale in the North Kirk that raised £.The week ended, as it always has, with a fancy-dress parade. The -yard long procession was led by the Kirkwall City Pipe Band and followed by hundreds of excited spectators.  spectators lined the Market Green for the judging and presentation of prizes.In , the main attraction was the Wick Girls Pipe Band but there was plenty of home- grown entertainment. Nannie Gowans organised a concert by the youth of the town in the Town Hall. When her brother Johnnie was appointed Shopping Week organiser a few years later she ably assisted him. They are still remembered in Stromness for developing a bigger programme of events and bringing in big attractions, such as tightrope walkers, motorcycle display teams and the Globe of Death.There had not been enough time to organise the suggested art exhibition for the first Shopping Week but it was there in , organised by Stanley Cursiter, in the building now occupied by the Ell  Co Café.The Swimming Gala in the harbour included a water-polo match, “…in which it was dficult to know who was playing who” and a display of water-skiing but the big event was the March of Time cavalcade organised by the Young Farmers at the Market Green, showing how farming had developed over the centuries.“First of all came cultivation, beginning with the man with the spade and pick… We saw the genuine old wooden plough of our great-grandfathers…. The lovely and lovable Clydesdales drawing the long-boarded plough and the  tractor carrying its two-furrow at the tail and jogging along with a jaunty air.Sowing, harvesting, threshing and the farmhouse kitchen went through similar progressions, all with a commentary by JGS Flett from Harray.

We want to help them keep it up.“These survey results and the enthusiastic response to the Make Space for Nature campaign gives us confidence that Scotland is well placed to reverse the decline in ersity of animal and plant species in Scotland. As the need for nature is ever more apparent, the way Scotland recovers from COVID- could be one important way we secure a nature rich future for generations to come.”SNH is keen to encourage and support people to develop their interest, learn more and get involved in nature.

But we remain concerned that unconditional offers ndash particularly those with conditions attached ndash can pressure students into making decisions that may not be in their best interests, and reduce their choices.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: ldquoWe have long warned that certain types of unconditional offer are not in the best interests of young people and this report provides yet more evidence.ldquoOne of the clear problems with unconditional offers is that they can encourage students to undertake university courses which are not the best choice for them, and this leads to them becoming disengaged with their studies and ultimately dropping out.ldquoThe problem is that unconditional offers are used as a way of getting bums on seats in a fiercely competitive environment between universities.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK , said: ldquoIt is an important principle for universities to be able to decide independently which students they accept when factoring all of this in but alongside that comes a responsibility to explain why and how places are awarded, and to show the public and students why dferent types of offers are made.ldquoNo student should ever be rushed or pressured into a decision by the offer that they receive, and as a measure of commitment to this principle, universities have proactively adopted our Fair Admissions Agreement to suspend the practice of conditional unconditional offer-making during the Covid pandemic and supported the introduction of a temporary student stability measure over this recruitment cycle.copy -.

Bha athair, air an robh Raibeart mar ainm cuideachd, na mhaighstir-sgoile anns a’ Cheannmhor aig ceann an ear Loch Tatha. An dèidh dha sgoil athar fhàgail, chaidh Raibeart don oilthigh, an toiseach ann an Dùn Èideann, agus an uair sin ann an Cill Rìmhinn. Thàinig e a-mach mar sgoilear air leth de Sheann Ghreugais agus Laidinn.Bha Armstrong a-nise deiseil airson a bhith na mhinistear, agus chaidh e cho fada ʼs gun do dh’fhoillsich e dà shearmon. Ge-tà, an àite a bhith a’ cur a-staigh airson a bhith na mhinistear paraiste, dh’fhalbh e a Lunnainn.

Uill, bha ar laoch, Raibeart, dhen bheachd gun dèanadh esan faclair a cheart cho math, agus a cheart cho luath, riutha.Bha e trang leis an obair làitheil aige, agus cha robh cus ùine aige airson faclair a chur ri chèile. Ach, a dh’aindeoin sin, rinn e adhartas math. Ge-tà, nuair a bha e air a dhol cho fada ris an litir ‘M’, chaidh togalach an fhoillsicheir a losgadh gu làr. B’ fheudar do Raibeart an obair aige a thòiseachadh às ùr.Bha e gu math dìcheallach, agus chaidh am faclair aige fhoillseachadh ann an ochd ceud deug, fichead ʼs a còig .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin .

Inner Wheel has Clubs right across the island of Ireland including in Ballymena. The local Club recently celebrated its th anniversary, Patricia has been involved in her local Club for around  years and, most recently, was Club President. Patricia said: “It is an immense honour to have the opportunity to lead our organisation. Although somewhat daunted by the responsibility which comes with the role of Chair I am nonetheless excited by the prospect for the year ahead. “The ongoing global pandemic undoubtedly brings enormous challenges for our organisation but by embracing the opportunities which technology offers there are ways in which we can keep the spirit of Inner Wheel alive. “I am immensely encouraged by the way in which our members have already adapted to the new normality. The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months. She is planning to attend the International Inner Wheel Convention in Japur in India next Spring – subject, of course, to easing of travel restrictions. In the meantime she is planning a busy year of events – both ‘virtual’ and ‘physical’ - so that members can continue to give Service while enjoying Friendship. Inner Wheel is an international women’s organisation with over  members in over  countries. It is one of the largest women’s service voluntary organisations in the world. Founded in , the key aims of the organisation are to promote true friendship, encourage the ideals of personal service and foster international understanding.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

Her comments came as the Republic published its so-called green list of  countries from which travellers will not have to quarantine. It does not include Great Britain or the US.Read More Coronavirus quarantine: Your questions answered on confusing Northern Ireland travel regulations A land that#s on both green lists: it has to be Greenland... but would you holiday there Most of the countries on the Ireland list are also on the list of places from where people heading to Northern Ireland do not have to quarantine. There are, however, notable dferences, including France and Spain, which are on our list but not on the Republic#s. Likewise, some appear on the Ireland list but not the UK one, such as Estonia and Slovakia.Ms Gault said the primary concern was how people can get here in the first place, irrespective of quarantine issues.She added that in , the tourism spend was in the region of £billion, with some % generated from domestic, Republic of Ireland and GB visitors. The GB market remains our largest overseas market in terms of spend and numbers, she said. There are, she added, three main questions to consider in terms of attracting visitors from abroad. How can people get to Northern Ireland for a holiday  Ms Gault asked. How happy are visitors to travel  And will the local communities be happy to welcome them  Ms Gault said that Northern Ireland#s hoteliers were concentrating on island of Ireland visitors in the short-term, but they hope that, as the pandemic subsides, visitors from GB and further afield will . Visitors on the island can travel easily by land and are content to do so, she said.Tourists have been widely welcomed by local communities as the R number remains well contained north and south of the border.Moving to those beyond the island of Ireland, perhaps the most pertinent point is that access by air and sea is limited. Research has shown that international visitors, even those from Great Britain, are reticent about travelling to Ireland and appear to be looking at holidaying in .Ms Gault said that Covid clusters cause concern about people coming into communities.She added that the general consensus is that travel is starting to pick up on an all-Ireland basis and visitors from further afield are more likely to travel much later this year but may wait until .Ms Gault said that until leisure and business travel was given the green light, it is dficult to see how we can restore signicant levels of business.There is confusion about travelling, with essential travel abroad deemed as the only travel people should plan, she added. This in itself is leading to concern and having a negative effect on visitor sentiment. Recovery of the tourism industry will be slow.It is important Northern Ireland has access to markets which offer opportunity whilst maintaining control of the spread of Covid-, and that we are open for business once the overseas visitor is happy to travel again.Tourism expert Lyn Fawcett, whose family owned a string of venues on the north coast, said thatNorthern Ireland was not open to GB visitors, it would have a signicant impact on our overall business. About % of my business will be from GB and the rest is domestic, Mr Fawcett explained.At the moment I have people who have booked to come on holiday from England. If they#re forced to go into quarantine, they will not come.The other dimension is that we already have bookings from people from GB and we need to be able to honour those.Mr Fawcett, whose family owned Northern Counties, Fawcetts Royal and The Lismara Hotels in Portrush and The Strand Hotel in Portstewart, said the industry has suffered a setback which will be almost impossible to get over.Losing % of the year#s income for most businesses is a very big hole that has to be filled, he added.If we are closing the doors effectively to a number of countries, that will have a long-term impact. If we don#t get the GB traffic, that will have a major damaging effect on the industry.I don#t think that damage will be so greatit#s from other countries. The former Ulster University hospitality and tourism lecturer, who owns self-catering cottages on the Causeway Coast, said there were positives associated with so many people staycationing in Northern Ireland.There are very few places left in self-catering on the north Antrim coast, he said.People who#ve missed their holidays will probably do so in Northern Ireland and we will continue to be busy into September, October and November.It#s not all doom and gloom. Business is picking up and I#m experiencing a higher level of demand for those three months than I#ve had in previous years - and it#s entirely people from Northern Ireland.Mr Fawcett also said making all US visitors quarantine for  days was using a sledgehammer to crack a very small nut because they could be tested for Covid at the airport upon arrival. He added: You can insist on them bringing negative Covid test results, you can test their temperature at the airport and you can give them a test at the airport and ask them to self-isolate for  hours until the test comes through. Stormont health committee member Colin McGrath said the dfering approved flight lists were confusing.The advice on international travel isn#t clear from the Executive and across the island, so it#s little wonder that people are confused, the SDLP MLA added.

The Irish News has reported that  clusters linked to  positive cases of the virus have been identied through contact tracing since May . Six of these clusters had more than five positive cases of Covid- associated with them. Alliance health spokesperson Paula Bradshaw said the nature of those clusters must be revealed. Earlier this month a cluster of Covid- cases was identied in Limavady, believed to be linked to a house party were a karaoke microphone was passed around.The PHA has confirmed that another cluster has been identied in Ballymena and they are monitoring developments. A spokesperson said the PHA is aware of a number of cases in the Ballymena area that may be associated with a cluster.A cluster is defined as two or more cases among Covid- deriving from the same place with the onset of the illness within  days. Multiple cases of Covid- in a single household is not classed as an outbreak. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAlliance MLA Paula Bradshaw FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAlliance MLA Paula BradshawMs Bradshaw said she had asked questions about outbreaks in particular locations, but had been told these were just matters of increased transmission. The South Belfast MLA, who earlier this week cancelled a family holiday to Italy after confusion around travel guidance, said it was important to identy what was being learned from contact tracing. “Now it turns out that the recently publicised case near Limavady is one of sixteen since  May. The issue is we have not been informed about the nature of these clusters and, particularly, how they originated, Ms Bradshaw said. “A public health emergency needs public support and therefore good public information. That means the public must be fully informed about the types of behaviour which have proven particularly dangerous in terms of leading to super-spreading events.The Alliance MLA urged Health Minister Robin Swann to ensure the Public Health Agency publishes information about the nature of each cluster and what we can learn from it.A PHA spokesperson said clusters of cases were to be expected during the pandemic. The Public Health Agencywill not comment on inidual cases or go into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested, the spokesperson said.To date the majority of clusters that have occurred have been managed effectively through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.A Department of Health spokesperson said the contact, trace and protect approach had proved highly effective in preventing the further spread of Covid-.We must be aware that Covid- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading, the spokesperson said.

It was a late invitation so I hadn#t much time to buy a dress and I just couldn#t find anything. Eventually I saw this dress but it was quite expensive, over £. It fitted like a glove and I felt like a princess in it. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was meant to be and nothing  compared. My lovely parents splashed out and bought it for me, I was that desperate.At the formal my friend accidentally knocked over a candle and a flame flared up. Everyone jumped back and I caught my dress on something and ripped the netting.Later on I brought the dress to a dressmaker to have it repaired. She was to send away for some material to fix it but somehow time went by and I never picked it up. I lost touch with the dressmaker, so I suppose she eventually had a clear out and gave the dress to charity.She thought that was the end of it - until recently dropping into the Cancer Focus shop in Newtownstewart. There hanging up was my dress with a price tag of £ on it. Apparently it had just been donated, she explained.I recognised it straight away because the tear is still in it. I was totally amazed.Rachael was delighted to get the dress back to keep for its sentimental value. It#s still torn and damaged and it#s a size , so it doesn#t fit me anymore, but I love having it as a reminder of my granny, she added. She was very much one of a kind, she loved McDonald#s and drove a sporty Honda Civic! It#s her th anniversary this year.Belfast Most ReadLong lost formal dress of Northern Ireland woman found in charity shop Where were the  coronavirus clusters in Northern Ireland  PHA urged to reveal detailsm reasons to snub Michelle O#Neill: Northern Ireland can#t afford to lose visitors from GB, says tourism chiefJohn McAreavey slams Liverpool FC over Mauritius partnershipNorthern Ireland couple secretly recorded woman during years of #unrelenting# harassment,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Between  and , the victim was subjected to malicious reports, covert filming and a listening device, and her medical records were illegally accessed in a hospital.Alwyn Mageeand Marie Lindsayboth of Hillview Park, Enniskillen, admitted making  reports to police, the NSPCC and the victim#s workplace superiors.In addition, Magee abused his position as a member of staff at South West Acute Hospital to access confidential medical details of the victim and her family, and planted the listening device.Neither defendant appeared for sentencing, but the victim joined by video link from her solicitor#s office, with District Judge Eamon King remarking it was ironic she was present but her persecutors were not.Enniskillen Magistrates Court, sitting in Dungannon, heard the victim and Magee had a child together but separated in . He he had custody two weekends a month, and several afternoons a week.Harassment commenced the following year, with the victim hounded by both Magee and his partner, Lindsay.During this, he made  covert recordings, two of which involved him questioning the child on the victim#s movements.In , the victim discovered a listening device in the child#s schoolbag, which forensic examination established was activated by dialling a number to listen in. Calls were traced to Lindsay#s phone on  occasions, lasting a total of five hours  minutes.During interview Magee denied any knowledge of this until presented with telephone records. He and Lindsay maintained they were concerned for the child#s safety but it emerged he had custody on some of the dates the device activated.However, harassment was well under way long before this. Lindsay had anonymously contacted the NSPCC alleging the victim was physically and emotionally abusing the child, which was fully investigated and dismissed. An allegation of a fraud was also untrue, as were numerous reports to police.Lindsay fabricated complaints to the victim#s workplace manager, and during one stated she would let the community know.For several months in , Magee and Lindsay drove past the victim#s home at the same time every Sunday.A tablet owned by the defendants was found to contain recordings of the victim in her workplace.The offences specic to Magee, involved him accessing the personal medical records of the victim and her family, while he worked as a hospital laboratory assistant. The Western Trust launched an investigation and disciplinary proceedings, but Magee resigned before these were completed.The prosecutor referred the court to a heartfelt victim impact statement.

He previously said the project would cost an estimated £bn.Last month, however, it was revealed that no money had been spent on exploring the idea.Speaking to Sky News, Brandon Lewis said the bridge would improve connectivity and boost the economy.The Prime Minister has always been very clear about his passion for bridges, his determination to deliver improved infrastructure and, again, during coronavirus we saw the importance of connectivity for the whole of the United Kingdom, he said.We put in extra money to support ferries and airlines being able to continue to keep the connectivity for Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom [going]. More connectivity is good for the UK as a whole and it#s good for the economy and can deliver jobs.I think it is absolutely vital that we do the work to look at the feasibility and viability and how this can work. It would be an exciting project. Big infrastructure projects throughout history have been sometimes controversial, dficult, but they are the right thing to do.The M wasn#t a straightforward thing, but now no one could imagine le without it around London.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The Department of Health which operates the local test centre and several others in Northern Ireland confirmed that the local testing centre will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The testing site at City of Derry Rugby Club will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. googletag.cmd.push “Work is underway on behalf of the National Testing Programme to identy an alternative site and an announcement will be made in due course. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. googletag.cmd.push It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The first threat came in the rise of out of town shopping centres. I can remember the campaigns fought against them in Derry by local city centre retailers who argued it would suck the le out of the city centre. This battle to stop planning being granted for out of town centres was largely lost and we only have to look at Crescent Link to see the impact its had on retail footfall in the city centre. Then we had the advent of online retail which began nibbling at retail sales about  years ago. googletag.cmd.push This nibble has now become a feast. Prior to Covid-, online retail was certainly taking a big chunk out of disposable income. For anyone under  purchasing online from eBay Amazon and using PayPal was as normal as going up the town. Buying clothes, electronics, games etc on your phone for younger people was the norm rather than the exception. With Covid-, however, online retail has reached into every age group. With shops closed and fear of infection particularly amongst older people the rush online has been music to the ears of companies like Amazon. For Derry city, the problem is amplied. googletag.cmd.push Derry suffers from having an already dficult retail situation. We have the highest level of welfare dependency in the North and still rank the highest in any UK deprivation statistics. We also have the highest level of unemployment in the  council areas. This in turn means less disposable income for the local population so retailers have to compete for a smaller amount of money available. Our city centre is beautul but it really needs huge investment made. Carlisle Roadhas a few vacant sites and a number of vacant shops and really could benefit from some redevelopment.  There is a plethora of charity and pound shops which provide valuable employment and services to the most vulnerable but they also tell a story about our city and its spending power.  And when you see a landmark building like the Austin’s Building boarded up and the old Poundstretchers site on Bishop Street still not developed, it really doesnt bode well. And lets not even talk about the view from the Peace Bridge into Foyle Street which shows buildings with weeds growing out the windows. I could go on, but the city centre has been on a slow decline for the last  years and the financial crisis of  has really accelerated it. If there is not urgent action taken now and led by Derry and Strabane District Council, we might not have a city centre in . So how do we reimagine our city centre   Well one thing for sure is the recent announcement by DCSDC that a shortfall in their budget might have to be met with a -year double digits rates increase is not the answer. Such a move, in my opinion, would completely kill business owners operating in the city centre. And remember having a vibrant city centre is what drives tourism. It also drives student numbers. Students and tourists will only come to Derry is it is vibrant and safe. If we allow it to die then we kill tourism. We have to be very careful of what we do in the next  years. So, what could a post Covid- Derry city centre look like  For starters, I think we definitely need more outside space offered to shops and retailers. The whole vibe seems to be al fresco which is driven mainly by the belief that its harder to catch the virus outside. It also helps solve the capacity issue for many pubs restaurants etc. Of course, in continental Europe it rains a lot less but in Holland it rains  days a year and they have a lot more outside space use than us. Ive been to Liverpoola few times and they have as much rain as us but definitely more outside space.  I just hope council dont charge rates for this space. If we want people back to work and businesses generating profits to afford rates, we shouldnt overload their rates bills. I would also seriously look at taking traffic out of the city centre and creating a huge pedestrian zone from the top of Bishop Street straight down to the River Foyle. I would also pedestrianize from the bottom of Carlisle Road right up and including the whole of the Walled City.I would allow a bike lane. Post Covid-, people will want physical distance and what better way to do it than take traffic out all together from the city centre. Data from Living Streets suggests where the pedestrian experience has been improved, footfall has increased between  and %. Bear in mind there has been a % decline in footfall on the high street across the UK between  and . In Leicester for example, shop vacancy rates were five times higher on streets with higher levels of traffic and turnover in pedestrianised areas generally outperforms non pedestrian areas . Bear in mind that a report done by Sustrans titled ‘Bike Le ’ found that % of residents living in  UK citieswere keen to see more space made available on their high streets for people socialising cycling and walking. This was before Covid- and I would guess the % in now higher. Council government really need to look at the whole business rates issue and attempt to rebalance it. Some work is already being done on this and I know the Minister for Finance Connor Murphy is looking to launch something soon. Derry, however, should look at a scheme to encourage new businesses to take up space which includes a rates free period. We need to encourage new businesses to locate into the city centre. Ebrington is another exciting addition to the solution. We can expand the city centre across into Ebrington where there is plenty of outside space. We should also utilise the Guildhall Square on a permanent basis and its a perfect link to Ebrington. We really need to imagine a new city centre with many uses. We need to also develop more markets across the city. Markets bring football and offer small producers a change to sell their products. Covid offers many opportunities as well as challenges. During lockdown we saw a huge increase in the number of people working from home and living locally. Its likely that there will be less commuting to larger towns and cities so people will be spending more time in their immediate local area. Its up to us now to design a new city centre which meets the needs of people. The new high street city centre cant only be about retail. To think this way would be to ignore the clear trends in consumer behaviour and online retail. Sustans, an organisation which has researched this widely, said in a recent report: Re-establishing the role of the high streets as a hub for social connection and reinforcing and celebrating its roots and unique character could go a long way to encourage people to stay local and spend their money where they live. I would go further than that and suggest it could also attract the visitors and students Derry needs to become the vibrant city it aspires too. We need to reimagine our city centre. We have to repurpose large buildings for new uses and also consider housing provision as well. Public spaces like the Guildhall Squareneed remodelling to make more room for meeting, eating and retail.  All of this might mean changing rules in relation to the use of public space and licensing arrangements but we really have to change before our city centre dies. In summary, the current city centre isnt thriving and hasnt for  years. Consumer behaviour, out-of-town retail, online shopping and now Covid- have each had an impact. Its now time to tear the rule book up and imagine the city centre we want for the next  years and the reality is that it will be less about retail and more about making them somewhere where people want to be. It needs to be accessible fun and an exciting development. Lets hope our council appoint the right experts and design team who can hopefully create and enhance our city centre for social and civic use.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important. We must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fr Dallat said the support of the GAA community had ‘meant so much’ to Michael’s family. googletag.cmd.push “It’s obvious there just how much sport, and the lads and lassies involved, meant to him,” he said. “It meant so much to Margaret, Paul and Joseph this week, just to have them standing alongside them. “That’s what they were doing out there, just standing alongside people who they love and care for and saying, ‘we don’t know what to do here, but we’re going to stand alongside you anyway’. “That, in itself, is beautul, and it’s because Michael gathered people around him.” Michael’s ability to gather people around him formed a central part of Fr Dallat’s homily, and he spoke of how he was always able to make those around him feel ‘important’. “We have been blessed. It has been a joy to know him,” he told the congregation. “You only had to pass through the house over the last few days to see the love that this wee man has engendered in the time he has been with us. Eoghan Rua have arranged for a memory box to be presented to Michaels family. “Michael had some experience as a classroom assistant in Downpatrick, and the children loved him. He had an ability with children to gather them around and make them feel important. “The same is true here in Portstewart. It wasn’t only his peers he knew how to take care of and bring into the centre of the craic, but that was a gt as well.” Fr Dallat concluded by asking those who loved him to remember Michael for the joy he brought to others. “There are photographs and there are memories, but unfortunately, he won’t bound back into the house once more, looking for money to put petrol in the car for the next bit of the journey,” he said. “He was a man, who though small in stature, always dreamed big. He was someone who drew the love out of others. “Whatever name you have known him by, think for a moment about your favourite memory and thank God for the smile he has put on your face and for the love he has put in your heart.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

SDLP Councillor Shauna Cusack said young people have been holding parties and lighting fires at the former Foyle College site at Northland Road. Cllr Cusack said: This is a large site which unfortunately is very easily accessed. It is due to be the site for the new Ardnashee school with an estimated date of Spring  for the works to commence. We all know what happened with the old building when it had to be demolished last year following an arson attack and it seems the site has again become a magnet for anti social behaviour. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Cusack said that in recent weekslocal residents have reported large numbers of youths trying to access the site with drink. They have set up palettes for seating within the trees at the periphery of the site and can be heard partying into the early hours causing sleepless nights for the residents. The PSNI and the Council Community Safety Wardens have been in attendance and have witnessed evidence of drug taking also. This latest incident, which we all feared shows how these gatherings can escalate and get out of control engendering both themselves, others and surrounding property. I have been speaking with the authorities and directly with the Education Authority at the end of last week who had committed to removing materials and investigate private security to monitor the private site. googletag.cmd.push Meanwhile, I would ask parents and the public to play their part and either talk to your child about this area or report any trespass you see. While the obvious activities of underage drinking, drugs and now arson are very worrying we cannot forget the silent killer of Covid being transmitted when unmonitored crowds gather.

Three Mid Ulster District Council arts facilities will be lit up this weekend in recognition of the district’s frontline workers’ efforts during the Covid- pandemic. The Bridewell, Magherafelt, Ranfurly House, Dungannon and The Burnavon in Cookstown will light up red and white, the council colours, over the weekend. It comes after a motion, proposed by Deputy Chair, Meta Graham, at the council’s monthly meeting, received unanimous support. Cllr Graham wanted to publicly convey the council’s thanks to the workers who worked tirelessly outside the spotlight during the pandemic. “We all clapped deservedly week after week for our remarkable and brave NHS to show our support and to thank them for the sacrices they made during this dficult time,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “However, I think our thanks and appreciation need to be extended further to include all of those who are sometimes overlooked and quite often taken for granted. “We all need to pause and remember that while we may not have had everything we wanted during this crisis, thanks to the work of these dedicated workers, we certainly had everything we needed. “This gesture is a small token of our gratitude, appreciation and thanks to all those who have so selflessly kept Mid Ulster going over the last  months, often at considerable risk to themselves. We owe you all a great debt.” googletag.cmd.push Farmers, factory workers, delivery drivers, lorry drivers, postal workers, retail workers, the PSNI, the NIFRS, small local shops, council staff, volunteers and community groups were among those included by Cllr Graham.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for the club confirmed the news last night after a day of uncertainly regarding the potential fixture. Originally scheduled to face League of Ireland champions Dundalk, Celtic were expecting to welcome the Lilywhites to Celtic Park, but quarantine restrictions ended their hopes of playing the game with anyone coming into the Republic from the UK having to self isolate for  days. With the League of Ireland set to start next Friday, that would have been impossible for the champions. googletag.cmd.push That opened the door for Derry City to step into the glamour friendly, with reports suggesting that former Celtic and City star Paddy McCourt was heavily involved in organising the game. The hope was that, as Derry City would only be travelling to another part of the UK from Northern Ireland, they are not bound by the same restrictions. That hope continued into yesterday, with the club hoping to finalise arrangements for the game, but they were dashed by the FAI last night. With City set to travel to Dublin to face St. Patricks Athletic, just eight days after the proposed game in Scotland, the same -day rule which scuppered Dundalks plans, also appear to have stopped Derry, despite technically being in the UK. googletag.cmd.push Instead of Celtic, City hope to finalise their pre-season plans with a game against Northwest neighbours Finn Harps behind closed doors at the Brandywell tomorrow night. Declan Devines men faced Cltonville in midweek and drew -, with the City boss running his eye over three new trialists. The Candystyripes face Sligo Rovers in the resumption of the league season next Friday. Celtic, meanwhile, who now wont have Irish opposition this weekend, finished off their mini tour of France with a - defeat at French giants Paris St-German, with superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both on the scoresheet in the Parc des Princes encounter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.Politicians are keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take the lead and ensure that a high class leisure community facility, which has been talked about in the resort for decades, is finally delivered.They insist that the provision of modern accommodation in the heart of Newcastle is long overdue and that the lsquoonce in a generationrsquo opportunity to deliver a modern, indoor facility must not be squandered.Some politicians say it is also critical to maximise every available square inch of space at the site to deliver a high quality centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11605966.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This certainly brought a real global feel to events.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

But we remain concerned that unconditional offers ndash particularly those with conditions attached ndash can pressure students into making decisions that may not be in their best interests, and reduce their choices.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: ldquoWe have long warned that certain types of unconditional offer are not in the best interests of young people and this report provides yet more evidence.ldquoOne of the clear problems with unconditional offers is that they can encourage students to undertake university courses which are not the best choice for them, and this leads to them becoming disengaged with their studies and ultimately dropping out.ldquoThe problem is that unconditional offers are used as a way of getting bums on seats in a fiercely competitive environment between universities.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK , said: ldquoIt is an important principle for universities to be able to decide independently which students they accept when factoring all of this in but alongside that comes a responsibility to explain why and how places are awarded, and to show the public and students why dferent types of offers are made.ldquoNo student should ever be rushed or pressured into a decision by the offer that they receive, and as a measure of commitment to this principle, universities have proactively adopted our Fair Admissions Agreement to suspend the practice of conditional unconditional offer-making during the Covid pandemic and supported the introduction of a temporary student stability measure over this recruitment cycle..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Students with lower grades after unconditional offers  umore likely to drop out u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
