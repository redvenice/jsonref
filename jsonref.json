His other exes include American comic Sarah Silverman and actress Rachel McAdams.Others who have returned or rejected honours include John Lennon, who was awarded an MBE in 1965 but returned it in protest at Britain\u0027s foreign policy and the Vietnam War. Alan Bennett turned down a CBE in 1988 and rejected a knighthood in 1996 as it wouldn\u0027t \u0027suit\u0027 him.The actor\u0027s OBE decision was prompted by researching the history of his native Wales and its relationship with the British state for his 2017 Raymond Williams lecture.In the lecture he called for Welsh Independence, saying: \u0027Who speaks for Wales?Nobody\u0027, adding:  \u0027Wales has suffered and is suffering acute economic, political, and cultural strains, and by the fact of history has to try and resolve them in a world of crude power relationships and distant parliaments\u0027.He also said that Wales\u0027 history is 1,500 years of outside interference.\u0027It is the story of a nation that never was, struggling to be. The story of a people continually shocked and shaped and acted upon from outside.  \u0027From the Romans to the Anglo-Saxons to the Normans, they all came to fracture us, to control us, to subdue us. To bend us to their will. They built their roads, they built their walls, they built their castles.\u0027They changed our language, they changed our faith, they changed our sense of ourselves. And all the while, we tried to live in the shadow of their powers\u0027.  Michael Sheen has previously revealed his relationship with Sarah Silverman indirectly ended because of Brexit and Donald Trump\u0027s presidency.In the lecture he argued that Wales had voted to leave the EU because of a slanted view fed to them from England.He said: \u0027It was in the face of being disconnected from its own history, and denied opportunity to explore its own modern identity in the context of that history. The dragon had no voice so it spoke through the mouth of St George. \u0027When it comes to the Brexit vote - ‘For Wales - see England\u0027. That, infamously, was all that was written as the entry for Wales in the 1888 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. ‘For Wales - see England.’"},{"url":null,"title":"WHO says coronavirus pandemic not necessarily big one","story":"Share this articleShare this articleWHO warns Covid-19 pandemic is \u0027not necessarily the big one\u0027 | World news | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Hilaria blames decade long Spanish grift people misrepresenting me","story":"Share this articleHilaria Baldwin Talks Spain, Boston, Alec and Instagram - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Questions Britains decision drop two dose vaccine regimen","story":"Share this article The Government\u0027s joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (JCVI) today recommended a single dose of either vaccine should be given to as many vulnerable people as possible, rather than sticking to the two-dose strategy.Professor Wei Shen Lim, chairman of the JCVI, said that with Covid infection rates currently at a high level, the \u0027immediate urgency is for rapid and high levels of vaccine uptake\u0027.He said that after a first dose people acquire a high level of protection, and the JCVI therefore recommends delivery of the initial dose should be prioritised for both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines.He told a Downing Street data briefing: \u0027This will allow the greatest number of eligible people to receive vaccine in the shortest time possible and that will protect the greatest number of lives.\u0027A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said: \u0027Everyone will still receive their second dose and this will be within 12 weeks of their first. The second dose completes the course and is important for longer term protection.\u0027 Former Prime Minister Tony Blair – who had been calling for the Government to switch to the single-dose strategy for weeks – welcomed the move. \u0027The trial results make the case for using all available vaccines to vaccinate people with the first dose, without holding back a second dose for each person, overwhelming,\u0027 he said. \u0027The first dose gives a high level of immunity – enough to halt hospital admissions – and the second dose is in any event at its most effective 23 months after the first, by which time we will have extra supplies of the vaccine to cover second doses.\u0027In addition, the Government should consider urgently: acceleration of the vaccination programme. Of course, 1m vaccinations a week is remarkable by normal standards. \u0027But given the rates of transmission and the costs of lockdown, we need to do much more. Given the advantages of the AstraZeneca vaccine in terms of simplicity to administer – like the flu jab – we should surely be using every available potential resource including all pharmacies, occupational health capacity and those suitable to be trained fast to administer vaccines and increase the rate of vaccination.\u0027And we should think about greater flexibility in the plan, with vaccination of groups most likely to transmit the virus and hotspot areas as well as age and vulnerability.\u0027Scientists have welcomed the decision, saying it will allow greater \u0027flexibility\u0027 in the vaccination programme.  Commenting on the decision, Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, said: \u0027The decision to allow both the currently UK authorised vaccines to be given with a greater delay between doses to maximise the numbers getting one dose as rapidly as possible is a sensible one.\u0027It cannot have been an easy decision, since the evidence on the efficacy of one dose was more limited, but the crisis in the UK requires more than the usual regulatory approach.\u0027Professor Robert Read, head of clinical and experimental sciences within medicine at the University of Southampton, added: \u0027JCVI has advised that whilst we should be prepared to give people the second dose, it is acceptable to give that within 12 weeks of the first dose. This allows some much-needed flexibility in a programme as big as this.\u0027Ian Jones, professor of virology at the University of Reading, added: \u0027A level of immunity sufficient to prevent severe disease can be generated after only one inoculation of this vaccine so the revised JCVI advice to prioritise giving those at risk their first dose is a sensible idea.\u0027It will allow more people in this group to be treated with initial supplies, reduce the threat of hospitalisation from Covid-19, and accelerate the return to normality.\u0027Lawrence Young, professor of molecular oncology at Warwick Medical School, said: \u0027To maximise the number of at-risk groups receiving the vaccine, the first dose will be given to as many people as possible with the second dose being delayed for up to 12 weeks. This will allow the 100million vaccine doses ordered by the UK Government to be rolled out to as many people as possible starting as soon as next week.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Cornwall holiday lettings firm apologises encouraging Covid rule breaches","story":"Share this articlePeople in tier four \u0027encouraged to rent holiday homes in tier two Cornwall\u0027 | Metro News"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry Meghan Markles episode 30m podcast ranked whale noises","story":"Share this articleHarry and Meghan\u0027s £30million Archewell Audio podcast series beaten by show that sends people to sleep in Spotify charts"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1fce7994990c7569ca7185f49b8110fa7c8f387/0_107_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5572434bfe8aa761331ee856c55f8735","title":"inside oxfords coronavirus vaccine development","story":"From a small discovery to producing at scale, photojournalist David Levene documents the groundbreaking work of the scientists of Oxford University during the development of a vaccine which is now poised for approval by medicines regulatorsFrom the moment the coronavirus spilled out of China and spread around the world, the great hope for the return of normal life lay with safe and effective vaccines. While wearing masks and washing hands helped to reduce the flood of infections, they would never be enough to hold back the tide. Social distancing – a phrase that does nothing to convey the hardship of the act – suppresses the virus, no doubt. But what kind of life is a life lived apart?In response to the pandemic, the first great shock of the 21st century, scientists around the world came together in a staggering effort to tackle the crisis. No element of that work has been more impressive than the rapid development and testing of vaccines. To have shots in the arms of the most vulnerable people, which protect them against a virus unheard of 12 months ago, is an achievement worth reflecting upon.Scientists at Oxford University were among the small number of teams at the forefront of the race to find a Covid vaccine. In the space of 10 months, they designed and manufactured a candidate vaccine and proved its safety and efficacy through rigorous clinical trials in tens of thousands of volunteers in multiple countries. The shots are now being churned out in their millions, and by agreement with Oxford’s partner, AstraZeneca, will be sold at cost price to poorer countries.It all starts at the Jenner institute at Oxford University. Named after Edward Jenner, the 18th-century pioneer of immunisations, the institute ranks as one of the world’s premier vaccine research centres.Step one was to design the vaccine. In modern vaccine research facilities, much of this work is performed on a computer. On the morning of Saturday 11 January, within hours of the virus’s genetic sequence being published online, a team led by Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at Oxford, downloaded the code as a text file. They found the genetic instructions for the “spike” protein that studs the surface of the virus. This tiny club-like protein is swiftly recognised by the immune system.The Oxford vaccine is based on a virus that causes common colds in chimpanzees. This adenovirus is engineered so that it cannot replicate in human cells, meaning it cannot cause an infection. It is then modified further to carry the genetic instructions for the coronavirus spike protein. A shot of the vaccine releases vaccine virus particles into the body. Once inside, these particles enter cells and deliver their cargo of spike protein instructions. The cells then start to make spike proteins – each one a tiny, harmless fragment of the coronavirus – and these are ferried to the surfaces of the cells. Protruding like red flags, the immune system swiftly spots them. It raises an army of antibodies and T cells that are then primed to fight the coronavirus.As scientists at the Jenner institute ran tests in the lab and arranged for the necessary animal studies, the clinical biomanufacturing facility geared up to produce the medical-grade doses that would be needed for human trials. It is a meticulous, multi-staged process performed under increasingly stringent clean room conditions to ensure none of the raw materials, the final doses or vials become contaminated before they reach trial participants.The work starts with a strand of DNA brought across the car park from the Jenner institute. The DNA contains the genetic instructions for the vaccine adenovirus, complete with the code for the spike protein. Add this to modified human cells and they will take up the instructions and churn out adenovirus vaccine particles. Eventually, the cell makes so many that the vaccine particles burst out.The step is repeated multiple times. The vaccine particles that erupt from the single cell are added to a fresh batch of modified human cells, infecting those and producing yet more vaccine adenovirus. These are then added to more human cells, and on it goes, until a decent stock of sterile vaccine doses has been built up. Only genetically modified human cells can make the vaccine because these alone contain a gene, named E1, that the adenovirus needs to replicate.Each batch of vaccine made this way is purified to remove the ruptured cells that litter the nutrient-rich liquid. But another step is needed before the doses are ready for awaiting arms. Some adenovirus particles are duds: they assemble as empty shells that are missing their DNA. To separate them out, the liquid is spun down in a centrifuge. The valuable DNA-filled adenovirus particles settle into a band from which doses can then be taken, ready to administer as jabs.The Oxford scientists launched trials in Britain and around the world. To make enough doses for the volunteers, they sent “starter material” to factories far and wide – to Advent in Rome, Halix in the Netherlands, and the Serum Institute of India. Those who signed up for the trials were randomly assigned to receive the Oxford vaccine or a control vaccine. Most received two full shots, four weeks apart, but others received a half dose followed by a full dose a month later.Throughout the trial, clinicians on the team took blood samples from the participants to measure how their immune systems responded. But whether the vaccine worked would only become clear with time: who went on to fall ill with the virus? The vaccinated group or the control?Oxford Biomedica is manufacturing tens of millions of doses of the vaccine on behalf on AstraZeneca. Production involves various stages, starting with a vial of a frozen master bank of cells, which are thawed out and transferred into larger and larger solutions of media, each time being given time to grow. This takes several weeks until eventually there is enough vaccine to fill a 1,000-litre bioreactor. The solution then goes through a process of separation, purification and concentration before being frozen into 15-litre bags which are stored in special trays, ready to be transferred into inidual dose vials at a fillfinish house at a different location.At Wockhardt in Wrexham, one of the largest generic pharmaceutical companies in the UK, the vaccine that was manufactured at Oxford Biomedica and developed by the Oxford Vaccine Group is transferred into vials before being packaged ready for distribution.In December, following 11 intense months of vaccine development, manufacture and trials, the Oxford vaccine is poised for approval by medicines regulators. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, has been conducting a rolling review of clinical trials data so it can reach a decision swiftly. Other regulators will perform their own assessments.Upon approval, a major operation will swing into action to distribute the vaccine from storage facilities to countries around the world. Here, the Oxford vaccine has an advantage. Two other frontrunner vaccines, from PfizerBioNTech and the US National Institutes of HealthModerna, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures until shortly before they are used. This makes distribution of the shots a formidable challenge in some parts of the world. The Oxford vaccine isn’t as fragile and can be stored for long periods at 2C to 4C, or standard refrigeration temperatures. The Oxford vaccine is much cheaper too: about one-tenth of the cost of the other two.AstraZeneca, Oxford’s industrial partner, has agreed a deal to supply the vaccine at about £2 a dose through Covax, a system set up by the vaccine alliance Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization, to ensure all countries, rich and poor, have equitable access to tests, treatments and vaccines. Delivery of the first 300m doses should begin by the end of the year, with 2bn shots available by the end of 2021. A separate agreement with the Serum Institute of India – the world’s largest vaccine producer – secures 400m doses before the end of 2020.Only once the shots reach people’s arms will the benefits be felt from this staggering and unprecedented scientific effort. There was a time when the cavalry brandished sabres and rifles. Today they arrive bearing needles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30b25ff371ae9e1a064868f81421e565b23bdb03/35_0_7372_4425/master/7372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6138527576388567796dad6e388904","title":"face off the best guardian portraits of 2020 in pictures","story":"From Jeremy Vine in an alley to Sarah Lucas with a bouquet of breasts, here are some of the people who graced the  during the year that went tits up ...

Aldi is Britain’s fifth largest supermarket with more than 900 stores and 36,000 employees.Giles Hurley, the chief executiveof Aldi UK, said: “We are expecting significant sales growth in 2021 as we open new stores and bring Aldi to more locations across the UK. With the vast majority of our grocery products now coming from British suppliers, our growth will lead to additional jobs and investment in our UK supply chain.”Aldi, which sources its core range of fresh meat, eggs, milk, butter and cream from British suppliers, said the new commitment would create opportunities for hundreds of UK-based food and drink producers.It singled out Manchester Drinks Company, whose partnership with Aldi began in 2015 to supply a range of gins and gin liqueurs. Its new site in Yorkshire employs 19 people.Richard Benjamin, a co-owner of Manchester Drinks Company, said: “Our new contract with Aldi is a fantastic opportunity to showcase our flavoured gins and liqueurs to shoppers across the country, and will help to provide stability for our business in an uncertain climate.”Aldi introduced the immediate payment terms for small suppliers at the start of the coronavirus crisis and will now continue until the end of next year. This means it will continue to process payments for suppliers with an annual turnover of less than £1m with Aldi as soon as they are submitted.Aldi announced in September that it planned to create another 4,000 jobs with the opening of 100 stores and the trial of a click and collect service as part of a big investment drive in the UK.The new jobs are in addition to 3,000 permanent roles it created this year after grocery sales surged during the pandemic.

The coronavirus pandemic shook the world of business and economics to its core and continues to have profound, often unpredictable effects, some of them permanent. It hasn’t all been about Covid-19 though. 2020 also witnessed the usual corporate chicanery, deal-making and scandal. There were world-changing cultural and political moments, landmark departures and arrivals as well as, of course, some pocket-stretching pay packets. Here is a review of the year in business.The shift to buying goods and services online accelerated during the pandemic. Any company that could deliver essential goods to the door or provide digital services became instantly indispensable. Supermarkets moved quickly to increase online delivery slots, and took on thousands of extra workers to help meet the additional demand.Amazonwas a big beneficiary as non-essential shops were forced to close and people stayed at home. Skyrocketing demand helped its founder-boss, Jeff Bezos, increase his net worthby $13bn (£10bn) in a single day to take his personal wealth to an unprecedented $189bn.. His workers didn’t fare quite so well.It was an even better year than normal to be a multi-billionaire, in fact. Ten of them increased their combined wealth by $400bn.Increased hygiene protocols paid off for Dettol-maker Reckitt Benckiser, although it did have to warn people against ingesting its disinfectant to combat Covid-19 after the US president Donald Trump floated the idea.The video-conferencing service Zoom emerged from relative obscurity to become a household name valued at about $100bn. “You’re on mute!” became a pandemic catchphrase.Online gambling companies ended 2020 worth more than they were at the beginning of the year. After an initial hit caused by the suspension of sports, bored punters flocked to online poker, roulette and slot machines.Many homebuyers were handed a boost, thanks to the chancellor’s stamp duty holiday.Other winners included some of those with political connections and contacts with a Chinese face mask supplier. Hundreds of millions of pounds of contracts were handed out, with next to no scrutiny, sparking allegations of cronyism.Several industries are facing an existential threat, putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk.Hospitality has borne the brunt, prompting warnings that tens of thousands of pubs, restaurants, bars and hotels could disappear. Pub groups such as Marston’s and Greene King cut jobs, while the nightclub firm Deltic filed for administration. Worse could follow with the lucrative Christmas period ruined for many.The picture is similarly bleak in travel, tourism and leisure. By early October, more than 40 airlines had gone bust. Refused a government bailout, billionaire Sir Richard Branson had to prop up Virgin Atlantic with a £1.2bn rescue package, including £200m of his own money. EasyJet denied it faced collapse.British Airways lost a staggering £5bn in the first nine months of the year, while tour operator TUI announced losses of £1.8bn. In entertainment, Cineworld shut UK and US cinemas indefinitely, while many live music and theatre businesses face oblivion.Deserted high streets wreaked havoc on retailers, particularly those deemed non-essential, triggering a string of administrations. The billionaire Philip Green’s retail empire Arcadia collapsed into administration, as did Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston.And let’s not forget the estimated 3 million people, such as some self-employed, who have seen limited or no benefit from government measures to support businesses and jobs.This all made for some mind-blowing and unwelcome economic and financial milestones.As global trade slowed, so did demand for oil, with mind-boggling results. The price of US oil briefly moved into negative territory, as traders paid to be rid of unwanted barrels rather than incur storage costs.The pandemic allowed some businesses – and their staff in particular – to shine. Supermarket workers, cleaners and delivery drivers emerged as some of the true heroes of the crisis.In the early days, industrials rallied round in a wartime-style effort, with the likes of Airbus, Rolls-Royce and McLaren joining the Ventilator Challenge to produce thousands of medical ventilators that, thankfully, have not been needed in the quantities feared.Fashion firms including Burberry made PPE, while the likes of the chemicals firm Ineos and craft beer firm BrewDog churned out hand sanitiser.You don’t often hear three cheers for Big Pharma but the likes of Pfizer and AstraZeneca have won public goodwill thanks to swift work producing vaccines.Retailers paid back £1.8bn in state support that they did not need, including Sainsbury’s, Asda, B\u0026ampM, Aldi, Tesco and Morrisons.Away from coronavirus, the Black Lives Matter movement led many businesses to engage more seriously with racial discrimination and inequality, but progress has been slow and critics have warned firms must wake up to race issues.2020 spawned tales of skulduggery worthy of the late John Le Carre. In January, fugitive former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn told of his dramatic escape from incarceration in Japan. Accused of financial misconduct, Ghosn was smuggled to Lebanon thanks to an elaborate plot that involved him hiding in an audio equipment box.Tidjane Thiam, one of the stars of banking, was ousted as boss of Swiss bank Credit Suisse after a saga involving corporate espionage, an alleged car chase and bitter personal vendettas.The payment processing firm Wirecard enjoyed the backing of the entire German financial establishment as it tried every trick in the book to discredit Financial Times reporters who eventually unmasked the company as a fraudulent house of cards.British firms played their part, too. Aston Martin was revealed to have close links to a “sock puppet” PR firm questioning the green credentials of electric vehicles.Then there was the furore over fast fashion firm Boohoo and its ties to garment factories in Leicester and Pakistan, where workers were allegedly underpaid and exposed to unsafe working conditions.The fallout from the collapse of London Capital \u0026amp Finance, costing investors £236m, cast significant doubt on the efficacy of the financial watchdog, the FCA.Covid-19 subdued merger and acquisition activity but the US graphics card specialist Nvidia swooped for Cambridge-based chipmaker Arm Holdings, in a $40bn deal that sparked concern about the future of a rare British tech world-leader.The ticket resale firm Viagogo announced a $4bn takeover of rival StubHub, only to see the British Competition \u0026amp Markets Authority step in and threaten to scupper the whole thing. The deal hangs in the balance.After months of uncertainty, British Steel was eventually sold to the Chinese firm Jingye, securing the future of steelmaking in Scunthorpe.As the UK considers a crackdown on gambling, the US is opening up. The Las Vegas casino firm Caesars grabbed William Hill with a £2.9bn takeover. Meanwhile, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, completed a $12.3bn merger with Canada’s The Stars Group, creating the world’s largest online gambling company.As the year drew to a close, the security firm G4S accepted a £3.8bn offer from its US rival Allied Universal Security Services.Tesla’s founder, Elon Musk, took the first steps on the road towards a controversial $55.8bn pay bonanza. It hinges on some tough targets, including Tesla reaching a market value of $650bn. The electric car firm zoomed through that barrier earlier this month following a remarkable and sustained rise.In the UK, Matthew Moulding, the chief executive of the e-commerce firm The Hut Group, was in line for £830m in performance-related shares thanks to its strong performance since listing. He claims to have made 74 staff millionaires too.Even before the pandemic boosted Ocado’s fortunes, its boss, Tim Steiner, scooped £54m in share price-related bonuses.It’s hard to believe that Rishi Sunak only became chancellor of the exchequer in February. He was briefly flavour of the month when handing out more than £210bn in Covid relief to fund the furlough scheme and initiatives such as eat out to help out. His star has fallen a little since then and he faces the tough task of managing the finances during a recession.As Sunak arrived, the Bank of England governor Mark Carney bowed out after seven years overseeing a post-banking crisis British economy, with his reputation pretty much intact. Andrew Bailey succeeded him at Threadneedle Street.Sharon White became chair of John Lewis Partnership in February.

Only those with exams in summer will receive remote tuition that week, mainly years 11 and 13, with other year groups having an extended holiday.Secondary schools throughout England will remain closed to most pupils the following week, beginning 11 January, with only the exam years and other eligible pupils allowed inside schools and colleges while other years are taught remotely.From 18 January all secondary year groups are expected to be back being taught in person, although Williamson said the DfE would review the areas most affected by 18 January, meaning that secondaries and primaries could remain closed to most pupils for an extended period.School leaders welcomed the delay and supported the greater flexibility to prepare for the mass testing of students and staff. But many expressed anger at the government’s slow decision-making. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “This is another last-minute mess, which could so easily have been avoided if the government had listened to school leaders before the holidays.“Instead, back then, schools that wanted to shift to remote learning were threatened with legal action. Now we have a situation where the government is instructing schools to reduce the amount of teaching time available.“If we’d had the freedom to take action before the holidays, we might have been in a position to have more schools open for more pupils. School leaders will be baffled, frustrated and justifiably angry tonight.”Williamson said students with BTec external assessments or other exams in January would be expected to attend in person, as headteachers said the timetable would mean further lost learning for those sitting exams later in the year.Jules White, the headteacher of Tanbridge House secondary school in West Sussex, said: “It seems inevitable that exams will be abandoned as they cannot be conducted fairly. Hard-working students deserve clarity and the DfE must face up to the harsh reality that exams such as GCSEs, BTecs and A-levels cannot go ahead. They must set out a credible grading process to avoid the shambolic scenes of last summer.”Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said Williamson’s plans for school-wide testing had failed.“If the government had acted quicker, followed the science, and given schools the support that they needed throughout this pandemic, we wouldn’t be facing a new year with this new wave of infections and huge disruption to the lives of pupils, their families and staff across our education system,” Green said.“The government have lost control of the virus, and it’s children and young people across the country who are paying the price.”YouGov found support for closures was highest among those in London and the south, while two-thirds of Conservative voters also backed the move.Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, is to send an updated letter to vice-chancellors outlining the government’s plan to review return dates for the majority of students, with some unlikely to return until February.The government wants students to show two recent negative Covid tests before being able to use campus facilities or participate in in-person teaching, or alternatively to self-isolate for 10 days.Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said: “Keeping learning online until Easter would help lower rates of transmission and ensure a consistent learning experience, but the government continues to be fixated on forcing students and staff into lecture theatres and classrooms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7912fc2767fbad09c1d87eae6b0541acb6500c6/0_223_3666_2200/master/3666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f48d3e3d4b318fb56f70899822931f2","title":"we cannot make it without science greta thunberg says climate experts are being ignored","story":"Climate specialists not being listened to despite Covid showing importance of following science, activist saysClimate experts are not being listened to despite the coronavirus pandemic highlighting the importance of following science, the environmental activist Greta Thunberg has said.The Swedish teenager argued that the Covid-19 crisis had “shone a light” on how “we cannot make it without science”, but people were “only listening to one type of scientist”.Her comments came in a joint interview with the author Margaret Atwood, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday as part of the two-times Booker prize-winning writer’s guest-editing of the Today programme.Thunberg was asked if the pandemic’s impact on people’s appreciation of science would have an effect on climate information.“It could definitely have. I think this pandemic has shone a light on how … we are depending on science and that we cannot make it without science,” Thunberg said.“But of course, we are only listening to one type of scientist, or some types of scientist, and, for example, we are not listening to climate scientists, we’re not listening to scientists who work on bioersity and that, of course, needs to change.”The environmental campaigner expressed scepticism when questioned about nations’ pledges to reduce their carbon emissions, such as China, which has committed to reach net zero by 2060.“That would be very nice if they actually meant something,” Thunberg said. “We can’t just keep talking about future, hypothetical, vague, distant dates and pledges. We need to do things now. And also net zero … that is a very big loophole, you can fit a lot in that word ‘net’.”Thunberg said the election of Joe Biden as US president, who has pledged to rejoin the Paris climate agreement on the first day of his presidency, sent a signal that “it could be a good start of something new”.“Let’s hope that it is like that, and let’s push for it to become like that,” she said.Elsewhere in the interview, Thunberg said she tried to ignore content on Twitter, adding: “If I were to spend my time trying to defend myself, I wouldn’t be doing anything else.”She said it was great to be back at school after a period of campaigning and that she loved studying.The coronavirus pandemic has in recent months prevented the Fridays for Future movement that Thunberg inspired from holding its mass rallies, which started as a solo protest outside Sweden’s parliament in Stockholm in August 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0841abae3aba8000256f0d5896357bb3e63949e7/0_0_2000_1335/master/2000.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6471e0b8e59b8c9f9cdcc5c97f8cff6d 720w","title":"newcastle united liverpool premier league match report","story":"The final Premier League match of 2020 ended with Liverpool three points clear at the top of the table but only after Jürgen Klopp’s defending champions were made to look distinctly mortal by a wounded Newcastle side determined to prove a point.After a barrage of recent criticism Steve Bruce had said he wanted to shut a few people up. On the eve of his 60th birthday, the home manager’s wish was granted thanks to a creditable draw which will doubtless have gone down well with his old friends at second-placed Manchester United.Securing it necessitated some heroics from Newcastle’s vastly improved goalkeeper Karl Darlow while Liverpool dominated possession and Mohamed Salah missed a couple of chances that, nine times out of 10, he would have expected to convert but Bruce’s team also had their moments.It was easy to forget the fallout from a Covid-19 outbreak that saw 19 Newcastle players and back-room staff test positive for the virus has left arguably their best player, Allan Saint-Maximin, and the captain, Jamaal Lascelles, still sidelined by fatigue.Saint-Maximin is convalescing in France but, were he watching on television, the winger would surely have enjoyed Newcastle’s unusually positive performance. Bruce has been criticised – heavily – for negative tactics but, although he opted for a back five and they certainly did their fair share of defending, his gameplan proved unexpectedly adventurous.Perhaps hoping to expose the inexperience of the centre-half Nathaniel Phillips, Newcastle pressed high up the pitch and Allison swiftly looked relieved to see Callum Wilson head narrowly wide after meeting Jacob Murphy’s free-kick.Wilson was soon at it again, this time sashaying past Phillips and seeming set to score until Fabinho retrieved the situation, contributing a tremendous block that deflected the striker’s shot over the bar.Liverpool waited until Wednesday lunchtime before flying to Tyneside and they started as if behind schedule. It was 16 minutes before they mustered a shot on target, a gentle effort from James Milner that sailed straight into Darlow’s arms.If the tempo was nothing like as intense as expected and some of Liverpool’s initial passing went a little awry, Bruce could not remotely afford to relax.The Merseysiders might have begun in strangely dozy mode but they still offered little reminders of the adage about form being temporary but class permanent.A wonderful cameo involving Trent Alexander-Arnold bisecting Newcastle’s defence and picking out Sadio Mané with the most incisive of cross-field passes proved a case in point.For a moment it looked as if Darlow could be under severe threat but despite Salah and Milner working the ball back to Alexander-Arnold the right-back could not quite polish off the move on the volley.Newcastle generally second-guessed Liverpool’s manoeuvres pretty well, closing players down assiduously but, as half-time beckoned, the champions began asserting themselves on the break.A typically intelligent counterattack concluded with Darlow extending a hand and, quite brilliantly, erting Salah’s sidefooted shot wide after he connected with Jordan Henderson’s cross.Back on the Newcastle bench for the first time after missing the first part of this season with injury, Martin Dubravka seems destined to face a struggle to reclaim his place as first-choice keeper.After being slightly the superior side for much of the first 45 minutes, Newcastle were beginning to sense the power balance gradually tilting in Liverpool’s direction.It took DeAndre Yedlin to slide in with an important interception to deny Salah another clear shot on goal and a second stunning save from Darlow to keep Roberto Firmino’s header out following Mané’s volleyed cross.The second half had Liverpool increasing their growing possession quotient and the increasingly influential Mané directing a header fractionally off target but, still, Newcastle defended robustly.If Klopp had reason for mild optimism it will have been slightly tempered by the need for Fabinho to watch his step after the central defender was booked for a shameless body check on Yedlin as the right wing-back accelerated forward with menace.Even so, Salah should have scored after being smartly put through by Firmino but instead dragged a left-foot shot tantalisingly wide while Firmino might have done better with a headed chance.Klopp brought on Georginio Wijnaldum and Thiago Alcântara but although the latter dazzled, Newcastle remained as obdurate as ever with Federico Fernández’s superb tackle to dispossess Salah and Fabian Schär’s last gasp clearance off the line from Mané emblematic of their dogged resistance.Had Alisson not clawed Ciaran Clark’s header to safety, Newcastle might conceivably have stolen a win but a point was sufficient for Bruce to silence the doubters at least temporarily."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3a3f537494851be400e100c62609b300836168e/0_209_6589_3954/master/6589.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58dcc17d21547ed4bcdb48f1d3943a03","title":"wuhan covid china anniversary who coronavirus","story":"As China’s leadership celebrates national triumph over virus, some residents want an investigation into the start of the pandemicJianghan Road in Wuhan throngs with shoppers and strollers bundled up against the late December freeze. Bells ring out on the hour from the landmark Hankou Customs House where the road terminates near the wide banks of the Yangtze River.Restaurants along the city’s main pedestrian thoroughfare are packed, even on an icy weekday night, and resound with loud conversation.The bustle, bright lights and din of the street appear to show a city back to some normality one year on from 31 December 2019, the day that health authorities in the city reported an unknown pneumonia outbreak to World Health Organization (WHO) colleagues in Beijing.But under the surface a struggle continues between residents of the city that was the first to feel the pain of the coronavirus pandemic and authorities over how to remember the initial response to the crisis.“In the coming days I think people will have a bit of fear,” said 22-year old Zhou Xiangning, a Wuhan resident who caught the virus in mid-January. “Not a fear of the virus returning, but fear from the memories of that time,” he said over a steaming bamboo tray of soup filled thin-skinned dumplings.Wuhan and its roughly 11 million residents were abruptly locked down on 23 January after weeks of being told that the virus was controllable, preventable and not contagious. The aim was to limit greater spread of the disease that has since become known as Covid-19, and that has spread around the world and killed almost 2 million people.In Wuhan, many people are still guarded about what they can and cannot say about what happened a year ago and the lessons they learned.In April, after 76 days, Wuhan emerged from lockdown. Aided by thousands of local volunteers who delivered and distributed scarce PPE and food supplies and drove ill people to hospitals by doctors and nurses working until collapse or until the virus overtook them by workers who built temporary hospitals in a matter of days to relieve inundated facilities, Wuhan made it through.The memory the Chinese Communist party wants people to keep, though, is of the larger national effort to control the outbreak. The inrush of medical staff and People’s Liberation Army soldiers from provinces across China and the emergency response from the central government after 23 January get key billing.A three-month exhibition showcasing China’s coronavirus response, nearing its end in Wuhan, captures all this and more. It paints a China triumphant over the virus, with inconvenient narratives left out.But there is no mention of Dr Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist hailed as a whistleblower after being reprimanded by police for warning colleagues about a “Sars-like illness” on 30 December last year, and who later died from Covid. Anything gaining traction on Chinese social media not supporting the correct collective memory is swiftly censored.What still irks some Wuhan residents is the downplaying of the seriousness of the virus in the weeks before the lockdown, when people such as Li were trying to sound the warning.One of those was Zhang Hai, who lost his 76-year old father on 1 February. Zhang believes the death could have been prevented if it was known the virus was contagious in mid-January, before he decided to return to Wuhan from Shenzhen after his father broke a leg.“They want to sell a story that they effectively controlled the virus here, but they also try to wipe out the cause,” Zhang said. “The cause is concealing and covering up the information early on, but they seem to only focus on the results afterwards. That does nothing to wipe the pain out of the hearts of those who lost family members.”Han, still grieving from the loss of her father to the virus in February, does not want her full name used out of fear of retribution by authorities. She also wants the mistakes from that period exposed with a proper investigation.Her father became infected a few days before the lockdown but was not given a test for Covid, so he was not counted in the death toll. Han said authorities could have done more to warn residents.Zhang and Han said they hoped the forthcoming investigation by the WHO into the virus outbreak would also take into account the actions by the local government during the first three weeks of January 2020.WHO officials have said the investigation, which will commence after the team arrives in January 2021 and undergoes a 14-day quarantine, will focus strictly on determining possible zoonotic sources of the virus.The starting point for the WHO team is expected to be the South China Seafood Market, where a large quantity of virus samples were detected after it was closed and sanitised on 1 January 2020.There appears to be little to look at now. Wet snow mixed with a biting wind swirls around the shuttered market. A 8ft-high wall covered in placid scenes of misty mountain tops blocks any view inside the now soundless building.Han hopes that one day the world will know what happened at the start of the outbreak. “Before the pandemic I had faith in the government, but after this it feels like telling the truth is so difficult,” she said. “I hope more people can speak up and tell the truth without fearing someone will come after them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2796d3ae1c11bede84554c1696f405ecaf203a4c/0_0_4128_2477/master/4128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdc27db70d1a95a5c0975816e535df5d","title":"share your experiences of being a uk delivery worker this christmas","story":"We’d like to hear from the people who will be working around the clock to deliver this year’s festive seasonAs the country prepares for a very different kind of Christmas, many people will be shopping online this year instead of hitting the stores in person to stock up on presents and festive treats.We would like to hear from couriers and delivery workers about the year they have had and their work in the run-up to Christmas.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

The government hopes the vaccine, of which it has ordered 100m doses, will transform prospects in the UK and check the spread of the rampaging coronavirus variant which has caused cases to surge. Pharmacies as well as GPs will be able to give the jabs to those at risk.But the MHRA and the government’s advisory Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisation delivered a surprise by announcing approval of a regime that was not trialled. Both the Oxford vaccine and the PfizerBioNTech jab which is already in use will be given to people as one shot, followed by another up to 12 weeks later, in order to extend some protection to as many people as possible as quickly as possible.Boris Johnson said at a Downing Street press conference that the benefits from the vaccine would kick in within 21 days. “What that means is we can vaccinate and protect many more people in the coming weeks,” he said.He hoped that by spring of 2021, many coronavirus restrictions would be able to be lifted. “If we’re right and the vaccination programme does have the positive effects that we think it can have, and I stress these are ifs, then clearly a lot of the non-pharmaceutical interventions … will recede into the past,” he said. “We’ll be able to do things very differently.”The prime minister added that the public may need to carry on with “basic disciplines” such as washing hands and wearing masks “for a while after”.The approval of the vaccine by the MHRA after weeks of examining trial data was greeted with excitement and relief by experts. The PfizerBioNTech vaccine already in use needs to be stored in the long-term at -70C and is hard to deploy. The Oxford vaccine, however, can be kept in a normal fridge at 2-8C and is easily transported from UK factories, meaning it will not have to be kept in central hospital and community hubs, enabling a swift rollout to GP practices and care homes.Amid the widespread praise for Oxford University and AstraZeneca in gaining UK approval for a vaccine that is vital to the global prospects of ending the pandemic because of its low cost and normal refrigeration, some experts were anxious at the proposed mode of use. They said it was pragmatic to try to ensure as many people as possible had a first shot, giving them some protection, but that there were unanswered questions. These include the evidence for extending the time between injections to 12 weeks, which could lead to some people not returning for the second dose.PfizerBioNTech said that their vaccine was not designed to be used in two shots 12 weeks apart. In a statement, the firms said there was no evidence the first shot continued to work beyond three weeks.The decision to approve the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine followed “rigorous clinical trials and a thorough analysis of the data by experts at the MHRA, which has concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness”, the DHSC said.AstraZeneca said its vaccine would be made available to some of the poorest regions of the world at a low cost and was not being manufactured for profit.Talking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said the company could provide the UK with as many as 2m doses a week and would start shipping the first doses “today or tomorrow”.He said: “Vaccination will start next week and we will get to 1m a week, and beyond that a week, very rapidly. The good news with this is we are going to be able to inject a lot of people with one dose very quickly, provide them with a reasonably good dose of protection until they get their second dose two to three months later. That will enable us to protect many more people because we can wait two to three months for the second dose.”Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, said every adult in the UK could eventually be offered vaccination.Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: “Because we’ve got enough of this vaccine on order to vaccinate the whole population – we’ve got 100m doses on order – add that to the 30m doses of Pfizer and that’s enough for two doses for the entire population.“So I can now say with confidence that we can vaccinate everyone, except of course for children because this vaccine has not been trialled on children, and anyway children are much, much less likely to have symptoms from the disease.”Appraisal of the Oxford vaccine has taken longer than it did for the PfizerBioNTech product, which the UK was the first country to approve on 2 December. The dossier of testing and trial results for the Oxford vaccine was more complicated.The MHRA acknowledged there was limited data on the effects of the vaccine in elderly people. Ongoing trials in the UK and US will supply more evidence, but it said it was satisfied the vaccine was safe and effective in the older population.The researchers have pointed out that none of the volunteers in the trials who had the vaccine became seriously ill or were admitted to hospital.Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and the chief investigator of the Oxford trial, said: “The regulator’s assessment that this is a safe and effective vaccine is a landmark moment, and an endorsement of the huge effort from a devoted international team of researchers and our dedicated trial participants.“Though this is just the beginning, we will start to get ahead of the pandemic, protect health and economies when the vulnerable are vaccinated everywhere, as many as possible as soon possible.”The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, tweeted: “We now need a national effort to get vaccinations delivered across the country.”Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, welcomed the news, tweeting: “Now let’s go hell for leather to get jabs rolled out. We’ve seen how more virus circulating means opportunities for variants to emerge. This is now a race against time.

But it was reported that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had personally intervened to ensure Hamilton would be rewarded for his sporting achievements.It was confirmed on Wednesday that Hamilton, who in September also set up a commission to analyse the lack of ersity in motor racing, had been recognised through the “diplomatic and overseas” list rather than the domestic list to avoid controversy over his tax returns.Hamilton was congratulated by Stefano Domenicali, the new CEO of F1, who praised him as a “true giant of our sport”.“His influence is huge both in and out of a car,” he added. “What he has achieved is phenomenal with still more to come. All of us at Formula 1 congratulate him on this well-deserved recognition of his achievements and look forward to seeing more of his brilliance in 2021.”The Exeter director of rugby, Rob Baxter, was awarded an OBE, meanwhile, and the team’s captain, Joe Simmonds, an MBE after the Chiefs won the Premiership title and the European Champions Cup. There were also MBEs for Jimmy Greaves, the former Tottenham and England striker, and the former Wolves midfielder Ron Flowers, who become the last surviving members of England’s 1966 World Cup-winning squad to be honoured.In women’s football Gill Coultard, the first to win 100 senior England football caps, received an MBE – a gong that was also given to Great Britain’s Billie Jean King Cup tennis captain Anne Keothavong.The former Leeds Rhino scrum-half Rob Burrow, who has motor neurone disease, was also granted and MBE in recognition of services to his sport and in raising MND awareness during the coronavirus pandemic. His former teammate, the Leeds director of rugby Kevin Sinfield, ran seven marathons in seven days to raise funds for the MND Association on Burrow’s behalf, with the total now more than £2.5m.Burrow said “2020 has taught us all to appreciate the gifts we have and it is my honour and privilege to accept this award on behalf of all the MND community”, and added: “I hope it gives people hope that we are not ignored and the drive for more research and support to end MND will not stop.”Bob Champion, who won the 1981 Grand National on Aldaniti after recovering from cancer, has been awarded a CBE for his charitable work at the Bob Champion Cancer Trust.Matt Hampson, who was paralysed from the neck down during a training session with the England Under-21 rugby union team in 2005, has been given an OBE for services to charity. Matchroom chairman Barry Hearn was given the same award for services to sport after a 40-year career.

With teeth as white as his it is as easy to fix a grin as not and in pandemic-gripped boxing, there has not been much to smile about.In a Zoom conversation from his home in California, the Golden Boy smiles pretty much from start to finish. He has two items to sell, as it happens: his unbeaten young lightweight, Ryan García, who fights Luke Campbell for the interim WBC lightweight title in Dallas on Saturday, and himself.After declaring García could be a bigger star than he was, De La Hoya confirms he wants to box again, perhaps against Gennady Golovkin. Before GGG’s successful extension of his own career this month, he all but threatened to kill De La Hoya if they shared a ring. They have history. This, surely, was not a good career move for someone who turns 48 in February and has not fought in 12 years.He generated $700m as a fighter and it is said he has hung on to more than $200m of it. So money should not be an issue. “It is a serious proposition. The main reason is because I love it and I miss it,” he says, beaming like a man given the choice of reliving his past or listening to Barry Manilow for the rest of his life.A Golovkin fight is wildly optimistic. Even at 38, he is formidable enough coming off an excellent win over the younger, unbeaten Kamil Szeremeta to stay in the mix for a third fight with boxing’s pound-for-pound best, Saul ‘Canelo’ Álvarez – whom De La Hoya promoted until they split this year.Except that is only true in the imagination. What De La Hoya is contemplating is public self-destruction to scratch an itch – which is why he came out of retirement to fight Manny Pacquiao in 2008 and got his butt kicked for the seven rounds it lasted.De La Hoya is inspired by Mike Tyson’s exhibition “draw” against Roy Jones Jr a month ago, 15 years after Kevin McBride finished his real career. “What Mike Tyson did was very inspirational,” he says. “He looked great. He looked like the old Mike Tyson, against a fighter who at one point was the best on the planet.”The screaming caveat is “at one point was”. De La Hoya concedes Tyson’s reflexes “were a little off” but adds: “If you give your body, your mind, your soul enough time to prepare for a fight you can do it – if you’re injury-free.”Oscar’s world is full of ifs. But he draws strength from another legend who briefly did come back, albeit in better circumstances. Before Sugar Ray Leonard beat Marvin Hagler in 1987, he spent 12 months having real fights behind closed doors, with 10oz gloves and no headgear to simulate the feel of combat again.In a 16-year career that persuaded The Ring magazine to rate him the 14th of all time, De La Hoya outclassed the best of his era: César Chávez (twice), Pernell Whitaker, Héctor Camacho, Ike Quartey, Rafael Ruelas and Genaro Hernández among many others. Only the best beat him: Felix Trinidad, Shane Mosley (twice), Bernard Hopkins, Floyd Mayweather Jr and Pacquiao. In victory and defeat, age played a part. It always does.Back in the real world, he sees the striking similarities between himself and García, a Californian Mexican with flashing fists, good looks and an astonishing fanbase. “He’s a very confident young kid with a lot of abilities. I strongly feel Ryan García is probably the hardest worker in boxing today. He loves what he does. He knows what he wants – and I believe he’s gonna be successful at it.”“Everybody is talking about how special he’s gonna be and how special he is. I’m thinking as a fighter now, if I were in his position, I would feel a little nervous, maybe a little: ‘Wow, am I going to live up to this expectation? It makes me work harder, it makes me focus more on what I want to accomplish over the years.’ That pressure is going to lead him to become great. He’s a big 135-pounder. I believe he can get up to 154 … maybe 160?”De La Hoya, as promoter, is bound to acknowledge Campbell will be a worthy challenger, given the 33-year-old Yorkshireman has mixed at a much higher level as a professional over a far longer time and comes to the contest bursting with confidence.“Luke Campbell is a very, very dangerous fighter for anyone. He has an Olympic gold medal, he’s very dedicated, devoted to his craft. Luke Campbell is the same height as Ryan García. He’s a southpaw, he’s gonna present some problems. It’s not gonna be easy. Ryan has to be on his A-game.”De La Hoya’s smile illuminates our Zoom farewell and I’m left wondering if it is still there after he clicks the “leave” button, a blunt metaphor for his boxing life. Perhaps the oldest Golden Boy in town is gambling he has nothing to lose but his teeth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff948b3b7457b5516f60e752af2db947c9f990ed/0_290_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=53803cbc35d2140d5b5bdde4b9610870","title":"from buying a bike to baking the best cakes local retailers reveal what every shopper should know","story":"Whether it’s tips on cleaning vinyl, or how to keep your plants alive while you’re on holiday, the friendly faces behind independent retailers across the country can offer you expertise that is hard to come by anywhere elseThere’s a particular magic that can happen when we shop on our local high streets. Transactions become interactions and purchases can feel like lucky finds. Much of this is due to the genuine passion and know-how of local shopkeepers.Earlier this year, Visa introduced readers to a virtual high street, featuring inspirational local shopkeepers who had been forced to rethink their businesses almost overnight in response to lockdown. We learned how each of them met the challenges of continuing to operate in a world where face-to-face shopping had almost ground to a halt.Thanks to their determination, and that of thousands of local shopkeepers up and down the country, consumers have been able to rediscover the magic of buying from local merchants, benefitting from their handy know-how and advice. So, to celebrate their wealth of expertise, here are some top tips from the shopkeepers we introduced you to earlier this year.Successful baking: it’s all about weights and measuresPaul Rawlinson, owner of Baltzersen’s cafe and bakery in Harrogate“The biggest mistake we see home bakers making is weighing ingredients inaccurately, so invest in a pair of digital scales. You can buy expensive ones or pick up very cost-effective options in lots of places. Weigh everything: dry ingredients, fats and liquids. It’s a well-used line that cooking is an art and baking is a science – and taking these measurements is a reason why.”Cycling to work: protect your bike, protect yourselfWinston Farquharson, owner of SE20 Cycles, Penge, London“If you’re planning to commute by bike for the first time, you’ll need a pump, inner tube and puncture repair kit. Second, get at least two good locks: one to secure, the other as a deterrent. One lock is not seen as a problem but two or more requires more time from the would-be thief, which in turn means more of a chance of being detected. Finally, a helmet. So, so, so useful. It’s not until you’ve had an accident with a helmet that you realise that broken piece of helmet could so easily have been a part of your head.”Switching to zero waste: go one room at a timeStephanie Foulds, co-owner with husband Matthew of The Eco Larder zero waste store and yoga studio, Edinburgh“Switching to zero waste shopping can be overwhelming at first. What we have found helpful on our own journeys is to start with one room at a time. Beginning with your bathroom, for example, breaks it down to just a few products such as soap, shampoo, conditioner and toothpaste. Before you know it, you are refilling those items and you are on your way.”Caring for vinyl: clean and storeSteve Courtnell, owner of Pie \u0026amp Vinyl, Southsea“The secret to ensuring that vinyl stays clean and in top-notch condition is to keep the record sleeve in plastic. A good carbon fibre brush and record cleaner are always useful. When you put the record on the platter, let it rotate and have a look for any dust – give it a quick brush by holding the brush in one place and letting the record rotate. Do this after a listen also. Always put them back in their disco sleeve and then back in the cover. Store it in a dry space – we’ll get on to alphabetising later!”Getting creative: limitations can helpBarry Whitehouse, owner of The Artery art shop, Banbury“Many people get the urge to do something arty and as soon as they grab their brush or pencil nothing happens. Many hit this stumbling block straight away and then give up. Try keeping a sketchbook handy. Sketchbooks can come as small as a postcard in size so it is a great way for on-the-spot urges of creativity as it easily fits in a pocket or handbag. Limit the amount of time you take. Challenge yourself to do a drawing or painting in only 10 minutes. And give yourself a theme. It could be anything – chairs, shoes. Draw the ones in your home, your place of work or from photographs.”Shopping sustainably: ask about the supply chainKaela Mills, owner of Sprout ethical childrenswear shop, BexhillThen there are the people involved. Their ethical treatment, pay and safety are paramount and ethical retailers should be able to provide information about this quickly and transparently.”Threading a needle: get the right toolMaria Sammur, owner of Really Maria craft shop in East Dulwich, London, and online“One of my best sellers is a needle threader. It’s so easy to use and saves time. Another top seller is a seam ripper, which really is a sewer’s best friend.”Caring for plants: water while you’re awaySiân Wild, owner of The Flower Lounge, Didsbury, Manchester“To help your house plants thrive if you go away, try a watering globe. You can easily make your own version. Start with a clean and empty plastic bottle. For a small to medium container, a water bottle will work just fine. Drill several drainage holes into the bottle close to the top.Before you head on holiday, water your plant as normal. Fill the plastic bottle with water, and then quickly turn it over and plunge it into the first few inches of soil in the pot. Make sure the bottle is not too close to your plant and that the bottle is deep enough that the soil covers the holes. The water will slowly leak out of the bottle as the soil dries out.”Finding what you’re after: talk to staff Andrea Mahoney, owner of CoLab gift shop, Bristol“Talk to your local independent retailers. Here at CoLab, we support our local Bristol artists and makers. I listen to my customers and work directly with my suppliers to find the products they love. Running a shop of your own, you need to be fully invested in what you’re selling.”Choosing soft furnishings: be bold Karen Harvey, owner of Scandi-Scottish design boutique Hoos, Glasgow“The joy of adding textiles to your room is that it gives you the opportunity to be bold and take more risks than you would with more permanent pieces such as a sofa. Pick out a colour you love from a poster or painting on your wall and bring that into your room – if it’s a vivid yellow or orange, it will really bring a fun vibe into your interior. It’s not about matching or clashing but choosing to blend colour and texture into your space.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/846_671_5154_3093/master/5154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aec1f05050616f960bb1049e30f52d83","title":"we recommend things we love independent retailers on why shopping local is best","story":"From providing service with a friendly touch to stocking gems you can’t find anywhere else, local shopkeepers are vital to our communities – and the benefits go both waysYou could call it an extra level of customer care. Simon Broadribb, owner of the Uptons of Bassett butchers in Southampton, has a habit of bowing to those who visit his shop. “Some of the other butchers take the mickey out of me because I bow, but I want the customer to feel that we’re grateful,” he says. “Anyone can go to the supermarket and buy meat in there, so for them to spend their money with us is an honour.”Broadribb is not alone in feeling immense gratitude towards his customers, particularly after what has been such a difficult year for small independent retailers. Siân Wild, owner of The Flower Lounge in Didsbury, Manchester, feels much the same: “We’re so lucky that our residents have a strong sense of community and love to support local businesses, as it has been vital to us surviving this pandemic.”It ought to go without saying that this gratitude should run both ways – extending from us to the local shopkeepers who have gone above and beyond for us this year. To celebrate this special bond, we asked some shopkeepers about the meaningful relationships they have forged with their customers and their communities.The customer communitySarah Atkinson of Bunny’s Moggy’s Doggy’s Pet Supplies in Chorley, Lancashire, describes regular customers as part of an extended family that has long been looking out for each other. “We are a little community,” she says. “We watch their children and pets grow up and they us. We are very much a family unit.”Similarly, Rachael Johnson of vintage emporium The Yesterday Society in Newcastle says: “My customers mean the world to me and I now have great friendships with several of them.” This allows her to provide a level of personal service that would not otherwise be possible: “I have been known to contact my regulars if I get something that I think they will love or know they have been looking for.”Karen Harvey of Scottish Scandi homeware boutique Hoos in Glasgow, emphasises the importance of physical presence. “What’s really different about local shops is that the owner of the business is often present, and customers get to build a relationship with them,” she says. “At Hoos, it’s like a village store. You say: ‘How are you? How’s your grandchild?’ You get to admire the new baby when you’ve seen the mum come in while she’s pregnant.”This personal element is something many local retailers strive to maintain even as they’ve had to reorient their businesses this year. Despite having to pivot into e-commerce during the pandemic, Wild is dedicated to ensuring The Flower Lounge still provides customers “the personal touch that comes from buying locally – the feeling of purchasing something unique and handmade just for them”.The commercial communityCommercial success ripples out across the community as well. “We buy our bread from six miles down the road,” says Broadribb of his butchers. “We sell over 100 loaves per week, which supports Jim the baker. We also sell jam from a lady nearby and two local beers.”Atkinson points out that local shopkeepers are also the customers of other local businesses: “It’s so important to support local independent traders because your money is put back into the local economy – buying from us means we can shop and support local businesses. We source as many of our products as locally and independently as we can.”Paul Rawlinson of Baltzersen’s bakery in Harrogate agrees. “The unseen benefits of shopping local are that smaller businesses tend to support one another and the community through their supply chain, use of local tradespeople, engage with professional services and get involved with charities,” he says. “Shopping local keeps families in their homes and their businesses on the streets of our towns and cities where they belong.”A poignant reminder of these community connections was shared by Sean Cooper, boss of Weyfish, a harbourside fishmongers in Weymouth, Dorset. “We have 32 fishing boats that we buy from. Some of those don’t land every day, but around half of them do,” he says. “Come rain or shine, they’re out there.”“In a week when two fishermen were lost off the south coast, it’s a sobering reminder of what a dangerous profession it is,” he says. “Yes, we make a profit on what we buy from them. But we also make a contribution to the entire fishing community of Weymouth. That support makes a difference to so many families.”Connecting the two communitiesBy championing local suppliers, independent retailers effectively build bridges between business communities and customer communities. “We get to recommend the things we genuinely love, and in turn pass that knowledge to a customer to enjoy,” says Steve Courtnell of Pie and Vinyl in Southsea. “When discovering a new act or album, we can hopefully bring them the very same joy we felt.” Indeed, it’s that combination of passion and expertise that can make shopping local so magical."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb047ac9aae98a9b5f79f8535ed3bad45bf3a150/0_201_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6cbacc7d05d56b850fadddd0bdc1751","title":"close to home 10 tips to make shopping locally part of your daily routine in the new year","story":"Supporting our local businesses is now more important than ever, for shopkeepers and customers alike. Here are some ideas to help you maintain the good habit We all hope that 2021 will be a much happier year. But we might also seek to safeguard some of the good things that we’ve discovered in 2020. For instance, we’ve rediscovered our neighbourhoods and our community spirit. And many of us have re-evaluated what’s really important in life.We’ve also shifted our shopping habits to support local and independent businesses – partly because lockdown restrictions have forced us to shop closer to home. In doing so, we’ve rediscovered many benefits of shopping locally – from forging human bonds with our shopkeepers to reducing our carbon footprints and finding everyday hidden gems. And if our interactions have become more meaningful to us, we’ve also come to appreciate just how much they mean to our local shopkeepers.So here are 10 new year resolutions to help you maintain the good habit of shopping locally next year.1. Save your favourite local shops to your home screenMany of your local shops will have stepped up their online shopping presence this year as lockdown restrictions forced them to rejig their business models. While we’re all used to downloading apps on our smartphones for big shopping chains, doing so can mean we overlook our local shops. Saving your favourite local shop’s website to your smartphone or tablet’s home screen will help bring them to your attention the next time you’re scrolling or swiping.2. Join community groupsWhether you volunteer with your local branch of Mutual Aid, pick up your local newspaper, or simply join a group on social media, being part of your community will help you get to know your local shops and businesses. Joining a group is a great way of being the first to find out about new openings, products and loyalty schemes.3. Make local shopping part of your routineWhether it’s popping to the local bakery for a sausage sandwich on a Saturday morning, or taking the kids to the toy store to pick up a small weekly treat, weaving local shopping trips into your day will help it become second nature. Try to add a local shopping trip to new routines, too. Have you swapped your commute for a daily walk? Then think about picking up a coffee or pastry along the way.4. Make it part of your budgetShopping on the local high street can sometimes be a little more expensive than hitting a big supermarket or shopping centre, so it’s a good idea to make it part of your budget. Set aside a bit of extra money each month to cover purchases you wouldn’t normally consider buying locally, and help give those businesses you’ve become familiar with an even bigger boost. You’re investing in your own neighbourhood, after all.5. Show your loyaltyAt a time when so many local shops are struggling, businesses are developing ingenious new ways of enticing regular customers. Some ideas, such as loyalty cards and coffee subscription services, are inspired by larger stores and offer you an even bigger incentive to shop local. Others, such as one local bookshop’s creative #BuyAStrangerABook day, add to the many reasons shopping on the high street can give you a feeling like no other – so make sure you get involved.6. Share the love onlineMake sure you spread the word about those businesses that have found a special place in your heart and wallet. Post a photo of that maple-glazed doughnut on your social media, let your friends know about the toy store that puts on free puppet shows, and add positive ratings to review sites.7. Do some researchUnless you’re looking out for a specific shop, some of the options on your local high street can easily pass you by. If there are stores you’ve never browsed before, now’s the time to pop in and find out exactly what they stock so you’re armed with that information when you next need to buy something. Have a look online, too, to see which local businesses offer delivery. As well as being convenient, you’ll be in a good position to help support local shops from home in the event of another lockdown.8. Be a familiar faceShopping on the high street is a great way to become more integrated and involved with your local community, and becoming a familiar face can help you shop smarter, too. Take the time to get to know the owners in your favourite stores, and you’ll enjoy all the perks that come with being a valued regular, from being the first to hear about new products and discounts, to the chance to pause your shopping for a chat.9. No purchase is too small As society becomes increasingly digital, some of us might be less likely to make those small, impulse purchases with the spare coins we find in our pockets. Whether it’s a nice coffee made by a barista or an extra treat such as a brownie or a slice of cake, these are the smaller purchases you might no longer consider. But remember that no amount is too small to put on your card. And you can tap to pay contactlessly with your mobile phone too, so don’t forgo those spare-change moments just because you don’t have any change.10. Be open-mindedOne of the good things about shopping locally is the fact that businesses know their products inside-out, so don’t be afraid to ask them questions and seek their advice. If you shop with an open mind, you’re more likely to uncover new things you’ll love along the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/740b25da7bc47b480325a91111e98257c779d099/173_549_2973_1783/master/2973.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec7c6a96bdb831be3e935bbffe76735c","title":"britons urged to stay home on new years eve as covid cases soar","story":"Scientists say virus rampant in UK and advise people to avoid meeting up with family and friendsScientists, police and the prime minister are urging people to welcome in the new year in their own home, with an NHS chief warning it is “absolutely vital” to avoid meeting family and friends because “Covid loves a crowd”.Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, told Wednesday’s No 10 press conference that the new UK coronavirus variant was fuelling a steep rise in infections, and said any plans to meet with those from other households should be postponed.“Its absolutely vital that this year everybody continues to follow the guidance by staying at home and not mixing,” he said. “Covid loves a crowd so please leave the parties for later in the year.”The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also instructed people to follow local restrictions and see in the new year at home.“That means not meeting up with friends or family indoors, unless they are in the same household or support bubble, and avoiding large gatherings of any kind,” he said.Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, told the briefing: “I know new year is coming up, I know it is normally a time of great festivity and enjoyment, but you have just got to play your part now in bringing us back from this very dangerous situation that we find ourselves in.”The UK reported another 981 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, the highest daily toll since April, and a further 50,023 infections in the last 24 hours. The number of patients in hospital with Covid in England is higher than recorded during the peak of the first wave. Prof Peter Openshaw of Imperial College London, a member of the UK’s Sage scientific advisory sub-group Nervtag, said the situation was very worrying.He added that the impact of Christmas mixing was expected to become apparent in case numbers and the death toll in the coming weeks.Prof Kamlesh Khunti, of the University of Leicester, who sits on Sage and is also a member of the Independent Sage group of experts, said the virus was rampant and the situation severe.Khunti added that no one should be complacent, noting Covid had also affected young people, and urged people to forgo meeting up in person to welcome in 2021.“Please do not go out and celebrate,” he said. “Some people have managed really well having celebrations virtually. There is a way to do this,” he added, noting that technology meant people could chat, drink and socialise together safely.“We have got now the vaccine, we shouldn’t really mess this up now,” he said.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, urged Scots to avoid traditional celebrations for Hogmanay on Thursday, including “first footing” neighbours and relatives on New Year’s Day and holding house parties to welcome the new year. “We should bring in the 2021 in our own homes, with our own households,” she told MSPs. “This new strain is very serious.

Local authorities in Essex also sent a plea for military help to increase hospital capacity, with fears over critical care and bed capacity, staff sickness and the ability to discharge patients quickly into safe environments.Health chiefs said non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments were being delayed, but serious operations, including for cancer, would go ahead.Tett said: “Whilst today’s announcement about the approval of the Oxford vaccine is excellent news, we still need to deal with the deteriorating situation we face immediately across the county.“We believe that this rapid increase is due to the spread of the new, more transmissible Covid variant across much of the south-east, particularly prior to the introduction of the tier 4 regulations.”It comes after Essex Resilience Forum (ERF) said the number of patients receiving treatment for coronavirus had exceeded the peak of the first wave, and figures were expected to increase.The Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin requested armed forces assistance for Essex in the Commons on Wednesday, including for vaccine deployment and testing in schools.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said pressures in Essex were “very significant” and he would “look favourably on the county’s request for military assistance”, working with the defence secretary, Ben Wallace.Anthony McKeever, the executive lead for Mid and South Essex Health and Care Partnership, said: “We are taking every action possible within the NHS and across the wider health and social care partnerships in Essex to limit the impact on the NHS and the wider health system.“This involves using critical care capacity elsewhere in Essex and the eastern region and identifying additional locations and capacity to assist with the discharging of patients to reduce pressure on hospitals.”The two counties are under the highest tier 4 restrictions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfc9fcff3b821810e1fc0a3c5bfccc719a5d9080/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1abe31f9ae9bd175f94c1fe63605d30c","title":"egypt drops inquiry into of italian student giulio regeni","story":"Prosecutors reject Italy’s finding that Egyptian security officials were behind kidnap and tortureEgypt’s public prosecution has officially closed its investigation into the murder of Giulio Regeni, rejecting Italian prosecutors’ findings that accused four Egyptian security officials of kidnapping and torturing the Italian doctoral student in 2016.Italy officially indicted four Egyptian security officials including two from Egypt’s national security agency in early December. The four men were accused of kidnapping Regeni, whose body was found on an outlying Cairo highway in February 2016 showing signs of torture. One of the suspects, named as Magdi Ibrahim Abdel Al Sharif, is accused of grievous bodily harm.Italian prosecutors gave the four men 20 days to respond to the charges. On the day of the deadline, Egypt’s public prosecution officially closed its own investigation, after suspending it when Rome prosecutors released their findings.Regeni’s murder rocked Italian-Egyptian diplomatic relations, leading to the brief recall of the Italian ambassador to Cairo and driving calls to suspend the country’s arms sales to Egypt. Investigators in Rome previously said Regeni had been entrapped “in a spider’s web” spun by Egyptian security agents.Tensions are expected to flare again with a trial of the four security officials in 2021, predicted to take place in absentia. “The Egyptian authorities’ lack of response to our requests has impeded our inquiry,” said the lead prosecutor, Michele Prestipino, when Rome closed its own investigation.In a long and rambling statement on Wednesday, Egyptian prosecutors hit back at their Italian counterparts’ findings as well as their five-year-long investigation into Regeni’s murder.The Italian investigators’ findings were the result of “wrong conclusions”, they said, arguing that Rome’s accusations lacked evidence. They claimed Regeni’s murder was the result of unknown “enemy parties” seeking to drive a wedge between Italian-Egyptian relations, as evidenced by the discovery of Regeni’s body close to security institutions run by the national security agency on a day when an Italian delegation was visiting Egypt.The statement also accused Regeni’s parents of removing evidence such as their son’s laptop from his Cairo apartment before Egyptian investigators could examine it, and claimed the UK and Kenya had ignored Egypt’s requests for details of key witness testimony provided to the Italians.One of three key witnesses cited by Rome prosecutors, known as Gamma, reportedly told investigators that Abdel Al Sharif had been overheard at a security conference in Nairobi telling another officer: “We kidnapped Regeni. We thought he was a British spy.”Other witnesses told Italian investigators they had seen Regeni in a Cairo police station and in Lazoghly, a large security facility run by the national security agency associated with enforced disappearances and torture.As they closed their own investigation, Egyptian prosecutors attempted to frame Regeni’s behaviour patterns, research on Egyptian trade unions, sources of academic funding and activities as suspicious, but provided no information about who was ultimately responsible for his death.“The victim’s behaviour and unusual movements were not hidden,” they said, citing details of his previous journeys to Turkey and Israel, nations often viewed as enemies within the Egyptian security establishment.“Despite this unusual behaviour an investigation confirmed that his deeds did not pose threats to national security,” they added.Regeni’s parents criticised Egypt’s handling of the case in early December. “In these five years, we have been overcome with indignation by the countless injustices on the part of the Egyptian authorities,” they said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16288082b20f7e938f9b9441b8af1b43ca84f2e1/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0e50bd9d621d7a66f5218eccedd12efe","title":"see your own back yard just dont poo in it new zealanders told","story":"Local travel making up for lack of overseas visitors but also causing problems The head of New Zealand’s department of conservation (DOC) has called on Kiwis to show greater respect for their environment amid a boom in domestic tourism that has been accompanied by reports of littering, human waste and wildlife disturbance.Restrictions on international travel due to Covid-19 have forced New Zealanders to holiday at home, with government data showing some holiday spots are busier than they were before the pandemic despite the absence of tourists from overseas.With New Zealand’s border closed to nearly all foreign arrivals since April, sites and attractions typically popular with first-time visitors such as Franz Josef Glacier and Milford Sound have recorded a huge decline in visitors, Radio New Zealand reports.But regions with driving distance of major cities – including Northland, Coromandel and the top of the South Island – have seen high growth as New Zealanders responded to the government’s call to support the struggling tourism industry and “see your own back yard”.The top of the South Island was shaping up to be especially busy, with the Abel Tasman coastal track recording more than double the bookings of any other Great Walk, and Tōtaranui proving the country’s most popular campsite. More than 42,000 bednights had been booked from early December to the end of February.But the DOC director general, Lou Sanson, expressed disappointment that the buoyancy in visitor numbers had been accompanied by reports of littering, human waste and wildlife being disturbed. He said he had hoped that New Zealand holidaymakers would show greater respect for their local environment.“Sadly we’re still seeing people doing things that put our unique species at significant risk, such as feeding kea and disturbing seals, dolphins and penguins,” Sanson told RNZ.The tourism minister, Stuart Nash, has said he intends to ban the lease or hiring of vans without toilet facilities to international visitors, in a bid to combat waste.“If the driver or the passenger wants to go to the toilet – we all know examples of this – they pull over to the road and they shit in our waterways,” he explained on RNZ’s Morning Report program last month.“If you’re willing to pay for a campervan at least you have the ability to dispose of your excrement in a way that meets our sustainability goals and, quite frankly, our brand.”Once borders reopened New Zealand would “unashamedly” target the super-wealthy from overseas ahead of freedom campers and backpackers, Nash said – prompting complaints that he was over-simplifying at the expense of younger and lower-income visitors.Freedom camping, and unedifying waste disposal, is also not strictly the purview of foreigners.This year the government invested $8m in the Responsible Camping Project, which supports councils to offer infrastructure and educational resources for people wanting to camp in their area.Queenstown Lakes district council has hired eight “freedom camping ambassadors” to inform visitors to the area of the rules and facilities. Craig Gallagher, council spokesman, told RNZ that the uptick in first-time freedom campers from other parts in New Zealand would need to be managed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447635.1609357222!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools welcome decision to close until january 11th","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Schools had been due to reopen on January 6th, but the decision to delay was made at a hastily convened Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Photograph: iStockThe Cabinet has agreed to keep schools closed until January 11th following record numbers of Covid-19 cases in recent days and calls from unions and parents’ groups not to play “Russian roulette” with children’s health.Schools had been due to reopen on January 6th, but the decision to delay was made at a hastily convened Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. It comes following an increase in the number of cases of Covid-19, the highest number of hospitalisations since May, and a massive rise in referrals of suspected cases in the past week.The delay had been called for by John Boyle, general secretary of the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO), in a letter to Minister for Education Norma Foley on Tuesday.The organisation representing primary schools said January 11th should be the earliest date for children to begin the new term. Mr Boyle said this should be considered “on public health grounds in the interest of securing safer schools for pupils, staff and their families”.In a short statement on Wednesday, following the announcement by Government that schools would remain closed, Mr Boyle welcomed the move.“We welcome the swift movement by Government to delay the reopening of our primary and special schools,” he said.“As we set out yesterday, the alarming public health data and concerns expressed in respect of the new Covid-19 variation warrant this approach.“We will seek to work constructively with the Department of Education and Nphet to ensure our schools reopen next month and have the necessary supports and protection to stay open safely.”Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (ASTI) general secretary Kieran Christie said the decision by the Government to delay re-opening schools was the correct one.Mr Christie maintained the new variant of the virus, which is much more infectious than previous variations, meant that the situation had changed.“Today’s announcement that schools will re-open on January 11th presents a new window of opportunity for a comprehensive review of the existing school safety arrangements and mitigations that are in place,” he said.“Serious consideration must be given to whether these are now sufficient given the emergence of the new strain of coronavirus.”Mr Christie said they wanted the relative level of safety in schools that existed between September and Christmas to be restored and that the extended holidays should be used to put measures in place to ensure such a safe reopening.Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) general secretary Michael Gillespie said that the delay in re-opening must be used to ensure that schools are as safe as possible for students and staff.He said the spike in cases is causing “grave concern and anxiety”.He echoed the calls of the ASTI that the additional time be used to investigate what additional safety measures and enhancements may be required in schools.“We have said at all times that we will be guided by the advice of the public health authorities and we trust that there will be full consultation and engagement with the Department of Education and Nphet in relation to issues of concern in the coming days,” he said.The latest report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, published on Wednesday, shows there were 21 clusters of Covid-19 detected among school children or staff during the week ending December 31st. That figure represented a reduction of four on the week before.Schools closed for Christmas holidays on December 22nd, and the report pointed out that transmission of Covid-19 within the school setting had not necessarily been established in these outbreaks.Before the announcement to delay re-opening was made, the National Parents Association, which represents more than 40 per cent of students and families in secondary schools, said it would be “reckless to say the least, if not unconscionable” to reopen schools.“Parents have been asked several times this year to play Russian roulette with their children’s health and the guilt and anguish felt by parents whose children have caught this virus in school is something no other parent should have to endure,” it said.“As the light begins to appear at the end of the tunnel let us not put at risk another boy or girl’s life. While we appreciate the priority to keep schools open this lockdown if handled properly will be our last one.”A spokesman for the Federation of Early Childhood Providers has said it is seeking clarity from the Government about whether or not its facilities will be closed for the next month.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Every 0.1 degree matters as the world attempts to keep within 1.5-degree rise\u0026lsquo2020 is on course to be the 10th consecutive year of above-normal temperatures\u0026rsquoOver half of Irish people aiming to live more sustainably in 2021, says survey"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447543.1609344746!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland s climate a year of extremes from wettest february to driest spring","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhotographs taken from drones showing the extent of widespread flooding in the Shannon river catchment during February 2020, due to 252 per cent of normal rainfall. Photomontage: Paul Scott Graphics StudioAny notion Ireland in 2020 escaped the effects of global heating that is triggering more extreme weather events does not tally with Met Éireann’s data for the year.Looking at those figures, and trends over many years, the fate of Ireland in terms of facing into more variable weather patterns with potential for extremes could not be clearer, according to Met Éireann’s senior climatologist Keith Lambkin.His verdict on the year is emphatic: “In Ireland, 2020 is on course to be the 10th consecutive year of above-normal temperatures. A record-breaking wet February and dry spring in places led to flooding followed by a national hosepipe ban. These are extremes that we expect to see more of as our climate continues to change.”There are enough standout figures to indicate there are no grounds for complacency in relation to extreme weather, though “there might not have been as much damage as other years – and thankfully no deaths”, he says.For starters, Lambkin points to 2.5 times more rainfall in February – 16 of 25 monitoring stations recorded their wettest February ever – and records being broken during “a very unseasonal Storm Ellen” in August. What’s more, 19 of the 20 years of this century have had an above-normal temperature.The picture globally is more obvious in terms of extremes. 2020 has been marked by a record hurricane season in the Atlantic wildfires across the planet, from Siberia to the Americas to Australia accelerating melting ice sheets in polar regions and record temperatures in a great many pockets of the planet.In contrast, Ireland is in a “longer burner” scenario, as he describes it. We have variable weather normally, which will continue, Lambkin adds, but with potential for more extreme events, where roofs may come off stadiums and flood defence walls are broken.So while there may be a perception that 2020 was a relatively benign year, the picture from the perspective of a climatologist looking at trends over a longer period is “very consistent”.DroughtsThat means wetter winters and drier springs including droughts than we have been used to. So rainfall will increase by some 10 per cent, but how that manifests itself will be the critical factor. A complex interaction of rain, winds and tides will often combine, resulting in extreme weather events that will be increasingly evident.In the case of February, it was the amount of rain that fell which was the standout feature. That was quickly followed an extended drying period. “So 2020 is a great example of that trend,” Lambkin explains.Huge variation this year was typified in the switch from record rainfall to parts of the east having their driest spring on record. Countrywide, only 58 per cent of normal rainfall fell in March, April and May. During August, sustained wind and gust records were broken during Storm Ellen.As 2020 draws to a close, the world has experienced the warmest decade on record and one of the three hottest years ever measured, according to the World Meteorological Organization.This is in spite of a La Niña event, Lambkin says – when natural weather patterns cool global temperatures. This is expected to peak in intensity in coming weeks and continue through the early part of next year.Record warm years usually coincide with a strong El Niño event – when surface water in the equatorial Pacific becomes warmer than average and east winds blow weaker than normal, as was the case in 2016.We are now experiencing a La Niña, which has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but has not been sufficient to put a brake on this year’s heat, Lambkin confirms.And despite Covid-19 lockdown, global concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to rise. “The science is complex, but the message is clear: to reduce the extremes, we must reduce the warming,” he adds. “The warming we see globally is also observed here in Ireland and it is this warming that increases the risk of more extreme weather events.”Of most concern, this warming is “on an accelerating path, and there is no real slowing the trend downwards”.The global pictureA report by Christian Aid shows extreme weather events occurred in all continents during 2020, many of which caused death and widespread economic damage.The report – Counting the cost 2020: a year of climate breakdown – details the most destructive climate disasters of the year.Ten of those events cost $1.5 billion or more, with nine of them causing damage worth at least $5 billion. Most of these estimates are based only on insured losses, meaning the true financial costs are likely to be higher.Among them is Storm Ciara, which struck Ireland, the UK and other European countries in February, costing $2.7 billion and killing 14 people.While the report focuses on financial costs, which are usually higher in richer countries because they have more valuable property, some extreme weather events were devastating in poorer countries, though the price tag was lower. South Sudan experienced one of its worst floods on record, which killed 138 people and destroyed the year’s crops.Some of the disasters hit fast, such as Cyclone Amphan, which struck the Bay of Bengal in May, fuelled by record warm temperatures in nearby seas, and caused losses valued at $13 billion in just a few days. Other events unfolded over months, such as floods in China and India, costing an estimated $32 billion and $10 billion respectively.Six of the 10 most costly events took place in Asia, five of them associated with an unusually rainy monsoon. And in Africa, huge locust swarms ravaged crops and vegetation across several countries, causing damage estimated at $8.5 billion. The outbreak has been linked to wet conditions brought about by unusual rains fuelled by climate change.Hurricane seasonIn Europe, two extra-tropical cyclones, Ciara and Alex, had a combined cost of almost $6 billion (€4.88 billion), while the US suffered from both a record-breaking hurricane season and a record-breaking fire season adding up to more than $60 billion (€48.82 billion) in damage.Some less-populated places also suffered the consequences of a warming world. In Siberia, a heatwave during the first half of the year set a record in the city of Verkhoyansk, with temperatures reaching 38 degrees.Heat and drought drove the fires in Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. While there were no human casualties reported from these events, it had a terrible impact on bioersity and the planet’s capacity to respond to a warmer world.While climate disruption may have influenced these events, many of the countries that bear little responsibility for global warming were affected, the report underlines.“Whether it be floods in Asia, locusts in Africa or storms in Europe and the Americas, climate change has continued to rage in 2020,” said report author Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aid’s climate policy lead. “It is vital that 2021 ushers in a new era of activity to turn this tide. With president-elect Biden in the White House, social movements across the world calling for urgent action, post-Covid green recovery investment and a crucial UN climate summit hosted by the UK, there is a major opportunity for countries to put us on a path to a safe future.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447677.1609366229!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"level 5 restrictions to remain in place until january 31st says taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin announces new restrictions being imposed to contrain the spread of Covid-19.

From January 3rd, up to six guests are permitted.Universities are being asked to continue operating primarily online, while creches will remain open “with protective measures”.Preschools or early learning services will resume from January 4th.The Department of Housing has confirmed that a moratorium on evictions will be reintroduced from midnight until February 10th due to the curbs on travel.Sports matches and events are banned, except for elite levels. Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools will close and golf and tennis should not take place. Exercise or dance classes will not be allowed.The ban on flights and ferries coming from Britain into the Republic will be extended until January 6th, while travel from South Africa will also be prohibited.The travel ban had been put in place over fears of a new Covid-19 variant identified in southeast England, and was previously extended until December 31st.The new variant, which is believed to be significantly more transmissible, has since been detected in the Republic.New arrangements would be put in place after that date, and “limited repatriation” of Irish residents left stranded in Britain would continue in the meantime, the source said.A different mutant variant of Covid-19 is prevalent in South Africa.‘Deteriorate’In his address to nation, Mr Martin said the new UK strain of Covid-19 was here and the virus was spreading at a rate faster than even the most pessimistic modelling, putting the health service under strain. On Tuesday, 18 per cent of positive cases were this strain.We are already seeing a sharp rise in hospitalisations, he said, almost doubling in one week. The R number is now between 1.6 and 1.8.“The numbers will deteriorate further over the coming days,” he said, and that we will “do what we need to do” to suppress it.This now includes “full scale Level 5 restrictions for at least one month”.He said we now have safe and effective vaccines and factories working around the clock to produce them.“For the first time since this awful disease\u0026nbsplanded on our shores we truly have an end in sight.“The virus can still do immense damage until we have progressed much much further with the vaccination programme.”Until then, we have to continue protecting the vulnerable, he added.“Right now this is what we must do. We must stay at home and eliminate contacts with others now.”In a press conference after his announcement, Mr Martin said: “I think it’s fair to say that quite a lot of these restrictions will continue on beyond the end of this month.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said: “The next three months in Ireland are going to be difficult, they will be as difficult as the last nine months were”, adding that while he was optimistic about vaccines it was important not to give people false hope.Mr Varadkar said 50,000 people were laid off on Christmas Eve when hospitality closed but that supports remain.On economic cost, Mr Martin said this was “significant”. Last week’s measures made 50,000 people unemployed and Wednesday’s measures could add 40,000 more.The National Public Health Emergency Team reported 13 coronavirus-related deaths and 1,718 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, more than the previous record reported on Tuesday.A Cabinet meeting was hastily arranged on Tuesday following what was described as an “exponential” increase in the number of cases, the highest number of hospitalisations since May and a massive rise in referrals of suspected cases in the past week.Minsters said they expected numbers to continue to grow sharply over the coming days reflecting increased social contacts at Christmas. “This is perhaps the most dangerous moment for the country since Covid-19 began,” said one Minister, speaking on the basis of anonymity.Vaccine rolloutIreland started its vaccine rollout on Tuesday and Annie Lynch, a 79-year-old Dublin grandmother, on Tuesday became the first person in the Republic to be vaccinated against Covid-19.She was among 2,000 people, mostly frontline health workers, who received the first supply of the vaccine in four hospitals in Dublin, Galway and Cork.Ireland is set to receive an additional one million doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine after the EU responded to surging case numbers by ramping up orders for the one treatment it has so far authorised.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447487.1609338802!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"review of allowances should look at other student groups as well as nurses siptu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin told the Dáil earlier this month that any exploitation of student nurses would not be tolerated. Photograph: Getty imagesThe Government is expected to look at backdating any changes recommended by a review group to allowances for student nurses to the start of the college year.An interim review of the allowances for first- to third-year student nurses, as well as the situation for those in fourth year who receive a pro-rated salary, is scheduled to be given to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on Thursday.This review will look at the current position in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. A second review to be completed in the weeks ahead will examine the situation in the medium to longer term. Meanwhile, the trade union Siptu has argued that the Government should introduce paid allowances for students in other healthcare disciplines such as radiography in addition to nurses and midwives.In its submission on the review Siptu said its terms of the reference were “quite limited”, and that it fully backed students across all grades being paid for their clinical placements in the health service. It said students on placement did not have access to sick leave and could lose out financially if they had to isolate due to contact with a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 case.The union suggested that the Government should consider introducing temporary healthcare assistant contracts for students across all grades.The Government announced the reviews of allowances after it came under strong pressure in recent weeks from the Opposition and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) over payments for student nurses who were on placement in hospitals and in relation to what they were being asked to do while on their placement.The Opposition maintained that students were effectively being asked to carry out work – without pay – similar to nurses on the regular roster during their placement rather than it being an opportunity for them to learn. The INMO declined to comment on its submission to the new review. Equal treatmentLast spring the then government appointed student nurses and midwives to paid healthcare assistant posts, a scheme that cost €41 million. Siptu argued strongly at the time that more than 50 student radiographers, who were working on the frontline in hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic, should receive equal treatment.He said student nurses who were rostered for work should be paid. He said personal experiences of inidual nurses during their placement, which had been raised in the Dáil, should be sent to the HSE and Department of Health for investigation.The HSE said last week that at senior management level it had not received any complaints from student nurses. It said details of all supports available had been brought to the attention of the students.It is understood that the Minister is seeking a report into claims made in the Dáil about the experiences of student nurses during their placements. It is unclear as to whether this report will be carried out by the HSE or by an independent third party."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447675.1609360463!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"third nationwide lockdown to last until at least the end of january","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin addresses the nation at  Government Buildings, Dublin, where he announced Ireland will face Level 5 coronavirus restrictions for at least a month.

Some 40,000 additional workers will be laid off in the coming weeks in light of the tightened restrictions. Businesses forced to close from Thursday will be given a double payment for two weeks under the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).‘Scarring effect’The Taoiseach warned, however, that there will be a long-term “scarring effect” on the economy.“The economic cost is significant. The concern we would have is around the impact on certain sectors and companies in terms of a long-term scarring effect, so we will continue to evaluate that.”While Mr Martin said schools will reopen on January 11th, a Government statement said there would be a “further review on the precise situation in advance of that date”.The Taoiseach said it is “fair to say quite a number of these restrictions will continue beyond the end of this month”.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said the ban on travel from Britain will be extended until January 6th while a separate ban on travel from South Africa has also been announced until the same date after a similar new strain of Covid-19 was found there.For the second day in a row, a new record for additional cases of the virus was set, with 1,718 positive tests reported. Another 13 Covid-related deaths were also confirmed.Public health officials responded to the worsening figures by telling people to “stay home” so transmission of the virus can be limited.Partial reductionThey also warned of up to 3,000 new cases a day and 1,200 patients in hospital by the end of January, even with partial reduction in transmission of the virus.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said Ireland was once again in a mitigation phase, meaning resources should be focused on those who are sickest.The Health Service Executive (HSE) warned the testing and contract tracing system is approaching maximum capacity.Continued exponential growth in cases will challenge the system and reduce the marginal benefit it provides, officials said.The benefit of iniduals taking action to prevent infection “far outweighs” what testing and tracing can currently achieve, HSE chief executive Paul Reid told a briefing.Most indicators of the disease have sharply deteriorated in the past week, with a 41 per cent increase in testing and a 129 per cent rise in contact-tracing calls.The number of Covid-19 patients in hospital increased to 455 on Wednesday, up from 411 the previous day. ICU numbers rose slightly to 37, up three.The reproduction number, a measure of the extent to which the virus is transmitting, is currently estimated at 1.6-1.8, and case numbers are doubling every seven to 10 days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447431.1609345164!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus northern ireland reports record 2 143 new cases","story":"The emergency approval of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine is a game changer as it can be distributed easily, says Professor Andrew Pollard, trial chief investigator at Oxford University.

Photograph: John Cairns  University of Oxford  AFPFor the second day in succession Northern Ireland reported a record number of confirmed coronavirus cases on Wednesday.On a day when a new Covid-19 vaccine received approval the department reported 2,143 Covid-19 cases, following on the record 1,566 positive cases it reported on Tuesday.This brought the total number of cases there since the outbreak of the pandemic to 70,905.Over the past seven days of the Christmas holiday 7,100 positive cases were reported in Northern Ireland – more than 1,000 each day.The department in its daily bulletin on Wednesday afternoon also recorded six more coronavirus deaths taking the death toll to 1,311.Hospital bed occupancy in the North stands at 96 per cent. There are 492 patients receiving Covid treatment with 35 in intensive care and 24 of them on ventilators.SchoolsThe Northern Ireland Assembly has been recalled to discuss next week’s planned reopening of schools amid strict lockdown measures.SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan welcomed support for his party’s Assembly recall petition, saying pupils, parents and teachers “need answers”.Mr McCrossan said: “With a huge rise in Covid-19 levels across our community, the fact that schools across the North are due to return in just days is deeply concerning.“Pupils, parents and teachers are extremely anxious and there has been a lack of clarity and support to reassure them and assist.“It is now essential that the Minister for Education outlines the medical and scientific evidence he has used to dogmatically rule out an extended school holiday.”The NASUWT teaching union has welcomed the recall. Justin McCamphill said: “There are no excuses for not now taking every step necessary to protect the wider community, school staff and young people and their families.”Gerry Murphy of the teachers’ trade union INTO wrote to First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill calling for online learning to be introduced.Mr Murphy said the Minister must act to protect pupils and teaching and non-teaching staff.“INTO is now demanding that online learning be introduced from day one of the second term in the interests of school communities and society generally. We urge him to act while time remains.”VaccineMeanwhile, the North’s health Minister Robin Swann said on Wednesday that approval of the OxfordAstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in the UK paved the way for a “significant acceleration” of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme.Mr Swann said that 50,000 OxfordAstraZeneca vaccines are currently available to Northern Ireland, with delivery arranged in advance of Wednesday’s announcement about its approval. Further supplies are expected early in the new year.Already in Northern Ireland more than 33,000 people have been vaccinated with the PfizerBioNTech vaccine which was approved in the UK on December 8th.“Today’s announcement is extremely welcome news and helps us look forward to the new year with optimism and hope,” said Mr Swann.But the Minister also warned that the coming weeks will be among the “most challenging yet” in the pandemic, with the North’s health service under immense pressure.“The vaccine programme will transform the situation but that will take time,” he said.Urging people to abide by the current six-week lockdown he added, “Between now and then, we need another big push to get through these next few months. We can all play our part in supporting the health service and in protecting each other from Covid-19. Please follow the public health advice to stop it spreading.”The approval of the OxfordAstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine means Northern Ireland GPs can begin the first phase of population vaccination from January 4th, starting with those aged 80 years and over.The programme will then be rolled out based on age and other clinical vulnerability factors. Prioritisation will be guided by the British Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The rate of progress will depend on the availability of the vaccine, in terms of both manufacture and supply.The initial phase of the PfizerBioNTech vaccination programme was focused on care home residents and staff, which were the number one priority as recommended by JCVI. Health and social care staff in direct contact with vulnerable patients also were offered vaccination.The health department said that 80 per cent of care homes have been visited. So far 8,940 care home residents, 10,484 care home staff and 14,259 health and social care staff have been vaccinated.The North’s chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine could be “more readily” taken to people. “It will make the task of vaccinating those most at risk and then the entire population over 50 years much more achievable,” he said.Patricia Donnelly, head of the North’s Covid-19 vaccination programme, said the “characteristics” of the OxfordAstraZeneca meant the department could “more rapidly scale up the vaccination programme roll-out, staying in line with the JCVI priority recommendations”.While the PfizerBioNTech vaccine must be stored and transported at -70 degrees and can only be stored in regular medical refrigerators at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to five days, the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around. – Additional reporting by PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447692.1609365047!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a how have we ended up going back to level 5 lockdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere has been mixed news on the vaccine front. Photograph: Brendan SmialowskiAFP via Getty ImagesBack to full-blown Level 5 then? And earlier than we thought. Why is it happening now? An emergency Cabinet meeting was held on Wednesday evening, with Covid-19 infections surging and the numbers in hospitals with the virus climbing alarmingly. After the meeting Taoiseach Micheál Martin confirmed the country was moving back to Level 5 in the Living with Covid-19 framework.Why was ramping-up of restrictions agreed to?It is all about the numbers. As the Cabinet was meeting, a further 1,718 cases of coronavirus were announced, bringing the total number of cases since the start of the pandemic to 90,157 in the Republic. Wednesday’s figure was the highest daily tally since the start of the crisis in February. A further 13 deaths relating to Covid-19 were also announced, taking the total number of deaths relating to the virus to 2,226.Are those numbers as terrible as they sound?Yes, and it has been widely anticipated that things are only likely to get worse in the days ahead. “This is perhaps the most dangerous moment for the country since Covid-19 began,” one Minister said ahead of the meeting.It is approaching capacity. With widespread transmission of the virus now occurring in the community, the benefit of iniduals taking action to prevent infection “far outweighs” what testing and tracing can achieve, according to HSE chief executive Paul Reid.So, what was decided at the Cabinet meeting?All Level 5 restrictions – including the closure on Thursday evening of non-essential retail as well as the re-imposition of restricted movement to within 5km of homes from midnight Wednesday – will take effect. Gyms and swimming pools must stay closed from close of business Thursday. Organised outdoor gatherings are not allowed. Funerals are limited to 10 mourners. Wedding parties cut to just six people from January 3rd. People are being asked to work from home. And school holidays are to be extended by almost a week.Yes. Even the smallest of New Year’s Eve house parties have been knocked on the head. The Government is ending a concession which would have allowed two families to socialise in one home until December 31st.And rules already in place will remain?Gastro-pubs and restaurants will have to stay closed, although takeaway and delivery services will be allowed. Hairdressers, salons, cinemas, galleries and museums also closed on Christmas Eve and will remain shut. Mass and religious services have moved online only.What about schools?Schools are to remain closed until January 11th. Students were due to return on January 6th.The Department of Housing has confirmed that a moratorium on evictions will be reintroduced from midnight on Wednesday until February 10th due to the curbs on travel.And when will all the new restrictions end?It is hard to say for sure. The Taoiseach said the restrictions will be in place until the end of January. However, he admitted many of the measures could remain beyond that point. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has previously indicated that there is a case for Level 5 restrictions staying in place until those most at risk are vaccinated.What about the vaccines?There has been mixed news on this front. By the end of the week about 40,000 doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine should be in the country. This will be followed by 40,000 per week throughout January and early February, which will largely be for nursing homes. Ireland is set to receive an additional one million doses after the EU responded to surging case numbers by ramping up orders for the one treatment it has so far authorised. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the EU will now take an additional 100 million doses of the vaccine, on top of the 200 million already ordered.And the bad news?There have been delays in the approval of other vaccines Ireland is due to get. The rollout of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine is unlikely to go ahead as hoped in January after a senior official in the European Medicines Agency said regulators did not have enough information about it. Ireland has ordered 3.3 million doses of this vaccine. It has also ordered 3.3 million doses of the SanofiGSK vaccine, but this is delayed until late 2021.And what about the new variant of Covid-19?At the time of writing seven cases of the new, more transmissible variant of Covid-19, first identified in the UK, have been sequenced in the Republic, along with one in Northern Ireland, according to a new risk assessment from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. It added that while there is no information to suggest that infections with the new strain are more severe, because of increased transmissibility, the impact of the virus is assessed as high in terms of hospitalisations and deaths.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Northern Ireland secretary could detract from Blair statement of regret, officials feared-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4446948.1609239615!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mozambique s jihadists gain ground as government declines help","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDisplaced women at the Centro Agrrio de Napala, where hundreds of displaced are sheltered, fleeing attacks by armed insurgents in different areas of Cabo Delgado. Photograph:  Alfredo ZunigaAFP via GettyMozambique has fought a largely losing battle with Islamist insurgents in its northern Cabo Delgado province in 2020, ceding control of important towns and ports despite numerous military operations to retake them.Nonetheless the government remains reluctant to accept help from neighbouring countries to tackle the three-year insurgency in which an estimated 2,400 militants, soldiers and civilians have died, and a further 570,000 have been displaced.That reluctance is likely to embolden the jihadists, who are known locally as Al-Shabaab (“the youth”) and claim to have links with the Islamic State terror group, to intensify their fight in 2021 to carve out a caliphate in the province, regional security analysts believe.Offers of international assistance to deal with the rebellion in resource-rich Cabo Delgado have poured into Maputo since April, when it first became clear that Mozambique’s troops and military strategy were struggling to keep the insurgents at bay.But to date President Filipe Nyusi’s Frelimo party, which has ruled the country since independence from Portugal was negotiated in 1975 after 10 years of war, has relied on private sector security companies from Russia, and more recently South Africa, to fight the militants.However, the escalating situation has left him under pressure to accept large-scale support from western stakeholders and Mozambique’s neighbours, as they fear the insurgency will spill over into their backyards.Liesl Louw, senior researcher with South Africa’s Institute of Security Studies, says the situation in Cabo Delgado is dire, with Al-Shabaab expanding its presence into 10 of the province’s 17 districts in recent weeks.She believes the creation of a regional force supported by a clear African Union-developed military strategy would be the best way to help the Mozambique Defence Armed Forces to defeat the insurgents.“Once this was achieved the AU could call on the international community to finance the plan, but all this would take time. In the interim Al-Shabaab is likely to continue with its tactics, given its successes in 2020,” she says.However, Louw says the government of the former Portuguese colony appears to be reluctant to accept outside help because of fears it might undermine the country’s hard-won sovereignty.“There is also the issue of national pride,” she says, “and a belief that Mozambicans should deal with their own problems”.Joint operationsMozambique did sign an agreement in late November with Tanzania to launch joint operations to combat Al-Shabaab, as Nyusi has said some of its recruits and leaders are from the east African nation, which shares its southern border with Cabo Delgado.But Jasmine Opperman, a South Africa-based analyst with Armed Conflict Location and Events Data, a violence monitoring group, has questioned how effective the collaboration can be against the terror group, and whether civilians will get caught in the middle again.“What will be the cost of these limited cross-border operations given Al-Shabaab is likely to intensify its war on the back of its successes in 2020? Will we see more civilians targeted by both sides?” she wonders.Al-Shabaab has been accused of brutally killing civilians this year by international rights groups, but so too have Mozambican troops, which has highlighted the government’s own governance failures in the province.Nyusi has repeatedly blamed foreign extremists for the insurgency, rather than seeing it as a home-grown uprising by the province’s marginalised population.But researchers say the unrest is strongly linked to the levels of poverty and inequality in the province, which has vast mineral and gas resources that multinational corporations aim to extract, with little discernible benefit to locals.Delivering his state-of-the-nation address on December 16th, Nyusi confirmed Mozambique had received offers of help from around the world, but he seemed to suggest that foreign troop interventions were not a viable option.“We Mozambicans need to develop our own skills,” he maintained. “We will be on the front line of defending the country. Nobody will do it for us.”Indeed, the government’s reluctance to embrace outside help is evident in how it has engaged with the European Union (EU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) on their offer of assistance in Cabo Delgado.The EU has indicated it will provide military training for Mozambique’s troops as well as medical and humanitarian support, if international human rights and the rule of law are adhered to.SADC, the region’s main intergovernmental body, has also offered to help, but it has said it first needs Mozambique to present it with a credible plan that outlines how and where it should get involved.However, by mid-December Mozambique’s negotiations with both bodies had started to falter, despite the urgency of the situation.‘We cannot move’EU foreign affairs commissioner Josep Borrell publicly confirmed on December 16th that it had yet to receive “the green light” to send its security experts to assess the situation in Cabo Delgado even though the EU team was ready to go.“We have problems in Mozambique: we cannot move, we cannot travel around,” he told the European Parliament.SADC’s defence and security organ also took part in a rescheduled meeting with Mozambique’s government on December 14th, but the talks in Maputo to address the crisis were postponed until January 2021 without any signs of progress.In light of the difficult negotiations and escalating violence, Louw says it would be naive to think foreign military assistance could be rolled out in Mozambique before July.“If a regional force is going to help Mozambique it will need 30,000 troops to tackle 5,000 insurgents,” she says. “This will take time to organise, even if things go according to plan, as SADC is weak in terms of its capacity.”Opperman also sees little chance of the tide turning against Al-Shabaab next year, as the capacity and willingness of the Mozambican government to accept regional help is limited.“The army will most likely focus on violence hot spots to give a false sense to the world that the crisis is under control, rather than allowing foreign boots on the ground to help tackle Al-Shabaab decisively,” she says.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4443817.1608634385!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s time to pop ireland s anglophone bubble","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Ireland is in an Anglophone bubble that will be a disadvantage now that its future lies in the European Union.’Ireland is in an Anglophone bubble that will be a disadvantage now that its future lies in the European Union while both Britain and the United States are in retreat as global powers. It’s time for the bubble to be popped.Irish people coast on the status of English as an international lingua franca. To a certain extent this is an advantage – Irish speechwriters are in demand in Brussels – but it is also marginalising.The Anglophone bubble means that Irish people are more familiar with the dynamics of the US Congress or Westminster than they are with matters with quite direct import for the country and the internal EU balance of power, such as who may replace German chancellor Angela Merkel or the upcoming presidential race in France.It may be contributing to the shortage of Irish people joining EU institutions. Just five Irish citizens entered the concours recruitment programme for the EU institutions in the last five years – far below the level needed to replace those retiring, and potentially making for a shortage in influential positions in years to come.For Ireland to function effectively in the EU, this will have to change.With Britain’s exit from the EU, Ireland has lost a major ally in defending its interests. To advocate for itself now, the country will need multilingual advocates who are fluent not just in different languages but also in the history and culture of our EU allies.Painfully often, the Irish figures in any given room in Brussels are linguistically limited, and it shapes their opportunities and how people behave towards them. It’s assumed that English should be used for the Irish person’s benefit, that translation will be required if other languages are used, and it excludes the Irish person from conversations, opportunities, and involvement.The same goes for most British, American, or Australians as fellow Anglophones, but in Brussels now it’s just the Irish in the room.Discussion of the issue often rapidly descends into psychodrama and self-flagellation, with an outpouring of old grievances about school experiences and complex feelings towards Irish.Please resist reacting to this article along these old familiar lines. There’s nothing surprising or unusual in the low level of foreign language skills we have in Ireland. It’s not due to a unique failing in our schooling system.This is a phenomenon that is common to all the Anglophone countries, and it’s because we can get away with it. The sheer amount of media produced by Britain and the US and their cultural clout means that Irish people can easily live in a comfortable bubble of English and never need venture out of it. Exposure to other languages is simply drowned out by the volume.The situation is different for people in countries in which the dominant language is something other than English. They will come up against English all the time, whether in the films on in the cinema or the songs of their favourite popstars, alongside the imperative that to learn broadens horizons.We err in Ireland in sometimes thinking that we can only afford one other non-English language. A typical European might in different scenarios grow up using a local language, one or more “official” national tongues, English, and whatever is spoken in the countries next door. Multilingualism is a global norm, not the exception, as is several languages being used within families.In a typical day in my job, I might be responding to emails in French, organising a delivery in Dutch, making calls in Italian, following a press conference in any of the other 27 EU languages, and with a cúpla focal here and there as Gaeilge through a press conference with Micheál Martin or texts with a friend.As is the norm, my comfort level in different languages varies according to the scenario and how frequently I’m using them. Mostly, my speech is clumsy and error-strewn, but every bit of knowledge I have of languages is concretely and practically useful in my everyday life.How to pop the Anglophone bubble in Ireland is a challenging question, but I do have one idea based on my own experience.Classroom learning of languages never worked for me. But I found exposure to real-life use of languages transformational. Whether visiting the Gaeltacht as a teenager or on an exchange to Italy, I found that when the language was used around me and I needed to adopt it to communicate, I became conversant within weeks.My suggestion is therefore that Ireland should become the EU’s strongest advocate for expanding take-up of the Erasmus programme and extending it to exchanges at secondary school level. It’s something that has the potential to transform the lives of young people, but may also be seriously important for Ireland’s strategic interests in the years ahead.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447686.1609362536!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"almost entire population of england to be under most severe covid restrictions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrime minister Boris Johnson speaking in  Downing Street following the tightening of England’s Covid-19 tiers. Photograph: PA PhotoAlmost the entire population of England will be under the most severe coronavirus restrictions from Thursday after Boris Johnson said a new variant of the virus was surging. The new restrictions were announced hours after British regulators approved the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is cheaper and easier to distribute than the Pfizer vaccine that was the first to be rolled out.Mr Johnson told a press conference in Downing Street that it was “very frustrating” to be in a position where the new strain of the virus was raging while the new vaccine brought such hope.“We have to face the fact that we’ve got two big things happening at once in our fight against Covid – one’s working for us and one’s working against us.“On the plus side we have got two valid vaccines, and we’re racing to get them out – and on the bad side there is a new strain of the virus which is spreading much faster and surging across the country.”Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, the AstraZeneca product does not need to be kept at extremely low temperatures and thawed out before use. Both approved vaccines require two doses a few weeks apart, but the British authorities have revised their vaccination plan to prioritise giving the first dose to as many people as possible and delaying the second dose until up to three months later.“The great news is people get protection after the first dose. This means we can accelerate the speed at which we can vaccinate people for the first 12 weeks before we return to deliver the second doses for that longer-term protection,” health secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons.Britain has ordered tens of millions of the new vaccine, but Mr Hancock admitted that just over half a million would be available from next Monday. New variantBritain reported\u0026nbspa further 50,023 new coronavirus cases and 981 more deaths on Wednesday, more than twice the death figure for the previous day. The government’s scientific advisers said the new variant of the virus was especially prevalent in London and the southeast of England, but was spreading throughout the country.The new measures mean that 44 million people, almost 80 per cent of England’s population, will be under Tier 4 restrictions. The government has also delayed the reopening of schools in some parts of the country, and told third-level colleges that students should not return until mid-January at the earliest.“At this critical moment, with the prospect of freedom within reach, we’ve got to redouble our efforts to contain the virus. No one regrets these measures more bitterly than I do, but we must take firm action now,” Mr Johnson said.“We must face the reality the sheer pace of the spread of this new variant requires us now to take even tougher action in some areas, and that does affect schools.”\u0026nbspStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447645.1609371616!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk mps back brexit trade agreement by 521 votes to 73","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour leader Keir Starmer during the debate in the House of Commons on the Brexit Bill on Wednesday.

The House of Commons backed the deal by\u0026nbsp521 votes to 73, as Labour voted with the government while all other opposition parties voted against.The deal is on the verge of becoming law after it received an unopposed third reading in the House of Lords late on Wednesday night.All but two Conservative MPs backed the deal, with Brexiteers Owen Paterson and John Redwood abstaining because it leaves the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol unchanged. Thirty-five Labour MPs and former party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who currently sits as an Independent, abstained and one voted against.Keir Starmer said Labour was backing the Bill giving effect to the deal because the only alternative was to leave the post-Brexit transition without a deal. But he criticised the deal as lacking provision for services which make up 80 per cent of the British economy and said Mr Johnson had failed to resolve the dilemma at the heart of his negotiating strategy.“The prime minister pretends that he has got sovereignty, and zero tariffs and zero quotas. He has not: the moment he exercises the sovereignty to depart from the level playing field, the tariffs kick in. This is not a negotiating triumph,” he said.‘Torn’Mr Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary, said he felt “very torn” because although he wished the agreement well, he could not vote for a measure that would leave the North under EU regulations and customs rules. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he believed that, because of Brexit and the Conservative government’s handling of it, the United Kingdom was coming to an end.“To my unionist neighbours, I want to say this: look at where the DUP has led you and look at where London has left you.\u0026nbspIt is my firm conviction that we can build a new society together – one built on mutual respect, which recognises and celebrates all our rich traditions,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Young people everywhere rejected Brexit. Thankfully, in Northern Ireland, young people will have a choice again. They will be able to choose a European future again. They will be able to choose an open, liberal and modern future, which is a prize worth fighting for.”AcrimonyTom Tugendhat, the Conservative chairman of the foreign affairs committee, said that after years of acrimony and anger about Britain’s relationship with Europe, it was time to move on.“I am going to vote, alongside members of the Dáil and parliaments around Europe, to back this treaty. I am going to recognise that the European Union has made an offer and we have accepted it, and that we have made one and they have accepted it, and I am going to respect that,” he said.“We have been in the EU for only 47 years – that is the life of a Hohenzollern empire. We are leaving the EU, just as Germany left that empire, and we will find a new way of working together. This deal is but the first step on that journey it is just the concordat that bridges the channel and looks to future co-operation.” – Additional reporting PA\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Ideas have even been crowd sourced through social media.  “Young soldiers with fresh ideas, combined with experienced instructors and professionals have attacked it in a different way,” Lt Col Page said. Camouflaging a tank at ranges up to 300 metres is almost impossible as soldiers will almost always spot the vehicle. Equally, beyond 1000 metres, the colours meld in the visible spectrum so tanks look just like black boxes and camouflage patterns add little. Historically most anti-tank weapon system engagements occur between 300 and 1,000 metres. The new design has been targeted to work best between these ranges. Introducing confusion in man or machine for even a couple of seconds could make the difference between the enemy creating a smoking hull or receiving the business end of 60-tonnes of British Defence policy.“If I can delay that targeting cycle, that\u0027s a win, because this thing doesn\u0027t operate on its own,” says Major Charlie Brunskill. “Once an anti-tank team shows itself and goes through that cycle, if I can add three more seconds to that I can perhaps get a shot off first.” The new design consists of a mixture of pixellated blocks of five colours, with different thermal and infra-red properties. The resultant camouflage makes it hard for soldiers and drones to recognise what they are seeing.Recent experience from the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan shows how vulnerable tanks can be to airborne assets.However, enemy weapon systems relying on Artificial Intelligence to recognise the visual, thermal or electronic signature of a tank can also be spoofed.Multi-spectral paint schemes and modern technology can confuse drones into thinking the tank is a different vehicle, or even in a slightly different place.It means enemy drones could expend valuable weapons unnecessarily, or be unable to fire as they cannot understand what they are looking at.  David Willey, curator of the Tank museum, says painting the tank in a modern design that is not “boring standard Nato green” also has a psychological effect on friend and foe alike. “Never underestimate the impact of heavy armour: what it looks like and what its presence is,” he said.Major Brunskill agrees, saying interest in the concept has been “phenomenal”. “It’s like giving the Armoured Corps a new uniform.“It\u0027s just like putting stripes on your car as a kid it goes 10 per cent faster,” he said. “That has an effect on the enemy as well.” Lt Col Page says the new design is not “bumper-sticker vanity”.“It not only increases survivability, it makes the best of community interest around vehicles and around innovation in a way that we wouldn\u0027t normally do. “This has created a buzz in the armoured community because it shown that really low level innovation can have a massive impact. It’s about pride in the vehicle and people.”He said the Challenger 2 equipped Cavalry regiments in the army are clamouring to get the new design. “That\u0027s exactly what we want.”“For defence I think that really shows what an enterprise we are. It’s not just the soldier in the vehicle. It’s the links to industry, science, the museum and the community of interest. We couldn’t do what we do without it. “These innovations used to be the preserve of specialist units. We’ve democratised that process.“You can deceive the technology and the human.

lowering barriers for EU businesses, bolstering competition and strengthening environmental protection.The bloc says it has also managed to get Beijing to agree to “continued and sustained efforts” to ratify International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions on forced labour.“We have to remain realistic: this deal will not solve all the China-related challenges we face, of which there are many,” EU executive vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said“However, it ties China into significant commitments in the right direction - more than it has ever agreed before”.But European lawmakers warned that there is no way to compel China to make good on worker rights.And some in Brussels accuse Beijing of running a “government-led system of forced labour” targeting the Uighur and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province.China pushed past the United States in the third quarter of this year to become the EU\u0027s top trade partner as the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the US economy while Chinese activity rebounded.The political accord comes just weeks before Biden will be sworn in as US president and with his team expressing concern over the EU\u0027s outreach to Beijing and urging Brussels to consult with Washington.While the deal should pave the way for EU firms to make inroads in areas including China\u0027s electric car, health, telecoms and financial services sectors, it also looks set to open up Europe\u0027s renewable energy market to Beijing.But an EU official said that the agreement would still allow inidual member states to block access for Chinese firms on national security grounds.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"looking commitment best use app study finds couples meet online","story":"Couples who connect through smartphone dating apps are more likely to move in together than those who meet in person in a social setting, according to a new study.Researchers have found that online daters have stronger long term relationship goals than peers who get together in more traditional ways, such as at the office or pub.Dating apps including Tinder, Bumble and Hinge have been criticised for fuelling casual sex, but spreading the net wider increases the chances of settling down with \u0027Mr or Mrs Right\u0027, say psychologists from the University of Geneva.An analysis of more than 3,000 over 18s in Switzerland showed couples who met on an app were more motivated by the idea of cohabiting.In addition, women who found their partner this way show greater desires and intentions to have children than peers whose relationship was born offline.Study lead author Dr Gina Potarca, of the University of Geneva, said cohabiting is viewed as as a trial period prior to marriage.“It\u0027s a pragmatic approach in a country where the orce rate is consistently around 40 per cent.With many social settings now shut because of the pandemic, more people are turning to dating apps instead of attempting to meet people outside the home. Dr Potarca said: The internet is profoundly transforming the dynamics of how people meet.It provides an unprecedented abundance of meeting opportunities, and involves minimal effort and no third-party intervention.Her findings, published in the journal PLOS One, add to increasing evidence dating apps boost the chances of compatibility - and reduce the risk of orce.Dr Potarca said: Large parts of the media claim they have a negative impact on the quality of relationships since they render people incapable of investing in an exclusive or long-term relationship.Up to now, though, there has been no evidence to prove this is the case.Her team looked at 3,235 participants in a Swiss government family survey who were in a relationship and had come across their partner in the last decade.The most committed to sharing a home tended to be those who had met on apps rather than in a non-digital environment.The study also found these apps play an important role in modifying the composition of couples by making them more erse.In particular, this applied to highly educated women and less educated men getting together.Dr Potarca said this may have to do with selection methods that focus mainly on the visual.Since users can easily connect with partners in their immediate region, but also in other spaces as they move around, the apps make it easier to meet people more than 30 minutes away - leading to an increase in long-distance relationships.Dr Potarca added: Knowing dating apps have likely become even more popular during this year\u0027s periods of lockdown and social distancing, it is reassuring to dismiss alarming concerns about the long-term effects of using these tools.A previous study of 19,000 people by researchers from the University of Chicago found couples who meet online tend to communicate better and have longer, happier relationships. The rate of marital breakups was 25 per cent lower.The researchers suggested a greater pool of potential spouses might give users more options and allow them to be more selective.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pm hooks carping snp leader plays commons debate lands boris","story":"Little is certain in British politics, but some things happen as regularly as the tides. So it was at the Commons EU debate on Wednesday. Barely had the Prime Minister begun his opening sallies when the leader of the Scottish National Party in the House of Commons, Ian Blackford, intervened – leaping out of his seat like a performing killer whale at the first mention of sovereignty over British waters. Winding up the SNP’s Westminster spokesman does not demand the subtlety of a crack fly-fisher – a certain cliché involving barrels and seafood springs to mind – and Mr Blackford duly glowered as Boris raved about mackerel stocks and juicy Scottish cod.However, the PM, although feigning a conciliatory air, was in an impish mood and deployed a favourite tease – casually branding the SNP the Scottish Nationalist Party.It was simple as netting minnows, but devastatingly effective. Mr Blackford took the bait like a salmon snapping at a cunningly tied fly.“The name of my party is the Scottish National Party!”, he carped with indignation. “I am using the word nationalist with a small ‘n’”, smirked the PM. “What this bill does is take back control ... ”At this Mr Blackford resurfaced, spluttering, but Boris dismissed him with an airy cast of the hand.He redoubled his provocation as the shoal of SNP MPs bristled like sticklebacks.“The declared position of the Scottish National – nationalist – Party is to hand control of the very waters we’ve just reclaimed straight back to the EU!” Amid baying and chuntering, the Leader of the Opposition battled vainly to inject some sobriety into proceedings.He warned of “an avalanche of checks, bureaucracy and red tape”. Like the runner-up in the angling contest, trying to preserve his dignity, he reluctantly conceded “a thin deal is better than no deal” and called for unity across the House. The sentiment was noble, the delivery limp as a dead lamprey. Theresa May – not one of Parliament’s obvious wind-up merchants – managed to troll the Government and Labour simultaneously by insisting that if Sir Keir Starmer wanted a better deal, he should have voted for hers.“I will take no lectures from the Leader of the Opposition”, she crowed, wagging a finger as she administered her verbal king. For three decades, Tory splits over Europe have been a fixture of politics now MPs massed, thrashing in violent agreement. The Father of the House and erstwhile Remainer Sir Peter Bottomley ironically thanked Mr Blackford for his 25-minute “lesson in humility”, before endorsing the deal.ERG stalwart Bernard Jenkin accused a Labour opponent of quibbling “about whether the glass is half-full or half-empty”, and endeavoured to plug the gap with a mention of the soon-to-be-scrapped tampon tax. Sir Iain Duncan Smith continued the ritual anointing and classical metaphor. Gesturing at the PM, he thanked “my Right Honourable friend, the member for Athens”, chuckling unaccompanied at his own joke. Here followed a lesson from the gospel of St Mark Francois, who regaled the chamber with verses from Isaiah.He came unarmed and spoke of peace, yet demanded constant vigilance “in case one day, someone – perhaps the Leader of the Opposition – should try and take us back in.” Like a narwhal, or possibly a Kipper, this ERG Spartan wasn’t laying down his spear just yet. Ian Blackford then unveiled a bewildering panorama of historical references in defence of Scottish exceptionalism from the Medieval Auld Alliance and Hanseatic League right up until that pesky Act of Union put paid to their Europhilia. Centuries passed in a heartbeat, although in the chamber time stood still as he droned on.The Corbynistas, too, tended the flame like unrepentant Jacobins, vowing disobedience in honour of their fallen comrade. However, these flounderings seemed a drop in the ocean compared to the sea of troubles against which the PM and his fleet had taken arms – and prevailed. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"republican senator contest electoral college win joe biden","story":"A Republican senator on Wednesday announced that he would object next week when Congress convenes to certify the electoral college vote, in a doomed attempt to upend Joe Biden’s victory.Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri broke with Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader, and other prominent Republicans in declaring he would contest the certification of electoral college vote, following calls to do so from President Donald Trump.The challenge, which would prompt a floor debate and force senators to go on the record as to whether they believe there were voting irregularities in the November 3 election, means there will be at least a short delay in Mr Biden’s confirmation.Mr Trump will inevitably lose that vote, as Democrats control the House and a number of Senate Republicans have publicly recognised Mr Biden’s victory, including Senator Mitt Romney, who has called the president’s refusal to accept the election dangerous.Even in the unlikely event that Mr Trump were to prevail in the Senate, where Mike Pence, Vice President, would be in position to cast a tie-breaking vote if needed, the challenge still would fail given the House vote.Mr McConnell and other senior Republicans had sought to avoid a vote that will see Republicans forced to take sides either with or against the president. Mr Hawley, a constitutional lawyer, said he felt compelled to highlight purported election irregularities despite there being no evidence of any.“Millions of voters concerned about election integrity deserve to be heard,” he wrote on Twitter. “I will object on January 6 on their behalf.”“At the very least, Congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections. But Congress has so far failed to act,” Mr Hawley said. The 40-year-old senator is rumoured to be positioning himself as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, and his move could be designed to appeal to the tens of millions of loyal Trump supporters.The Department of Justice, the Department for Homeland Security, election boards, judges, and other authorities have found no evidence of election malfeasance that impacted the President-elect Biden’s decisive win. The US Supreme Court has also declined to intervene. Any member of the House or Senate can contest the electoral votes on January 6. On Wednesday, Mr Pence refused to sign on to a plan that would upend Congress certifying the election for Mr Biden. Representative Louie Gohmert and Arizona\u0027s slate of Republican Electoral College “electors” filed a federal lawsuit to get a judge to say Mr Pence has the power to pick pro-Trump electors when he presides over the January Congressional session.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"south korea orders sale mitsubishi assets compensate japans","story":"South Korea is to sell the assets of a Japanese firm to compensate a group of citizens who were forced to work as labourers during the years of Tokyo’s colonial rule of the peninsula.A court in the city of Daejon ruled on Tuesday that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries must forfeit assets worth £565,000. The verdict is the final step in a 2018 order by the Korean Supreme Court for Mitsubishi to pay between £68,000 and £102,000 to four plaintiffs who were forced to work for the firm between 1910  and 1945. Japan has yet to comment on the verdict but has in the past expressed anger over the case and suggested it may impose sanctions in retaliation. A number of other similar cases are pending in Korean courts, including compensation claims against Nippon Steel \u0026amp Sumitomo Metal Corp. The Japanese government insists that all claims linked to the years of Japan’s colonial rule were “settled completely and finally” with the signing of a treaty in June 1965 that normalised diplomatic relations between Seoun and Tokyo, and included grants amounting to US $300 million that were tacitly seen as compensation. While Japan says the treaty should be the end of the matter, Korean courts have sided with former labourers who claim they have not received redress directly from Japanese companies or the government for their suffering. The South Korean government has also refused requests from Japan to intervene in the cases on the grounds that they are a matter for the courts.Mitsubishi is understood to be preparing to file an appeal against the decision, although previous appeals have been summarily dismissed. In 2019, after an earlier development in the case, Japan imposed new restrictions on exports of chemicals critical to South Korea’s semiconductor industry. It is likely that Tokyo has drawn up a similar response should the Mitsubishi assets - six patent and two trademark rights - be sold off. It has been suggested that Tokyo may impose new tariffs on imports or raise existing duties, restrict the issuance of visas, impose new financial sanctions, restrict the operations of Korean companies in Japan and recall the ambassador to Seoul.The Japanese government is unwilling to let the cases go uncontested, however, as it fears that one victory over its companies will open the floodgates to countless similar cases from other Koreans or the descendants of forced labourers who have since died. And if Koreans are successful in compensation suits against Japanese corporations, then that could open the floodgates to similar claims from people in other parts of Asia who also feel they were victims of Imperial Japan’s actions in the early decades of the last century.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"three quarters england plunged toughest tiers new coronavirus","story":"More than three quarters of the population will be living under strict Tier 4 restrictions from Thursday after Matt Hancock said soaring Covid cases made tougher measures for 20 million more people absolutely necessary.The Health Secretary announced on Wednesday that the Midlands, the North-East, parts of the North-West and parts of the South-West would go into the toughest lockdown tier at one minute past midnight on New Year\u0027s Eve.In total, 44 million people in England – 78.3 per cent of the population – will be living under Tier 4 regulations, which ban hospitality venues, non-essential shops and gyms from opening. The rules also instruct people to stay at home, with permission to leave only for a specific purpose or if there is a reasonable excuse.Liverpool has moved back up to Tier 3, despite hosting a mass-testing pilot scheme last month. Mr Hancock said the city had done so much and got the rates right down under control, but signalled that infections had started to rise again due to the newly identified mutant virus strain.The Isle of Wight saw the most drastic change in restrictions, moving from Tier 1 to Tier 4 in a single week due to spiralling infections.NHS England reported a further 494 coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals across the country on Wednesday.Mr Hancock said the newly approved Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca vaccine, due to be rolled out from Monday, would help bring an end to the virus misery.However, he said there had been little choice but to extend the blasted restrictions, particularly due to the new Covid strain, which Boris Johnson said was responsible for 60 per cent of new cases.In a televised Downing Street press conference, the Prime Minister urged the UK to redouble its efforts to contain the virus at this critical moment.He expressed confidence that things will be very much better by Easter on April 5 but warned that Covid was currently surging and said: I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the New Year safely at home.Speaking in the Commons earlier, Mr Hancock said: We must act to suppress the virus now, not least because the new variant makes the time between now and then even more difficult. And so whilst we have the good news of the vaccine today, we also have to take some difficult decisions.The Government said infection rates have increased faster than expected in areas where the new strain has been circulating, including the South-West, the Midlands and parts of the North-West, and that stronger measures are required to get the virus under control.Mr Hancock said: Sharply rising cases and the hospitalisations that follow demonstrate the need to act where the virus is spreading.I know that Tier 3 and Tier 4 measures place a significant burden on people, and especially on businesses affected, but I am afraid it is absolutely necessary because of the number of cases that we\u0027ve seen. But where we are still able to give places greater freedoms, we will continue to do so.Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary,  said Labour would support the tougher regulations but warned that months of restrictions were having a huge impact on families and small businesses.Pressure continued to grow from some quarters for a national lockdown, with Zarah Sultana, the Labour MP for Coventry South, saying the tiers system had failed.The virus is totally out of control, hospitals are overwhelmed and NHS staff are on their knees, she warned. We need a national lockdown – with full financial support – and this time it should include online learning at schools and universities.Nine local leaders in the North-East also called for a consistentnationwide approach. In a joint statement the council chiefs, mayors and Police and Crime Commissioner said: Our view is that the Government should consider a national lockdown now to ensure the spread of the new variant is slowed and efforts can be focused on the crucial roll-out of the vaccine.This is a national problem, and a national solution is required now.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit deal eu becomes law","story":"NewsBrexit deal with EU becomes law as the Queen gives official Royal AssentBoris Johnson said he hoped the deal would end years of \"tired\" arguments after The European UnionBill was rushed through the Commons and Lords in a single daymirrorShare Bill was rushed through the Commons and Lords in a single day\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _THP_CHP_SLUG_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" Bill was rushed through the Commons and Lords in a single day\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _THP_CHP_SLUG_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" Bill was rushed through the Commons and Lords in a single day\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _THP_CHP_SLUG_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\"CommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political EditorRyan Merrield:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsBoris Johnson signing the Brexit deal\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Boris Johnsonaposs EU trade agreement cleared Parliament late on Wednesday night after the Government rushed approval through the Commons and Lords in a single day. Peers gave the European UnionBill, ratying the deal finally agreed on Christmas Eve, an unopposed third reading.Their approval came just hours after MPs backed the Bill by  to  at third reading, with just two Tories abstaining but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer suffered a rebellion. Her Majestyaposs approval paves the way for the deal to take effect at pm on Thursday when the current Brexit transition period, during which the UK has continued to follow EU rules, ends.It means the UK and EU will trade without tarfs and quotas. But businesses are still braced for confusion and chaos as they get to grips with the new arrangements, despite the PM assuring the deal provides certainty for all firms.  A statement from Mr Johnson said: The destiny of this great country now resides firmly in our hands.We take on this duty with a sense of purpose and with the interests of the British public at the heart of everything we do. pm on the st December marks a new beginning in our countryaposs history and a new relationship with the EU as their biggest ally. This moment is finally upon us and now is the time to seize it.  Hours earlier he told the Commons he hoped it would end the old, desiccated, tired, super-masticated arguments which have dogged the country for years and enable it to move forwards to a new and great future. He said what had been agreed had been dismissed by some as “impossible”.The Conservative leader added: We were told we could not have our cake and eat it – namely that we could trade and co-operate with our EU neighbours on the closest possible terms as we will, while retaining sovereign control of our laws and our national destiny.  We are going to open a new chapter in our national story, striking free trade deals around the world and reasserting global Britain as a liberal outward-looking force for good. Mr Starmer told his party to back the deal –  did so, while  defied the orders. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, Northern Irish MPs and the Greens’ one representative voted against. Two Tories – veteran Eurosceptics Owen Paterson and John Redwood, both former Cabinet ministers – abstained.  Despite voting for the deal, Mr Starmer tore into what he called a “thin agreement”.He said it failed to make good on Brexiteers’ promises during the referendum campaign. He said claims the pact would ensure there would be no checks on goods travelling between the UK and the Continent were wrong. Mr Starmer added: “There will be an avalanche of checks, bureaucracy and red tape for British businesses. “Every business I have spoken to knows this... It is there in black and white in the treaty.  “There will be checks for farmers, manufacturers, for customs, on rules of origin, VAT, safety and security, plant and animal health and much more. Many British exporters will have to go through two regulatory processes to sell to existing clients in the EU.” But he added that failing to back the agreement meant leaving with no deal at all. But the suffered by his party prompted two junior shadow ministers, Helen Hayes and Tonia Antoniazzi, to announce they were resigning their posts on the Labour front bench as they could not support the agreement. One Labour MP, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, defied the whips to vote against the agreement while another  abstained. All the other opposition parties opposed the agreement, including the DUP, which backed Brexit but objects to provisions which mean Northern Ireland will still be subject to some EU rules.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford told the Commons the European UnionAct is an act of constitutional vandalism. In a point of order, he said: I rise to say that this is an act of constitutional vandalism. Weaposre in the position this evening that the three devolved parliaments in Edinburgh, Cardf and in Belfast have refused to give legislative consent. It is the practice that this House is only supposed to legislate on matters that concern the devolved administrations with their consent.  Tory Eurosceptics, meanwhile, were jubilant, declaring that the battle for Brexit had finally been won. Veteran Sir Bill Cash said: Like Alexander the Great, Boris has cut the Gordian Knot. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle announced the Queenaposs approval to MPs at .am on Thursday morning. An opposition amendment criticising the many shortcomings of the deal was rejected by  votes to . A Liberal Democrat attempt to prevent the legislation passing with a so-called fatal amendment was heavily defeated by  votes to , majority . Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: “This deal will make British people poorer and British people less safe. At Holyrood, the Scottish Parliament voted by  to  to deny the deal legislative consent, although First Minister Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged it would not affect the passage of the Bill at Westminster.

The ,-page document has already been signed by EU leaders in Brussels - and was being flown on one of the Queen’s VIP planes to London.Ex-PM Theresa May today said she would back the Future Relationship Bill - and so did Keir Starmer, despite some Labour frontbenchers being expected to resign.But Mrs May sent a warning shot to Mr Johnson over the small print of the deal. She said she was “disappointed” about its approach to financial services, as it gives no automatic right of access between the UK and EU. Mrs May said she pledged in  to work to get a truly ground-breaking deal for this sector, adding: Sadly it has not been achieved.” She also warned a new ‘Partnership Council’, which will thrash out disputes, can carry out its vital work without any checks by the UK Parliament. “Sovereignty does not mean isolationism,” she warned. “It does not mean we never accept someone ’s rules.” The Tory ex-PM wagged her finger at Keir Starmer as she accused him of scuppering her bid to get a “better deal” in . But her message was also meant for new PM Boris Johnson - who voted down her deal at the time and used the ensuing chaos to get to Downing Street.  In a thinly-veiled rebuke, she said: “Today is the time to put aside personal and party political interests - which sadly too many have followed in the past.” Tory MPs struck down a bid to give MPs two hours to debate amendments to the Future Relationship Bill - instead giving them precisely zero minutes. That means MPs are set to overwhelmingly back the Brexit trade deal during today’s emergency recall of Parliament. It is expected to pass the Commons just before pm before being rushed through the Lords and gaining Royal Assent from the Queen just before midnight. Tory eurosceptics threw their weight behind the pact and Labour MPs have also been ordered to support the agreement, which allows for tarf free trade between the UK and EU. Keir Starmer is braced for frontbench resignations from MPs in Remain-voting seats. They fear the party could end up sharing the blamefirms suffer. Sir Keir was forced onto the defensive as he warned MPs: “There’s only once choice today - which is to vote for implementing this deal, or to vote for no deal. “Those who vote no are voting for no deal.” He added: “It’s not a mark of how pro-European you are to reject implementing this treaty.” Yet he also pointed out flaws in the Brexit deal.  Boris Johnson has boasted the UK can set its own laws in future - but the EU will be able to retaliate in tarfswe erge too far from its standards on the environment, state aid or workers’ rights. “The Prime Minister hasn’t escaped that dilemma - he’s negotiated a treaty that bakes it in,” Sir Keir said. The Prime Minister also made a highly misleading claim about fish as he urged MPs to back the deal.  Mr Johnson told MPs: “In five and a half years time we will be able to fish every single fish in our waterswe so choose.” But in reality,the UK did this it could collapse the entire deal. After , there will be annual negotiations over how many fish go to UK and EU fishermen in UK waters.  But the deal says those negotiations should normally lead to each side getting a quota thataposs reasonably commensurate with what they had before. Andthe UK acts unfairly, the EU can take “compensatory measures” or - in the worst case scenario - collapse the trade part of the deal entirely as a result. Mr Johnson also wrongly claimed firms would not face a “thicket of trade barriers” - despite the fact the UK is leaving the EU’s single market and customs union. That means exporters will need to fill out customs declarations on hundreds of billions of pounds per year of trade. Brexit trade deal talks were held up for months over two main issues. Fishing: The two sides were split over two issues - quotas and access. In -, % of the fish in UK waters was caught by EU boats and % by UK boats. Britain wanted both more quota to catch its own fish, and ultimate control over who accesses the waters. Both sides agreed a five-and-a-half-year transition period before the UK has full sovereignty over its own waters. This was more than the three years originally demanded by the UK. Meanwhile the UK share of fish caught in its own waters will rise to reclaim % of fish currently caught by EU trawlers by . Originally the UK had demanded % of the EUaposs quotas in UK waters. Level playing field: This means how closely we follow EU rules in the future, to stop us undercutting businesses on the continent. The UK wanted to be free to set its own laws in areas like labour, environment, climate, and subsidies for businesses . But the EU originally demanded equivalence, with the UK mirroring EU rules in future. In the end, the EU won its demand for both sides to have a level playing field in which neither side will grant unfair subsidies or distort competition. But the deal stops short of the EUaposs original demands for the UK to mirror EU laws. Instead the PM said each side will be able “as sovereign equals” to take actionthe other side undercuts their industry - but this should only be done infrequently. The PM admitted the EU would be able to slap tarfs on UK exports and vice versathe UK is seen to undercut EU rules. But he insisted it would have to be “proportionate” and “subject to arbitration”."},{"url":null,"title":"heat maps show spread new","story":"NewsHeat maps show spread of new Covid iant - with sobering Christmas impact to comeNew heat maps show how the UKs Covid- infection rate doubled between December  and Christmas Eve, with London and South East the worst affected by the spread of a new iantmirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video terrying-heat-maps-show-spread-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

They were released as one of the Governmentaposs top scientic advisers warned on Wednesday that the sobering impact of household mixing during the Christmas is still to come as NHS hospitals in England currently treat a record number of virus patients. A further  deaths on Wednesday was the highest daily total of the second wave.Britainaposs coronavirus infection rate has doubled over the last two weeks, and regional rates are highest in London and the South East, where the new iant is fuelling a winter surge in cases. The average rolling seven-day infection rate for the UK on December  was  new cases per , people, but it had soared to  on Christmas Eve. Do you agree with the tier your local area is in  Let us know in the comments section below.    The percentage of people testing positive for the new iant is increasing in every region in England, with the sharpest increases seen in London, the South East and the East. Between December - the  weekly case rate  in England jumped  to  ., a % increase on the previous week. Some , patients have been admitted to hospital with Covid- in the past week, an % increase on the week before. Parts of Essex, Kent and London have the highest case rates in England, with Brentwood tops at . in the seven days to Christmas Day. The estimated number of people testing positive for Covid- in the community in England has also continued to rise. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said that at the start of the autumn around one in  people in England were testing positive for the virus, but that the number had increased to one in  at the point just before Christmas.He added that in areas including the east of England, the south of England and London, cases of the new coronavirus iant were increasing at a really very substantial rate indeed.Speaking alongside the Prime Minister at a Downing Street briefing, Prof Van-Tam said there was enormous concern that the new iant with its new transmissibility was spreading from the south to other parts of the country. Responding to the fact that % of England would be entering Tier  as of tomorrow, Prof Van-Tam said: Unfortunately it is a pretty grim and depressing picture at the moment.He added that the NHS had yet to see the impact of mixing during the festive period. The situation in the UK is precarious in many parts already, the South East and London, he said. It is almost certainly true that the NHS has not yet seen the impact of the infections that will have occurred during mixing on Christmas Day and that is also unfortunately rather sobering. Prof Van-Tam added that members of the public had just got to play your part from bringing us back from this very dangerous situation. Boris Johnson said the the UK must redouble its efforts to fight coronavirus. His comments came as an extra  million people in England were plunged into the toughest Tier  lockdown restrictions, and the Government U-turned on its back-to-school plans. On the day a vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca was approved to tackle Covid-, Mr Johnson said a new strain of the virus was surging across the country and immediate action was needed. He told the Downing Street briefing that the Oxford vaccine and one from Pfizer were being rolled out, adding: We are working as hard and as fast as we can to get the supplies to you.  But he said: We have to face the fact that weaposve got two big things happening at once in our fight against Covid - oneaposs working for us and oneaposs working against us. On the plus side, we have got two valid vaccines, and weaposre racing to get them out - and on the bad side there is a new strain of the virus which is spreading much faster and surging across the country. Referring to new tier allocations announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Mr Johnson said: At this critical moment, with the prospect of freedom within reach, weaposve got to redouble our efforts to contain the virus No-one regrets these measures more bitterly than I do, but we must take firm action now.

Confirmed just  hours before the transition period ends tomorrow night, it means tarfs will not be slapped on our £bn a year of trade with the continent. But there are still many holes and areas still to be worked out. And Labouraposs Keir Starmer said he was only backing the deal to avoid the disaster of crashing out with no deal at all. Boris Johnson was due to sign the deal itself in No at pm after it was signed by EU chiefs this morning, and airlted to Britain on one of the Queenaposs planes.The Queen, who is spending Christmas at Windsor Castle, is due to give Royal Assent at about midnight tonight after the deal passes through the House of Lords. How MPs voted on the Bill in general  Tory MPs and  Labour MPs backed the second reading of the EUBill.Tory Brexiteers and Labour leader Keir Starmer both voted for the Bill, despite the ,-page trade deal getting less than five hours of scrutiny in the Commons.Sir Keir slammed the thin deal but warned his own MPs: There’s only one choice today - which is to vote for implementing this deal, or to vote for no deal. Those who vote no are voting for no deal.” However, it was not enough to stop a Labour revolt. Three Labour MPs, Florence Eshalomi, Helen Hayes and Tonia Antoniazzi, quit frontbench roles to abstain on the deal - in other words, avoid backing it. Ms Hayes, who quit as a Shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: The Prime Minister’s preication and brinkmanship have resulted in the House of Commons being given just five hours to debate and scrutinise a  clause Bill and a , page Treaty.  That is nothing short of a national disgrace, a contempt for this Parliament and an insult to every citizen of the UK. Only one Labour MP, Bell Riberio-Addy, voted against, but  other Labour MPs abstained.The SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, Northern Irish DUP MPs and the Greensapos single representative also voted against.Search for how your MP voted "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt gets embarrassing telling","story":"NewsJeremy Hunt gets embarrassing telling off for his outfit at Commons debateJeremy Hunt had some questions for Matt Hancock after he announced more areas are being placed into Tier  Covid- restrictions - however Speaker Lindsay Hoyle jumped in to comment on the MPs lack of tiemirrorShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video jeremy-hunt-gets-told-not-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

But back in April schools were shut, next week primary schools are due to reopen. In September we came to regret allowing university students to go back en masse but some universities are going to start to go back from next week. Why in the middle of winter when the NHS is under such pressure, when we have a dangerous new strain of the virus are we taking such huge risks  Shouldnapost our entire focus for the entire eight to  weeks be on saving lives  However before Matt Hancock had a chance to reply, Speaker Lindsay Hoyle interrupted to remind Hunt about parliamentaposs dress code. Hunt was dressed in a smart blue shirt for the meeting, however he was not wearing a tie.  He said: Can I just remind members who are not in the Chambers that they should have the same dress code even though they are virtual. Itaposs only fair that we treat each other with the same respect. While the speakeraposs words were met by cheers in the Commons, people watching on TV were furious at him for bringing the issue up while discussing such a vital topic. One user wrote: So Jeremy Hunt was making a desperately important point about the level of risk involved in bringing schools and universities back on mass in January....and the Speaker feels it more important to pick him up on his dress code. Talk about tone deaf. Another added: Youaposve got to work really hard to make me side with Jeremy Hunt! Heaposs literally discussing le and death and Lindsay Hoyle, is worried about the dress code!A third commented: Cackled at Jeremy Hunt getting a telling off for not being in a suit and tie in his own home. Don’t get me wrong, I despise the man. But do we not think there’s a bit more going on than reinforcing a stupid dress code !Also, has he seen Boris Johnson  Hand the man a hairbrush!!

But from tomorrow, December , millions more will be given the stay at home order after , new coronavirus cases were reported in just one day yesterday, a new record. The new iant of coronavirus, believed to be up to % more transmissible than the early iant of the disease, prompted the government to introduce strict new restrictions for swathes of the country. Designed to slow the spread of the virus, the Tier Four restrictions closely match those of the national lockdown imposed on England in November. The fourth tier was established just before Christmas in order to stop the spread of the new iant in the south of England. Christmas bubbles were cancelled, and a Stay at Home order was set out in law, and now millions more will join the areas already living under tighter restrictions. Here are the latest rules, detailing what you can and canapost doyouaposre a Tier Four resident: Tier  rules The Tier  rules are very similar to the rules of the November national lockdown. All non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms and leisure centres, and other entertainment venuesmust close in Tier . Only essential shops are allowed to open, and a stay at home order has been put into law for Tier  residents. As in previous lockdowns there are exemptions -you need to leave your home for essential shopping, education, childcare, workand unlimited exercise. Outdoor sport can also take place. The public is advised not to leave or enter a Tier  area, and Tier  residents must not stay overnight anywhere other than their own home.

The Health Secretary said the approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca jab this morning means there will now eventually be enough doses for every Brit who wants the jab. The UK has ordered enough of the Oxford jab for million people, on top of enough of the Pfizer jab for million people. However, it will still take several months for the majority of the population to be vaccinated. Mr Hancock said the most vulnerable in the first phase, including all over-s, will be vaccinated by the Spring. But he would not put a date on it, or on when younger healthy Brits can start getting vaccinated against Covid-. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation will set out updated information on the priority list today, but Mr Hancock said the order will be exactly the same as with the Pfizer jab. The priority list puts care home residents, frontline health and care workers and over-s first, followed by younger pensioners, shielders, and under-s with health conditions like liver disease, diabetes or morbid obesity. He told BBC Breakfast: They have said the prioritisation in terms of what order people should be prioritised should be exactly the same as for the Pfizer vaccine, which is good news And that we should prioritise having as many people getting the first dose as possible.  Unlike the Pfizer jab, the Oxford jab can be stored at routine temperatures and the second dose only needs to be given after  weeks. That means the government can prioritise getting more people their first dose of the vaccine. The easier handling of the jab also means it can go to more care homes, which the government was accused of leaving behind in the vaccine rollout so far.  Mr Hancock said: “Once we’ve vaccinated all of them and the over-s, which is a signicant chunk of the population, then we will continue to vaccinate the under s - even though the likelihood of dying from the disease is much loweryou’re under the age of . “Because we’ve got enough of this vaccine on order to vaccinate the whole population. “We’ve got million doses on order - add that to the million [sic] doses of Pfizer and that’s enough for two doses for the entire population."},{"url":null,"title":"barclays close 65 more branches","story":"NewsBarclays announces plan to shut  more local branches - see full listEXCLUSIVE: Barclays has closed, or had plans to shut,  branches since  and the latest closures come despite the bank giant admitting some of those being axed have seen rising customer numbersmirrorShareCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsBarclays is to axe  more branches \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Keenan Latimer has been delivering papers to residents in Stamford, Lincolnshire seven days a week for the past two years. But after the -year-old was forced to self-isolate due to Covid cases at his school, the GCSE pupil was left devastated to be told not toto his morning round. Dad John says he is now looking into whether the family can sue Sutherland Way Stores for unfair dismissal after his son lost his job just for following Government guidelines.Schoolboy Keenan took  days off work in a month because of self-isolation rules issued by Bourne Grammar School following two breakouts of coronavirus cases.The teenager also missed two days due to a punctured bike tyre and John claims these are the only days he has taken off during the past two years. When he was contacted by his school telling him to start isolating for a third time just before Christmas, shop owner Neil Barlow terminated his employment. John, , has branded his sonaposs treatment as shameful and disgraceful as the only alternative would have been to flout coronavirus rules. Dad-of-three John, a factory worker, said: “He’s lost his job merely for following the guidelines and that’s not acceptable. In fact itaposs downright shameful.  If this was to happen to an adult in the workplace they would well be in their rights to take them to an employment tribunal. Iaposve been looking into the matter to seethis is something we can do, because in my book he has been unfairly dismissed. My son has been getting up early for them for the past two years. He isnapost work-shy and has done nothing wrong. Itaposs disgusting how he has been treated. Apart from missing a couple of days due to a punctured tyre, he has only missed two lots of  days days and both occasions were out of his control. What did they want him to do, go out there potentially endangering others by spreading the virus  He was told to self isolate because people he had been in contact with had the virus, so he is being punished for doing the sensible thing. Iaposm trying to teach him the value of hard work and right from wrong and then he loses his job for following the Government and NHS rules. His mother-in law and sister are both carers, so when he was self-isolating he was even locked away in his bedroom to protect them as well. We take his meals and leave them outside his room and he even goes to the bathroom in a face mask.He is a sensible lad, he hasnapost skived off to go and hang out on the streets - heaposs just done what his school have asked him to do.Keenan, who was getting up at .am on weekdays, and .am at weekends, earned £ a week and last Christmas picked up £ in tips.He had been saving some of the money to spend during a family holiday planned for next year. Keenan said: “Iaposd taken a couple of weeks off due to Covid cases at my school. I had an email telling me to self-isolate, so I did. I was told I had been in contact with a positive case, so I felt like I had no choice and was doing the right thing. I was told to self-isolate again by my school just before Christmas and when I got that message I rang work and left a voicemail. When they came back to me they said I had missed too much time. They just said we donapost need you any more and effectively that I was fired. Iaposm not sure what I was supposed to do dferently, it came as a bit of a shock. I had done my paper round as normal the day before and the next day I was sacked. Last Christmas I got about £ in tips and I obviously missed out on that this year. “I’m OK with it, but not OK. I won’t miss getting up early - but I will miss earning money. Neil Barlow, who has owned Sutherland Way Stores for  years, said Keenan had missed seven shts out of ten. He added: “Many times he didn’t turn up, which puts other people under pressure in the business because we don’t want to have disappointed customers.

On the eve of our departure, we asked for opinions from people in the most pro and anti-EU parts of the country. They were Cambridge, where one ward had the highest proportion of pro-EU voters, and Boston, Lincolnshire, which had the most Leave voters. CAMBRIDGE The university city is pro-EU and its Market Ward had the highest proportion of Remainers in the UK at .% Restaurateur Saoor Rahman feels uneasy for the future of his -month-old son Yusha in a post-Brexit world. His Raja Restaurant thrived after opening in  but is now, during a pandemic, struggling.  But the  year-old reveals it was straight after the Brexit vote in June  that income first dwindled.He says he noticed fewer languages spoken at his tables and says: “Cambridge is a very international, student city... Brexit put a lot of people off coming.” Sai’s parents immigrated from Bangladesh and he worries racism, or at least fear of immigration, fuelled Brexit. Teacher Yolanda Warwick agrees. Originally from Greece, she is emotional as she admits having encountered hostility herself since the vote. The -year-old is married to a British man, has two British children, and has lived in the UK for  years after studying at Manchester Univserity. Yet after the vote some pupils taunted her: “Where’s your accent from  You’re not from around here, you’re not British”. She says quietly: “That was a shock.” Dr Alasdair Parker, , a consultant paediatric neurologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, fears an exodus of European colleagues. He says: “In Britain we still massively under-train, we produce a quarter of the number we need in the NHS. “And there are some areas where we are totally reliant on EU immigration. “In Addenbrooke’s I see that in highly specialist roles, things like radiotherapy, radiology, we have very high-quality people coming from Spain, Portugal and Italy.” BOSTON, LINCS  Alan Clarke and we Jean were among the .% of locals who voted Leave, making the town the UK’s most pro-Brexit place. The -year-old plans to hoist a Union Jack in his garden tonight to mark Brexit. He says: “I’m % not racist, I don’t have a problem with people coming here.” But Alan, who runs a shop in Ingoldmells, hankers after a time when “people were proud to be British” and adds: “Make Britain Great Again, that’s not a bad idea.” Cerri Fletcher is still fervently anti-EU. The fancy dress shop owner, who came to England from Ireland as a baby, says: “Everyone’s fed up of the Iranians, the Turkish and the Romanians. They’re causing... grief and stabbings, killings and dodgy business around Boston.” Many point to Boston’s Tory mayor being of Moroccan-French heritage as proof that Boston is not anti-immigration. Mayor Anton Dani, , in the country for nine years and married to a Polish immigrant, says people don’t dislike foreigners, just their lack of integration.  He says: “There are people who have been living in Boston for the last ,  years and they can’t speak English.” But he thinks Brexit won’t alter immigration, saying: “People can still enter the country on a tourist visa... then overstay.” Polish financial advisor Iga Paczkowski, , says the referendum sparked hostility. She says: “It was quite painful. But over time people started being nice to us again.” People across the EU have been telling us what they think about our leaving. Amsterdam    Mick van Bemmel, , masters student I don’t understand. The pros do not weigh up against the cons. I am not worried about the future of the EU. All the years of negotiating have made it very clear it is not as easy as it may sound to leave. But it is not perfect yet...we have to look at long-term goals not short term gains. Berlin Stefan Jeka, , senior product manager I am concerned about possible changes within British society. If the negative impact of Brexit is getting severe, people with low income will be disproportionately affected. History told us more than once that this can lead to the rise of extremist views. Britain has made a mistake. Brexit is an experiment with a very uncertain outcome.

Sarah Jane McIntyre is past her period of self-isolation, but is still feeling the effects - a trip to the shops was so exhausting it left her shaking and drenched in sweat. The -year-old, from Belfast, has urged people to follow restrictions and said the symptoms she suffered were not like those commonly associated with Covid-.Health care worker Sarah Jane said she began with headaches so severe it was agony just keeping her eyes open and back pain like she was in labour, reports BelfastLive.Her warning comes after a sharp rise in positive cases in people aged - in Northern Ireland. No one understands, it is out there that the symptoms are a high temperature, cough and loss of smell and taste, but it has been so much more than that for me, she said. No one tells you how tired you will get, walking down the stairs is tough. I donapost think people realise how serious and contagious it is, I am still getting over it and I am on day . She said she is lucky she didnapost have to go to hospital and could remain at home with her children, despite the virus making her feel . Sarah Jane, who has asthma, ed from London on December  and said she felt tired but had put that down to lots of walking around the city. She then started to develop a headache, but again because it was not one of the stated symptoms she did not think she had contracted the virus.  But as the day went on she couldnapost keep her eyes open and even her skin began to hurt. I just thought, this isnapost normal, and I was freezing, I could not get heat into me. I didnapost want to risk seeing anyone so I went and got a test that afternoon. I did not expect to be positive, I thought it was a bit of a cold but the Saturday I found out I was positive. I balled my eyes out.Sarah Jane said her fingers and toes hurt like she had arthritis. She also said she could barely keep her eyes open and felt like an old woman getting out of bed.You feel like you are turning a corner with it then bang, you are back to square one but worse, the relapse is bad, she said. She forced herself to carry on as normal as she could on Christmas Eve for the sake of her children despite feeling nauseous the whole day. I did not lose my sense of taste or smell, my husband has Covid too and his symptoms are dferent to mine as well. On Christmas Day she suffered from diarrhea, vomiting and dizziness and said she nearly fainted in the bathroom. You feel like a pensioner, said Sarah Jane.

The police have warned flouters could face fines of up to £, with officers to be paying particularly close attention to areas experiencing the biggest infection surges. It comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that  million people would be plunged into Tier  from midnight yesterday. A total of  million people, or  percent of the population of England, will be living under the countryaposs toughest restrictions from Thursday as the whole of the UK battles a winter surge. Large parts of the North and Midlands joined London and the South East, while every area previously in Tier  was moved to Tier . Only the Isles of Scilly will be in Tier  come Thursday morning, with no areas in Tier , so bars and pubs across the land will have to be closed to customers. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said he was confident that the majority of people would respect the rules for their area. “Large gatherings and parties should not be happening,” he added. “We ask anyone thinking of attending or organising one not to.  Professor Stephen Powis, NHS Englandaposs national medical director, said staying at home and seeing in  within the rules will reduce infections and relieve pressure on hospitals. He told a Downing Street press conference: We know itaposs the end of the year, itaposs a time where people traditionally want to celebrate. But itaposs absolutely vital that this year, everybody continues to follow the guidance by staying at home and not mixing.  Prof Powis added: We can all play a part in fighting this terrible virus: stay at home, mark the New Year with just nearest and dearest within the rules. This action will reduce infections, relieve pressures on hospitals, and thataposs how everybody can help to save a le. Covid loves a crowd, so please leave the parties for later in the year. His call for restraint came as deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said the NHS had yet to see the impact of household mixing over Christmas.  He said the situation in the UK is precarious in many parts already and urged the public to play your part from bringing us back from this very dangerous situation. It is almost certainly true that the NHS has not yet seen the impact of the infections that will have occurred during mixing on Christmas Day and that is also unfortunately rather sobering, Prof Van-Tam said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson also urged people to follow the rules on December . He said: I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the New Year safely at home. That means not meeting up with friends or family indoors, unless theyaposre in the same household or support bubble, and avoiding large gatherings of any kind. The politan Police issued a warning to potential revellers to celebrate the New Year in the comfort of their own homes, not the homes of family and friends.  Commander Paul Brogden, who is leading this yearaposs operation, said: I would urge everyone to exercise caution, listen to government advice and celebrate the New Year in the comfort of their own homes, not the homes of family and friends. The public can expect to see officers deployed across the capital, supporting communities and focusing strongly on the few people intent on breaching and ignoring the guidance put in place to keep everyone safe. Officers will also be paying attention to parts of London that are experiencing the highest infection rates. As we have throughout the year,we become aware of planned events that breach Covid regulations, we will engage with organisers or venues to make them fully aware of the legal consequences and encourage them to cancel.

Mr Williamson told MPs in the Commons that the Government had to make an immediate adjustment to its plans for the reopening of schools in early January. He said: We must always act swtly when circumstances change. The evidence about the new Covid iant and rising infection rates have required some immediate adjustment to our plans for the new term. He added: The latest study we have from Public Health England is that Covid infections among children are triggered by changes in the community rate.  The study also says that the wider impact of school closures on childrenaposs development would be signicant. Iaposm quite clear that we must continue to do all we can to keep children in school.

The UK has ordered  million doses of the Oxford University vaccine, enough to vaccinate  million people.Writing exclusively in the Mirror, Mr Hancock said the Oxford vaccine is much better suited to reach care homes, as it doesnapost need to be stored at very cold temperatures, and he will put care home residents and staff at the front of the queue.It is the second vaccine to be approved by the UK medicines regular, after the Pfizer-BioNTech jab was given emergency use authorisation earlier this month.Will you get the Covid- vaccine  Let us know in the comments section below.But what is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and how is it dferent from the one developed by Pfizer  Here are the answers to some of the most popular questions. What is the plan for rolling out the Oxford vaccine  An initial , doses will be available from Monday. AstraZeneca has previously promised four million doses this year so these are likely to be available in the next few weeks. From Monday the Oxford jab will be given along with the Pfizer version at  hospitals and  clinics. They will also be sent into care homes and within days be administered to the elderly, unwell and care workers.  Why is there now a longer delay been doses  Trial data suggested a half dose followed by a full dose was % effective compared to the % provided by two full doses. Health authorities requested more detail and decided that the % group fared better because the doses were also given further apart. So they have now approved two full doses at an interval of up to three months. Can we be sure it is safe after such a quick turnaround  British regulators have been studying clinical trial data since the September. The US and EU are only now starting to analyse results. The UK is set to become the first major country protected by vaccination.  How effective is it  Regulators say a single full dose is % effective after three weeks and lasts up to three months. A second full dose then ups effectiveness to % and provides lasting protection. What about the Pfizer vaccine  Until now two doses had to be given within  days. But now regulators have allowed the second dose to be delayed. Pfizer says this needs to be monitored as their trial data does not show immunity after just one dose lasts longer than  days. Would I be better off with Pfizer  Trials concluded it was % effective. However experts insist results between dferent vaccines should not be compared as they were done under dferent circumstances. Vaccines are usually approvedthey are shown to be safe and more than % effective. Even though a small number of vaccinated participants got Covid, both vaccines prevented severe symptoms. How do they decide who gets the vaccine  The NHS will decide who gets offered which jab based on what is logistically best to get the most people vaccinated. Care home\u2028residents are likely to get the Oxford vaccine whereas those being vaccinated at hospitals – where they have ultra cold storage – may get the Pfizer jab.  Can I choose which I get  No. This will be a clinical decision  based on the advice of the Government’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Both vaccines are suitable for all priority groups. Can everyone get it  The Oxford jab is approved for everyone over . Previous precautionary advice for pregnant women to avoid vaccinations was amended so that it can be given to those who are at particular risk from Covid. People with allergies can now receive a vaccination unless they are allergic to any of its ingredients. Who gets it first  Age is the biggest factor. There are around  million people deemed vulnerable including all over-s. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the Chief Medical Officers in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland decide on priority. It starts with elderly care home residents in the first \u2028group, followed by all over-s as \u2028well as health and social care  workers in the second. It then drops down by five-year age groups however those with underlying health conditions are higher in the priority ranking.

A study of , adults with a physical disability or mental health condition found  per cent have felt lonely while  per cent have suffered depression. And  per cent said the pandemic has left them feeling isolated. But  per cent went as far as to say they felt people with a disability had been forgotten about during the pandemic. And three quartersbelieve those living without a disability donapost understand how dficult it has been for them during the pandemic and lockdown. The survey examined how the day-to-day tasks many take for granted have caused issues for people with a disability during the Covid crisis. Almost halfhave found using public transport a more dficult and stressful experience, while  per cent have struggled to attend a non-Covid related medical appointment. And  per cent of respondents were unable to get to the shop to top up their prepay gas or electricity meter.  Paralympian, TV presenter and author Ade Adepitan, MBE, is working with Smart Energy GB, which commissioned the research to highlight the benefits of smart meters to disabled and vulnerable people. I have had a few teammates on my basketball team and the basketball league and training sessions are their only form of social interaction. As soon as the lockdown hit, the basketball was cancelled and all training was stopped. I was shocked when I spoke to one of the guys on the team and he said he had spent almost eight weeks without speaking to anybody, stuck at home and the only person he spoke to was the cashier at his local supermarket once a week when he went shopping.  The mental toll that would take on someone is huge and itaposs been extremely dficult for everyone during lockdown but itaposs been felt even more acutely by people with disabilities. The OnePoll research for Smart Energy GB revealed seven in  have felt more anxious about trips to the supermarket and other shops than ever before. And a third of people living with a disability have been unable to buy groceries at some stage during the pandemic - because they couldnapost get to the shops. Dan Brooke, CEO of Smart Energy GB, added: Leaposs tough for everyone right now and disabled people and vulnerable people are being hit especially hard by the impact of COVID-. Itaposs imperative that help and support is available to those who need it most, however big or small the challenge.

The four UK Chief Medical Officers said prioritising the first doses for as many people as possible on the priority list will protect the greatest number of at risk people overall in the shortest possible time. The makers of the Oxford University  AstraZeneca jab aim to deliver  million doses a week - meaning  million people in the UK could be vaccinated by Easter. For both the Oxford and Pfizer coronavirus vaccines, data demonstrates that better protection comes when a second dose is administered, both offer considerable immunity after a single dose, at least in the short term. A second dose completes the course and is likely to be important for longer term protection, joint clinical advice from the four UK Chief Medical Officers says. Partial immunity should be achieved  days after the first dose of the vaccine, experts believe. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas recommended that as many people on the JCVI priority list as possible should be offered a first vaccine dose as the initial priority. They have advised that the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine may be given between  to  weeks following the first dose, and that the second dose of the AstraZenecavaccine may be given between  to  weeks following the first dose. The UK has ordered enough of the Oxford jab for million people, on top of enough of the Pfizer jab for million people. Mr Hancock said the most vulnerable in the first phase, including all over-s, will be vaccinated by the Spring. If the aim of million vaccinations a week is fulfilled,  million could have had the jab by Easter. AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot told BBC Radio aposs Today programme deliveries will be ramped up very rapidly in the first and second week of January. He added: The vaccination will start next week and we will get to one million a week and beyond that very rapidly. We can go to two million. In January we will already possibly be vaccinating several million people and by the end of the first quarter we are going to be in the tens of millions already. Asked whether two million vaccinations per week was possible, Mr Hancock told Times Radio: Thataposs absolutely deliverable by the NHS. The clinical risk priority order for deployment of the vaccines remains unchanged and applies to both vaccines.  A statement from the UKaposs four Chief Medical Officers said: [We] agree with JCVI that at this stage of the pandemic prioritising the first doses of vaccine for as many people as possible on the priority list will protect the greatest number of at risk people overall in the shortest possible time and will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality, severe disease and hospitalisations and in protecting the NHS and equivalent health services. Operationally this will mean that second doses of both vaccines will be administered towards the end of the recommended vaccine dosing schedule of  weeks. This will maximise the number of people getting vaccine and therefore receiving protection in the next  weeks. Dr June Raine, Chief Executive of the MHRA, Professor Sir Munir Pirmohamed, Chair of Commission on Human Medicine Expert Working Group, and Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair of JCVI, have held a press briefing to discuss this morning’s announcement that the Oxford University Astra Zeneca Covid- vaccine has been approved for use by the UK. Professor Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chairman of the Commission on Human Medicines expert working group on Covid- vaccines, said: What we are approving is that two standard doses should be given. They should be given at an interval of between four to  weeks. We also looked at the half-dose regimen, which has been publicised quite widely, but we felt that the results were not borne out by the full analysis. Weaposve come to the decision of an interval of between four to  weeks, based on the data that was presented to us.  Because of the design of the trial, some people got second doses at dferent time intervals. This allowed an analysis of the effectiveness of the vaccineyou were to be able to delay between four to  weeks. This showed that the effectiveness was high, up to %, when there was a three-month interval between the first and second doses, which is the reason for our recommendation. Professor Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chairman of the Commission on Human Medicines expert working group on Covid- vaccines, said the commission looked at data in all age groups, particularly in the elderly. He said: It is important to note that the vaccine does not protect immediately. You have to wait until day  before you get partial immunity after the first dose and so it is really important that people continue to follow all the government guidelines for your area of the country. We obviously also looked at the safety as well and the Commission on Human Medicines concluded that the safety profile of this vaccine is broadly similar to other vaccines.  Dr Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, also said the dose interval for the Pfizer vaccine has been increased from  days after the first dose to at least  days. She added: So this allows for a potentially longer interval, compared with the previous advice that was  days. And the conditions for use of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine stress that this is in accordance with national guidance.

The green light for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in such a short time is a tribute to the brilliance and ingenuity of our scientists. It is now imperative that the Government ensures the rollout is efficient and fast. Vaccination can save lives, reunite families and start to get le back to normal. So the approval of a second vaccine could not have come at a more needed time. The second wave of the virus is sweeping through the country at an unprecedented rate. Millions more people in England were today placed under tougher Covid restrictions – a national lockdown in all but name. Many hospitals, despite the valiant work of NHS staff, are struggling to cope. The daily death toll is now the highest since April and it is sadly inevitable that the number of Covid’s victims will rise still further. While we wait for the rollout of the vaccine, there can be no let-up in the provision of protective kit, oxygen supplies and testing. Vaccines are a promise of a brighter tomorrow but there is no disguising the darkness of the time before that dawn.  Deal is dodgy AFTER nearly five years of wrangling, the Brexit deal was rushed through the Commons in less than five hours. While most people will be relieved we are leaving with a deal, the agreement is far from the triumph claimed by Boris Johnson. If the Government were confident it had delivered the best possible deal, it would have allowed MPs more time to debate it. The fact that they did not suggests that they have something to hide.

The high school student, from Tinley Park, near Chicago, US, was otherwise healthy but the virus ate her through, leading to a brain bleed and kidney deterioration, according to her parents Deborah and Donald. A few days before Christmas, Sarah began to suffer with mild cold-like symptoms but things quickly escalated and her mum took her for a test on December , which came back positive. Over the next three days the Lincoln-Way East High School student continued to worsen, with vomiting, chills and body aches, before she was taken to Silver Cross Hospital on December .She was subsequently airlted to University of Chicago Medical Center where she died on Boxing Day, reports the Chicago Tribune. Deborah told WLS-TV : She went into cardiac arrest, she had a brain bleed, it was deteriorating her kidneys, it just ate her through. No parent should ever have to watch their child go through that. Nobody. I know she fought because one of the last times I was able to talk to her on the phone, they were taking her from the regular room to ICU and she said aposI am going to be OK, mom,apos and that was the last thing, Deborah added.

Ripe for renovation, the estate agency Realtor urges potential buyers to “bring your own ideas on what this ft x ft wing could be!”. Built in , the main house served as the jailer’s residence with lags sent to the attached former Essex County Jail until . With its address on Courthouse Drive, close to the village green, there’s plenty of prison history in the walls of the , sq ft property. Real estate agent Jenner Allen told the Daily Mail that while the jail is “fully intact” it has deteriorated and needs work.  With its creepy, cobweb-covered barred doors that run floor-to-ceiling, dusty toilets and sinks, and exposed plaster where the paint has chipped off the walls, it’s no renovation for the faint-hearted. “There are some historic things— like the old brick— that wouldnapost be able to be taken out, but somebody could take out the bars and turn it into living space,” said Allen. “It would be great to see somebody buy it that would want to create something out of the jail. Iaposd love to find a buyer that would be able to bring the jail back so itaposs a usable space again.”  The dormer over the jail has already been repaired, so that’s the first step of the renovation complete. But set in almost an acre of idyllic gardens, surrounded by forests and mountains, the house has plenty of other charms. A replica antique cook stove takes pride of place in the updated kitchen, with its large island and modern appliances.

The threesome say they even want to have children together as they start building a le. Dino De Souza and Saulo Gomes, , both from Brazil, first met Olga, , from Bélarus, at a bar during a holiday in Barcelona on August , last year. The friends were both captivated by Olga, who was hanging out at the venue with a group of friends, and each wanted to ask her out. Torn on how to resolve the situation without causing issues with their friendship, both men approached the young woman – and eventually, the trio began going on dates together. Dino and Saulo both fell head over heels with Olga, but they had never planned to become a throuple. Dino,  said: “Saulo and I arrived in Barcelona and went directly to a bar to see the Champions League game which was showing that night. “We entered the bar and Olga was there with a group of friends. “We approached her and we invited her to go and get a drink with us, and that was where our beautul story began. “For us, it is not a question of being in a relationship with three people. “Itaposs a question of chemistry, we happened to be connected. The chemistry was so strong that we are impressed to know what the other is thinking or feeling. “I would like to be able to describe what we feel, but we do not have adjectives to describe this feeling.”  Having dated for nearly a year and a half, Dino, Saulo and Olga travel, go to restaurants and go on dates just like a typical couple would, but as a trio. At first, the throuple received shocked reactions from friends and family about their relationship, as their loved ones struggled to understand it. Despite the initial backlash, the trio did their best to explain their situation calmly and their friends and family are now supportive. They still get confused looks and negative comments from people in public – but choose to ignore these and focus on their relationship instead. Dino said: “In the beginning, we received many shocking messages from friends and family trying to understand what was happening.  “We have been calm, explaining to them what we feel for Olga and that we have not changed as people, but instead have grown from this relationship. “We donapost get a lot of comments but we get a lot of confused looks from people. “When they have an opportunity to get to know us and talk, they completely change the way they were thinking about our relationship. “They get surprised and change negative opinions that they had before. “We are very mature and philosophical about le. We always try to stay positive and do not waste our energy with negative things. “We also donapost give a f**k what people think about us!” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/07/240ff779-831c-4c24-9094-22c5d639e65b.jpg ","title":"2020 review the political year that was","story":"If a week is a long time in politics, then  months is a proverbial eternity.In no year has this felt more apparent than . From Boris to Nicola, McPake to Mellon, Mum, Dad, Holyrood and Hollywood, you will scarcely find anyone who does not want to see the year  AD consigned to the history books.So, with  hindsight , let#s look back at the year that was, our new normal.Brexit, after almost four years of foul-ups, obfuscations, deals, no-deals, general electionsand all-round uncertainty, did, at least for a short while in January, seem to be nearing its unnatural end.The UK officially left the EU on January , before entering a transition period that kept everything much the same for the rest of the year.

Mullen took a place on the bench.After multiple pitch inspections, the officials deemed the surface playable shortly before kick-off.A minute#s silence was held in remembrance of three former Dees who passed away this week in Davie Sneddon, Chic McLelland and Jim McLean.Dundee went close early on through a Charlie Adam header but they fell behind after just  minutes.In the season of giving, Dark Blues right-back Christie Elliott was in a generous mood as his defensive error fell perfectly for Wasps midfielder Steven Hetherington.He made no mistake in finding the bottom corner.From that point it was largely attack against defence with the home side doing all the pressing.And they had a golden chance to level things up on  minutes when Osman Sow went through on goal.McDaid was the creator with a fine reverse pass sending the Swede through but he hit goalie Reece Willison with his finish.Paul McGowan fired a -yarder over the bar as Dundee struggled to open up the resolute Alloa defence and went in at the break a goal behind.They struck, though, straight after half-time with that man Sow on target once more.McGowan set Elliott free down the right and his cross was missed by everyone before falling to Sow at the back post. The goalkeeper beat the ball out but the linesman immediately flagged to give the striker his fth goal in three games.Minutes later a big shout went up from the Alloa players as Liam Buchanan went down in the area but the referee waved play on.On  minutes, Dundee had the vital lead. Once more Adam was the creator, sending in a deep corner and finding Liam Fontaine at the far post to volley home.And they had the security of a third with  minutes left on the clock as Jordan McGhee sent through Sow once more and this time the striker slotted the ball under the goalkeeper.Substitute Danny Mullen had a chance to add gloss to the scoreline in the closing stages but fired wide.As the match wound down there was concern for the Dark Blues however as Adam limped off in stoppage time clutching the thigh that has caused him trouble in recent weeks.At the full-time whistle, Dundee moved up to third thanks to Raith#s surprise home defeat to Queen of the South ahead of the home clash with leaders Hearts.Dundee XI: Hamilton, Elliott, Ashcroft, Fontaine, Marshall, Byrne, McGhee, Adam , McDaid , McGowan , Sow.Subs not used: Ferrie, Kerr, Forster, Anderson.Alloa XI: Willison, Cawley, Robertson, Graham, Jamieson, Dick , O#Donnell , Hetherington, Grant, Buchanan , Murray.Subs not used: Wilson, Lynch, Williamson, Evans.Referee: Steven ReidNewsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto-renew annually at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It is governed by regulations that decide what countries can participate.#Erasmus includes Norway, Iceland etc, and also states in the enlargement process like Serbia and Turkey, and it is open to neighbourhood countries as well.#But then, of course, we have the domestic issue of having the competence to enter into an international legal agreement which the UK has, but Scotland doesn#t.#So that#s domestic problem that would need to be overcome somehow.#I can#t really see the UK Government doing that because the new scheme that they#ve launched, the Turing scheme, they#ve made a point that it is UK wide. Even though, of course, education is devolved.#Prof Cardwell notes the Erasmus scheme is more than just pounds generated for the economy.On top of the evidence showing students tend to achieve better degrees, there are several #unquantiable# elements that are brought by exchange programmes, including establishing institutions overseas.He added: #Traditionally the UK as a whole has received more incoming Erasmus students than we sent out. Partly that was for linguistic reasons, but also the way in which our degrees are structured.#Having students from other European countries has led to a greater level of ersity, at minimal or no cost to the universities and with much wider benefits for society in terms of student spending#And most Erasmus students across will have a great experience and go back as ambassadors for Scotland or the UK. So in terms of teaching and research, it helps to solidy many of these links, which cannot easily be quantied.#We can quanty the numbers going in and out and we can quanty our costs a little bit, but we can#t take into account just how important it#s been for students to get to know Scotland, to get to know wherever they are, wherever they have been and either stay and contribute to the economy through working or, once they go back, to either convince others to come — perhaps to do a masters degree — or to be informal ambassadors in other ways, and that#s much more dficult to quanty.#More than £ million will be spent on the post-Brexit replacement of the Erasmus exchange programme for UK students next year, the UK Government announced.The Turing scheme — named after Bletchley Park cryptoanalyst Alan Turing — will provide funding for around , students to go on placements around the world from September.Universities UK and Universities Scotland, which represent higher and further education bodies, did welcome the announcement of a replacement scheme.But Prof Cardwell points out bonds between universities take time to set up and leaves more questions left unanswered than before.#One of the reasons I#m sceptical of how quickly it can be set up is that Erasmus has evolved over  years,# he added.#Institutional relationships which form the basis of an exchange take a long time to set up.#Usuallywe#re talking about the next academic year, we would normally be selecting students and preparing them just after Christmas to go in the summer # especiallyit was somewhere like Australia, which will start in July.#To set up a new scheme, get institutions to bid for the money and find out who#s going to operate it— is it going to be the British Council or is it going to be central government #How#s that going to work  Where is the money going to go — is it going to go to universities  How do they distribute it  And what#s crucial about it is: who#s at the centre of this  The students.#We know how Erasmus works, students get inidual grants, which comes from a national agency, which is distributed from the EU budget.One hundred million pounds sounds a lot but it probably wouldn#t go that far.#Professor Paul CardwellProf Cardwell says the money being allocated to the new Turing scheme by the UK Government will be stretched thin to cover the anticipated , students each year.#With a budget of £ million, a lot of people have done the calculation of that being £, each, which isn#t a lotdoesn#t take into account any of the institutional costs#What#s important about this is that in Erasmus, and other exchanges outside Europe, they usually work on the basis of a fee waiver.#A lot of noises are being made, particularly by Conservative MPs, saying #students will be able to go to elite US universities#.#Those universities are not necessarily just going to let in lots of UK students and let them off paying the fees just because they#re getting a scholarship from the UK Government.#But there#s no way I can see how the Turing scheme would allow for tuition fees, especially not somewhere as expensive as the US. And that means the budget would very much disappear.#One hundred million pounds sounds a lot but it probably wouldn#t go that far.#He continued: #If you#re trying to, as the stated aim of the Turing scheme is, help the most disadvantaged in society, how do you reach those #How do you get those students to be able to participate, especially when you#re not really able to guarantee whether they are going to be able to benefit from a programme that is going to not leave them financially worse off.#Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto-renew annually at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He even travelled to all the European away games through the s.One day, he’d seen something he didn’t like happening on the park, and since there were no online fan forums or anything like that, he picked up a pen and wrote a letter to Jim McLean.He was having a moan, basically!Lo and behold, a few days later, there was a knock on our front door – and there was Jim.I remember my mum taking me away into the kitchen while Jim went with my dad into the living room for a chat about the letter.It wasn’t a quick chat, either. When my dad tells the story now, he says they were in there for a good hour, just talking about my dad’s complaint, then about football.When you think about that now, it seems unbelievable.Would a manager today do the same thing  There’s absolutely no chance.For me, that story shows just how invested Jim McLean was in football – but also in Dundee United.He cared about the club. And when fans thought he wasn’t doing his job correctly, it hurt him, because he felt he had a responsibility to them.That’s a big part of what made him a great manager.And there can be no argument # he was truly a great.Sir Alex Ferguson described Jim Mclean as his biggest rival in football following Jim’s death.Never mind Jose Mourinho, never mind Arsene Wenger, never mind Rafa Benitez# Jim McLean was the man who gave Sir Alex the biggest challenge.That says it all. And it doesn’t surprise me at all.I’ve spoken to plenty of guys who played under Jim at Tannadice and they all say he was so ahead of his time.We’ve all heard the stories of how he was introducing elements of sports science into how he worked at United before sports science was even really a thing.That came from having a first class football head on his shoulders.He knew what it took to improve footballers.He also knew the value of loyalty.If there was a manager today who led United to two or three trophies in four or five years, he’d be away.Jim McLean had chances to leave United # and they would have made him a wealthy man # but he never took them.Now, his name is probably the first thing people think of when they think of Dundee United.That’s entirely deserved. And when his statue is finally unveiled, it will be an entirely fitting tribute.Speak to Hearts fans about Osman Sow and they’ll tell you he was dynamite at Tynecastle.So let’s hope the Swede’s hat-trick at Queen of the South was a sign of him exploding into le as a Dundee player.It was a risk for James McPake to sign Sow.Everybody knows there’s a player in there, but injuries have undoubtedly hampered him.They certainly did at Dundee United, where fans saw nothing close to the best of him.The temptation, when he signed up at Dens Park, was to suspect it would be a similar story.But he has played plenty of games # and four goals from his last two suggest he’s warming up.If he can get anywhere near the level of play he regularly touched at Hearts, Dundee will have a guy capable of firing them up the table on their hands.And in Charlie Adam, he will have the Championship’s most able attacking midfielder in support.Charlie’s a player whose efforts in recent weeks have been incredible.He has been going through a horrible time off the pitch with the death of his mum.But his performances in dark blue have been as good #not better # than ever.That says so much, not just about his ability, but about his mentality.He is an example to us all.This weekend’s Old Firm clash is absolutely massive.As far as I’m concerned,Rangers win, you can hand them the title.Celtic are already so far behind they need to win the remaining Old Firm games to have any chance.Defeat in this one would leave them with a mountain to climb.But I hope it doesn’t pan out like that.I want to see Celtic doing their bit to keep the title race going.I like a bit of drama at the top end of the Premiership.

There was a real desert rat on the palm of my hand.#Then, on another occasion, I woke up to find a rat chewing my ear!”Two years later, after he had been re-deployed at Monte Cassino, he was badly burned and spent eight weeks in an Italian hospital, where he found himself becoming the driver for Hugo Baring of Baring Bank fame.A larger-than-le character, who became friends with former enemies, and enjoyed a #wee whisky# well into his th decade, Jimmy was loved by all who knew him.She was just  when she was recruited from Aberdeen University to join the crucial work which was being done at Bletchley Park during the Second World War.And former codebreaker Helene Aldwinkle was presented with the insignia of Knight of the Legion d’Honneur – France’s highest civilian and military honour # just a year before her death in April this year aged .Back in , the young Helene Taylor left Scotland for only the third time in her le, travelled to a place she did not know and lived with complete strangers, to do work which she could not even be told about until after she had arrived.She was chosen by a senior codebreaker, Stuart Milner-Barry, to work in Bletchley Park’s Hut , the department tasked with deciphering Enigma messages sent by the German army and air force.In doing so, she played an important part in cementing the British-American intelligence sharing agreement which endures to this day.From  until the end of the war, this resilient inidual worked in a section of Hut  called the Quiet Room, where she identied the ious Enigma radio networks, and analysed radio signals’ preambles and sign-offs.Hut  played a crucial role in the lead-up to the Normandy invasion and, more than  years later, the French Republic honoured Mrs Aldwinkle for her contribution towards D-Day and the liberation of France.There was a time in  when the outcome of the Second World War hung in the balance.But Aberdeen’s Eric Johnston was one of the people who made a dference in the conflict and moved from being a bank employee to winning the Legion D’honneur and being a pivotal figure during the D-Day landings in Normandy in .Mr Johnston left his parents, George and Isabella, disconsolate when he decided to become a tank driver and a reconnaissance trooper with the Royal Dragoon Guards.He became one of the heroic figures in the preparation and implementation of D-Day, although Mr Johnston, who died in January, aged , was very critical of the manner in which hundreds of American troops died on their way to Normandy.A fiercely single-minded character, he decided to record his memoirs in a book – which he wrote in his s – called Reflections of a Tank Trooper .The last word was typical of his approach to dealing with any setbacks. As he told me during one of our meetings at his Aberdeen home: “I was at a reunion and I mentioned some of my war memories to a friend.“He said: ‘You better put them down on paper. You won’t be around forever, you know’.#So I went home and started writing the book the very next day.”Mr Johnston – a keen mountaineer who also loved rugby – was the subject of one of  portraits, commissioned by Prince Charles, to honour D-Day veterans in .He attended the unveiling of the paintings of veterans at Buckingham Palace with his daughters, Helen and Sheila, and met the Duchess of Cornwall.Hamish MacInnes, one of the world’s most famous mountaineers, died at his Highland home in November, aged .The remarkable Scot, with the nickname The Fox of Glencoe, who was climbing on the Matterhorn as a teenager and was involved in Sir Chris Bonington’s successful Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition in , was a pioneering figure widely regarded as the father of modern mountain rescue.His inventive mind was the catalyst for a number of initiatives such as the Search and Rescue Dog Association and the Avalanche Information Service.He made an attempt to climb Everest in  and invented the first all-metal ice-axe and a lightweight stretcher, widely used in mountain and helicopter rescue.During his far-travelled and eventful le, he worked with some of Hollywood’s biggest names, including Clint Eastwood, Sir Sean Connery and Robert De Niro on such films as The Eiger Sanction, Five Days One Summer and the Mission.A pioneering free spirit, he built his own motor car when he was just . There were few problems which confronted him, on or off the peaks, whch he could not negotiate. Or, at least, not until the latter stages of his le.In , Mr MacInnes suffered a urinary tract infection which left him suffering from delirium and he was ‘sectioned’ into a psychiatric hospital in the Scottish Highlands.Eventually, after recovering from the illness, he was left with no memory of his former le but rallied from adversity and made a poignantto the spotlight.As some colleagues said, the mountains will seem emptier without him.He was the prolic north-east journalist who ghosted a newspaper column for the legendary Muhammad Ali, secured a world exclusive interview with Charlie Chaplin in Banchory and was friends with Bing Crosby.Jack Webster, who died in March aged , was told early in his le after being diagnosed with a leaking heart valve that he should settle for a job as a bank clerk.But the Maud-born farmer’s son proved the doctors wrong and spent the next  years defying obstacles – from overcoming a stammer to be crowned UK Speaker of the Year in , to trumping his rivals by gaining access to all manner of international figures, including Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren, Ginger Rodgers, Pele and George Best.He also landed a genuine scoop with comic great Chaplin at the Tivoli in Aberdeen.Mr Webster’s journalistic career, honed on a passion for Sunset Song author, Lewis Grassic Gibbon, started at the Turrf Advertiser before  years at the Press and Journal. He then moved to Glasgow and joined the .While there, he became the Scottish equivalent of Michael Parkinson, securing interviews with many of the biggest stars of stage and screen.One of his sons, Geoff recalled: “Dad was given a roving role and he managed to set up some remarkable meetings with the likes of Chaplin and Ali.“He learned that the former – who had refused to speak to journalists after being hounded out of America – was staying in Banchory. So he checked into the same hotel, got talking to the great man and askedhe would like to revisit the Tivoli, where Chaplin has performed early in his career. He said yes.#There were no airs and graces about Buff Hardie, even as he was creating the mystical world of Auchterturra and enjoying success with Scotland the What He and his colleagues, Steve Robertson and George Donald, may have become showbusiness luminaries and been showered with accolades including the rarely-bestowed Freedom of Aberdeen in , but Mr Hardie, who died earlier this month aged , never forgot his roots or growing up at  Hilton Road in his home city.In his “real” job, Mr Hardie, who advanced from a north-east childhood to graduating from Cambridge University, expressed his desire to help others and for many years, he was the secretary of the former Grampian Health Board which, among other things, helped design the current Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.However, his le was transformed when the Scotland the What  show earned glowing reviews from the critics, was lapped by an international audience, and they subsequently became successful performers whenever they unveiled their latest work at their spiritual home, His Majesty’s Theatre, in Aberdeen.He told the Press and Journal, just a few weeks before his death: “We performed at the Fringe in a small church hall with an hour-long show and our pitch was: ‘Three men, two chairs, one piano – and the promise that you won’t leave without laughing. One of the first people who saw us was Neville Garden, who had just sat through four hours of Wagner at the Usher Hall and was ready to laugh at anything – which he did.“The next day, his crit in the paper declared he had just seen ‘the funniest show in the festival’ and the whole thing took off. We never looked back.”Thereafter, the group devised new sketches and musical numbers every two years, which they unveiled to packed audiences at HMT, before taking their routines on tour around Scotland and to other parts of the world.And although their last hurrah was in November , they received the Freedom of Aberdeen from the city council for “their services to the fine arts, the Doric language and North East of Scotland culture and, above all, for makin’ a’body laugh.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\":This offer will auto-renew annually at the price of  ua. you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

The moon lit up the landscape and the whole earth breathed peace.The only sound was the quiet lapping as the ocean rolled its waves once again to the shore. The darkness was penetrated by billions of pinpricks of light, reminding me that light has the last word.We are waiting for the lighter nights. We are waiting for the ening days. We are waiting for the light. We are waiting for the light, and for the le light.We wait quietly in a cosmic silence. Waiting can bring peace as we find God’s presence in the present. Waiting can bring hope as we know the light will come.But it’s hard to stop and wait it’s not easy to pause and ponder it’s dficult to take time at this time. We’re busy with the bargains and not so bothered about the baby.We’re busy with the tinsel but haven’t time for the truth. We’re busy with the mince pies and we will get round to the manger.We’re busy trying to fix the tree lights but have forgotten about theWe’re busy with the cards but have pushed away the crib. We’re busy – it is Christmas after all.We just don’t have time right now. We will make time for God when we’re less busy.

There are plainly the financial resources to deal with this.It is an inexcusable dereliction of duty on their part and will not be forgiven or forgotten by people whose jobs and livelihoods are being threatened by this ongoing crisis.Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,I am delighted that the Scottish Government is taking forward my campaign for greater fire safety precautions in social housing.Guidance is now going out to the building industry, ahead of installing fire sprinklers in all new social housing with new regulations coming into effect next year.The sprinklers will be a requirement in new flats, maisonettes and larger multi-occupancy dwellings, including where care is provided.Fire sprinklers have  proved time and time again to be effective in the fight against fire and I know that this move will save lives.There has always been strong backing for these plans from the public, the industry and other MSPs, especially in the light of the Grenfell Tower disaster.I would still like retro-fitting sprinklers in older properties to be considered and, although that is my longer term hope, I understand the problems this would pose.I am delighted this is coming in before I retire as an MSP at next year#s election – what better than a le-saving #present# at Christmas David Stewart MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,Can I please, through the columns of the Argyllshire Advertiser, say a very big thank you to all the wonderful staff and their manager Nan Anderson at the council#s Ardfenaig care home in Ardrishaig.These people have, since the lockdown and well before that, given those in their care love and affection that is second to none.On a daily basis they put themselves in harm#s way, to the benefit of not only the residents but also the relatives of the residents, and may I personally say they do it in a professional and loving way.On behalf of those in your care, especially those who cannot say it for themselves, #Thank you and a very merry Christmas to you all#.Leonard McNeill, MinardSir,I congratulate the Scottish Government on its recent commitment to a bill that will give the role of local government legal status in Scotland.The European Charter of Local Self-Government Bill has been proposed and fought for by Andy Wightman of the Green Party. It aims to incorporate the European Charter of Local Self-Government into Scots law, setting out certain rights for councils and protecting them from centralisation.It’s been strongly supported by local government body COSLA, whose president, Councillor Alison Evison said: #This is a good day for democracy in Scotland. It is a good day for our communities.# It’s also a good day for our hard-pressed local government.Here in Argyll and Bute, I think we recognise the absolute necessity of so many of the services provided by local government for our day-to-day wellbeing.We also recognise the increasingly challenging responsibility involved in the delivery of those services, not least in the face of Covid- and the climate emergency, which both have tested us all this year.Our comings and goings have been adversely affected by both these #events#, as our social relations are constrained by the first, and our movements, our access and connectivity by the unprecedented scale of the A Rest and be Thankful landslides.Andy Wightman’s Bill,enacted, will give people a stronger voice in the conduct of their  affairs, and we will increasingly need that stronger voice to advocate for our present and our future in Argyll and Bute.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,The much-loved Erskine Tree of Honour was dedicated and lit in fine style last week.Every year the Tree of Honour dedications lead us into the festive season.This year, in spite of the pandemic, we embrace the opportunity to remember those who will be missing from our lives this Christmas.

The rules and regulations put in place to control coronavirus have put paid to that tradition for this year.#But that does not mean that communities cannot sing Christmas carols, even while everyone keeps their distance.#A creative way around this has been the suggestion that on Sunday December  at pm, people should gather on their doorsteps, or by a window, and sing out together. Just as communities rallied to thank NHS and other key-workers by standing in their doorways to make a joyful noise on Thursday evenings, the idea is that we can all join together to sing in Christmas – to be heralds,not angels!#Five carols are going to be sung nationwide that night: O Come all ye Faithful, Still the Night, Once in Royal David’s City, Away in a Manger and Hark the Herald Angels Sing – and the Ardrishaig community is being encouraged to join in.#Carol sheets have been made available at the church, in Peter Law  Sons, Morna#s Flower Shop and McColl#s.#It has also been suggested thatpeople wanted they could leave a donation for Ardrishaig Social Club’s Pensioners# Christmas Dinner .#Typically  or so folk gather for their Christmas dinner and some light entertainment on the Friday before Christmas but, of course, that isn’t possible this year.

Give until January  and public donations will be doubled by the UK Government, up to £ million – meaning we can reach even more hungry children in Liberia with le-changing school meals.Please visit marysmeals.org.uk Christmas to set your place.Wishing you a peaceful and happy Christmas.Daniel Adams , executive director, Mary’s Meals UKSir,What happened to Lochgilphead postmaster Findlay Campbell was tragic.But we need to get the post office service back.I realise that a Post Office van comes up from Tarbert three days a week at the moment, but with a queue of  people having to stand in the cold and damp # as there was on a Wednesday recently # this is hardly conducive to the customers# health, let alone convenience.I trust something is being done tothis much-needed service to the town of Lochgilphead.Celia MacFarlane, LochgilpheadSir,During questions to Transport Secretary Michael Matheson on Thursday December , I told the minister that people were exasperated with the condition of both the A and A after years of promises of investment in them.Mr Matheson’s response, which mainly referenced plans to upgrade the A and the A, will be of little comfort to residents and businesses in the West Highlands who are utterly dependent on the A and A.We have had more than enough woolly pledges over the years, usually made in the run-up to an election, which are then quietly forgotten afterwards, and I’m afraid that Michael Matheson’s response indicates that it will be business as usual as far as his government is concerned.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,I found your article on #Tougher health cuts worry# in the December  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser very dficult to read.I was concerned about the statement attributed to Councillor Mulvaney saying: #It is the same things that are there # learning disability, older people and physical disability # all chunky sums of money at circa £k to ££k#.Yes, they are chunky sums of money and have been on the agenda for some time.  However, we are talking about people human beings who have ious disabilities, learning, physical, and people who are older, something that will eventually happen to us all. People are not just a category for cost cutting, particularly those most vulnerable.This statement could be interpreted in many ways. For me it reads that people with such disabilities and getting older are a drain on our resources, and we need to cut out the services we provide for them. It all sounds like they are a burden on the finances, and that has got to stop. All because the budget must be balanced#at any cost it seems.My question to Councillor Mulvaney is quite simple # What you would do to address these particular costs  Decant everyone into another council area, or simply just hope thatservices are cut so they cannot live in their own homes, or indeed anywhere within Argyll and Bute, they leave Perhaps CouncillorMulvaney has never experienced anyone with disabilities. I have, and unless one has that experience then putting a price on providing a quality service is impossible. Vulnerable people need support which gives them, as much as possible, some sort of a meaningful le. Maybe that is why costs cannot actually be cut, and there needs to be a complete re-think. People are not just a statistic, nor should they be apparently dismissed as a commodity that is costing too much.If the HSCP does not have enough funding to deliver the services stated in the strategic plan, and to the standards it states, it needs to fight to get the correct level of funding from the Scottish Government, or perhaps look at itself and cut down on what I see are excessive layers of management, to make savings in order to deliver to the right level of all services within Argyll and Bute.Heather A Grier, CowalSir,A tunnel in the Faroe Islands is almost complete.

These species grow in the arid conditions of the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, where they have been tapped for their precious sap for millennia.Mentioned in ancient Hebrew texts, frankincense and myrrh were prized for the sweet aromatic fumes they produce when burned, and were used to freshen the airduring embalming of the dead and offering sacrices to the gods. Frankincense and myrrh are components of incense, and as such were carried along ancient trade routes.Incense reached Western Europe with crusaders ing from the Eastern Roman Empire where it was wafted in churches, a use that continues today.Also, frankincense and myrrh are used in traditional Chinese medicines # recommended for conditions as erse as inflammation, pain, fever, indigestion and ulcers. They are also components of mosquito deterrents, deodorants and toothpaste. All fairly obscure you may think, but sales of frankincense have recently rocketed it is now an important part of the international, multi-million pound essential oil industry. Great for the trade, but the booming market is putting severe strain on the supply chain*.Back in the Horn of Africa the trees are suffering. Powerful middle men are encouraging local owners to over-tap their trees for this desirable commodity, resulting in stressed trees, less seed production and virtually no young trees growing up to maintain the plantations.Yet, there is hope, but speed is of the essence. Tappers are being encouraged to form co-operatives, and are getting expert help with tree management. Nevertheless, spare a thought for the growers and the trees as you enjoy your frankincense-scented bath over the Christmas break.* New Scientist   December "},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts december 25 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All of our young people are our future andthey require a little help to get there, then so be it.I have heard that Councillor Mulvaney says he has an accounting background, but he seems to lack compassion. Is this a trait of accountants He is depute leader of the council and policy lead for financial services and major projects. To my mind he is not showing a particularly good example to his fellow councillors by making statements that are ill-informed and condemn the vulnerable to miserable lives.Argyll and Bute Council led the way with #care in the community# when this was brought in by the Scottish Government now it seems it doesn’t give a damn for care in the community.Do his fellow councillors want to be tarred with the same brush Is everyone in Councillor Mulvaney#s Helensburgh Central ward hale and hearty with no disabilities  I do not think so.Maybe now is the time that Councillor Mulvaney looks at his current positions before Argyll and Bute Council gains a reputation it does not deserve.An incredibly angry resident of Argyll and Bute, name and address suppliedSir,End of le charity Marie Curie is calling on people across Scotland to brave the chill and do a festive dip to show support for those impacted by death, dying and bereavement.This year has been challenging for many and the charity sector has taken a huge hit, with fundraising events cancelled since Covid- hit in the spring.

Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home.

UK citizens will be allowed to stay in the EU for  days in any -day period without a visa, and the same will apply for EU citizens in the UK.The European Commission says the choice to end free movement ldquoinevitably means that business travel between the EU and the UK will no longer be as easy as it currently is.People heading from the UK for business have been told by the Government to check the requirements of the country they are travelling to.British passport holders will no longer be able to use the EU passport queue at airports and other borders.Will I need a visa for my holiday From , you will have to purchase a pound visa-waiver for holidays and short stays.UK nationals will not need a visa for short trips to EU countries theyre just going on holiday.But they will have to pay for a visa-waiver ndash this will cost euroand will be issued under the European Travel Information and Authorisation System.Can I work in the EU From  onwards you may need extra documents to work or study, or for trips longer than  days.Details of this have yet to be confirmed and it will likely depend on what you are doing and where you are going.But those going to work or study abroad, plus those just going on business trips, might be affected from January , , onwards.Will I need a blue passport No, your current passport is still eligible.Pre-Brexit, you could travel to EU countries on your passport right up to the point it expires ndash and that willcontinueto be the case this year, and will be until the end of the transition period on December .However, next year, the rules are changing.These changes were announced prior to the trade deal and arent expected to be affected by it.Under the new rules, fromJanuary , , when you visit most EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, your passport will need to have at least six months left on it until expiry and be less than ten years old on the day you travel.Will security change The UK will lose access to a iety of key EU databases - used by the police- covering things such as criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons.However, the UK will still have access to other systems which include cross-checks on fingerprints across Europe. This means that security co-operation will no longer be on ldquoreal-time access.The UK and the EU have reached an agreement on extradition, and the UKs role in Europol, the cross-border security agency, allows it to sit in on meetings but not have a direct say in decisions.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"absolutely confident\" the deal \"protects our police co-operation, protects our ability to catch criminals and to share intelligence across the European continent in the way that we have done for many years\".What about fishing The value of fish being caught by the EU in UK waters will be reduced by % and will be phased into transition over a five-and-a-half-year period.Once the transition period is over, the UK will fully control access to its waters and could make much deeper cuts.What is the impact on EU citizens living in the UK While Brexit affects everyone in the UK, the most immediate direct impact is on the . million people living here who are citizens of other EU countries.If you are a European Economic Area or Swiss citizen living in Britain, you wont have to leave the UK because weve left the EU.

There are plainly the financial resources to deal with this.It is an inexcusable dereliction of duty on their part and will not be forgiven or forgotten by people whose jobs and livelihoods are being threatened by this ongoing crisis.Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands Region.I was happy to hear from my constituents when I was out and about in Bowmore again recently.Many pressing  matters were raised including the poor condition of pavements, faultily street lights at Stanalane and potholes on Shore St and Jamieson St.The recent vandalism of the hand sanitiser dispenser within the bus shelter is as worrying as it is unacceptable.All of these matters and more have been raised with the appropriate department and I will continue to lobby relentlessly for better infrastructure across the Kintyre and the Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.I see Claudia Winkleman is to be paid £ million for her #work#.While I am sure she is a capable broadcaster, and may be worth a good salary, surely £ million is extracting the liquid.I have calculated that this sum amounts to ,  free television licences for the over-s. When you then think of other celebrities earning mouth-watering sums from the BBC, this gives clear evidence that the BBC could quite easily continue with the free television licences for the over-s.My income does not qualy for pension credit by a small margin but I have now had two communications from TV Licensing reminding me to pay the fee.Each time it encloses a brochure and ious forms to complete in the hope that I feel empowered to pay the £. required to watch TV.So far, I have decided to weather the storm and not pay. My hope is that thousands of over-s do likewise and Auntie will realise that expecting us to fall into line is not as simple as it expects.Silver Voices continue to pressure the BBC to think again and reinstate free licences for the over-s.It has my full support and will continue to do so until the BBC bites the bullet and cancels its continued harassment of OAPs.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.For many of us, the festive season is a time for giving and sharing, which is why we’re inviting you to celebrate Giving Tuesday.I’d like to take a moment to share with your readers how, in choosing to give to our charity, Revitalise, you’ll be making a real dference to the lives of the disabled people and carers that we support.As a charity we know that however tricky this past year has been, le is about spending time with the people we love, and everyday le can so easily get in the way of that. Hilary has cared for her son Shaun since he had an accident on holiday in Ibiza, aged .Caring is simply something she does for the person she loves. As she explains: #For the last  years I’ve been caring for Shaun but I definitely wouldn’t call myself a carer, it’s just something I do as his mum.#I’m never, ever, going to give up on my son. Le is too short you know you need to keep fighting.#On top of the dficulties this year has presented, disabled people and the elderly have also been left with far less support than usual, as the Emergency Coronavirus Act allowed local authorities to axe their duty of care responsibilities. Feeling vulnerable and abandoned, many carers are close to breaking point.#This is why we have launched our campaign, Care For Carers and the fundraiser Raise a Million, aiming to raise £ million to support carers and their loved ones to access respite care breaks following lockdown.We have provided respite care breaks # a vital leline to so many unpaid home carers and their disabled loved ones # for over  years.So, in celebration of Giving Tuesday this month, why not pledge to give something special to our charity this festive season I am so proud to work for Revitalise as we amply the voice of carers, and will continue to do so until carers stories are heard. Please support our campaignyou can, and help us spread the word about the struggles carers are facing right now.To find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or the ways that we may be able to support guests, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Devon Prosser, Revitalise"},{"url":null,"title":"paving the way for a future in sport","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The moon lit up the landscape and the whole earth breathed peace.The only sound was the quiet lapping as the ocean rolled its waves once again to the shore. The darkness was penetrated by billions of pinpricks of light, reminding me that light has the last word.We are waiting for the lighter nights. We are waiting for the ening days. We are waiting for the light. We are waiting for the light, and for the le light.We wait quietly in a cosmic silence. Waiting can bring peace as we find God’s presence in the present. Waiting can bring hope as we know the light will come.But it’s hard to stop and wait it’s not easy to pause and ponder it’s dficult to take time at this time. We’re busy with the bargains and not so bothered about the baby.We’re busy with the tinsel but haven’t time for the truth. We’re busy with the mince pies and we will get round to the manger.We’re busy trying to fix the tree lights but have forgotten about theWe’re busy with the cards but have pushed away the crib. We’re busy – it is Christmas after all.We just don’t have time right now. We will make time for God when we’re less busy. And God crept in beside us when we were busy."},{"url":null,"title":"rosie reflects on the wonders of nature","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And then, over the next couple of years, we slowly got them recorded.#Since forming The Strunts, the duo have performed live for a handful of gigs including the Kintyre Songwriters Festival and a couple of Homesong sets.David added: #Obviously it’s been impossible to perform recently and, as a result, we focussed on getting the album out. We#re delighted to say it is now for sale at The Kintyre Larder and The Fish Shop with donations from it going to Kintyre Food Bank and Children First.#Since the album#s release, the pair have had some great reviews in the music press, including this one from Ian D Hall in the Liverpool Sound And Vision: #Together as The Strunts, Les and David have found a common cause, one that sees the release of the album Too Much Of Everything, consistently catching the ear throughout.#The listener starts to understand that the only things you can have too much of are hate, apathy, ignorance and grief, that even in anger there must be subtle humour paving the way to the hope of healing.#A tremendous introduction to a new partnership.#Too Much of Everything is available for £ at The Kintyre Larder and at The Fish Shop, with  per cent of those sales being donated to the food bank and Children First until the end of January."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane december 18 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The landlord claimed that through inadvertent evidence upon which he proposed to rely had not been led before the court below and the appeal was allowed. Having heard the additional evidence, the higher court have now refused the appeal, and find the landlord appellant liable in expenses.In the course of a note, the court state that it was not disputed that the applicant was a yearly tenant of his house and land, and that his tenancy did not cease on his employment being brought to an end.Section  of the Crofters Act, , does not therefore apply, as these subjects were not let during the continuance of the employment, and he was not a tradesman placed in the district by the landlord for the benefit of the neighbourhood.Indeed, the respondent#s agent refused to found upon that section, and he placed his case upon the general argument that as this house was required for an estate servant, it would be a great hardship for the proprietor to be deprived of its use for that purpose, after the applicant#s intimation that he did not propose any longer to accept employment from the estate.The tenant has fulfilled all the statutory conditions and titling him to be declared a statutory small tenant, and we have no option but to grant an order to that effect. We therefore agree with the court below that this play falls to be repelled.The only other points raised by the respondent was that these subjects did not constitute a holding in respect that the ground attached to the house was of comparatively small extent. For the reasons stated by Mr Barber, we do not see that we can give effect to this plea, and as the appellants agent stated that he did not raise any question on the amount of rent fixed, we have refused the appeal.Agent for the landlord # Mr Archd.

All important, yes, but why did he fail to mention the two sectors that face the challenge to their survival caused by Brexit: farming and fishing  Both sectors face severe financial ruin.On fishing, west coast fishermen rely on rapid transit to get their catches of prawns, langoustines, crabs and lobsters to Europe within  hours of landing.These vital exports will, due to Brexit, be subject to senseless bureaucracy of red tape before they reach their destination.Warnings from the fishing businesses all along the west coast of Scotland have been ignored by the UK Government. Coupled with this delay are tarfs set as Britain will no longer be an EU member.Next, to farming. Everything points to constant financial hardship. Lamb exports, vital for every sheep farmer in Scotland, face EU levies of  per cent of the value of these animals.For example, prime lambs currently worth £ to export will near be worth £. These levels ofwill make sheep production unviable. All exports of world famous Scotch beef will be levied, as well as Scotch food and drink exports currently worth many millions to the Scottish economy.In the  EU referendum, Scotland voted  per cent to  per cent to remain in the EU. As everyone in the UK surveys the last minute shambles of #No deal or bad deal#, they must be amazed at the absolute mess we are in.Our chance of salvation or rescue comes next May when Scotland has a chance to let Mr Cameron realise the folly of his party#s ways.Robert MacIntyre, Rothesay.First our children painted rainbows, then we stood on our doorsteps applauding the NHS.Now Scotland#s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and devolved administration will grant a one-off #thank you# payment to all NHS Scotland staff. The gross sum of £ will be paid to all full-time staff, including primary care and home care staff and care home and hospice workers.This bonus sum, costing upwards of £ million, will be taxable, resulting in those NHS staff members on the lowest income likely to be hit the hardest.Part-time staff are to receive a #proportionate share# and employees in receipt of top-up benefits may experience a #knock-on# effect on entitlements.The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, said #many care home workers are part-time, so the fear is that they will end up with a derisory payment#.Let#s also remember that in England and Wales, tax is payable at  per cent on taxable income up to £,. In Scotland, our tax is payable at  per cent on taxable income up to £,.Le Presidente Nicola and her Sepratista Nationale Politicohave put on something akin to a magic show. The question you may wish to ask yourself, is this worthy of your applause Tommy Macpherson, Saddell.I was disappointed that my amendment, brought to the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Islands Area Committee to retain the underspend of £, designated for Tarbert regeneration improvements, was not supported by Councillor Alastair Redman.I appreciate that the councillors who represent Lochgilphead were keen that the additional monies should top-up the costs of the project at the Front Green as that tender has come in much in excess of the original budget, but it is deplorable that a councillor elected to represent Tarbert chose to vote against the amendment that would have allowed Tarbert to benefit from the funding allocated for improvements in the village.I would assure all residents in Tarbert that I will work for the people of Tarbert, who elected me to represent them in the best way I can.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands.Being a previous resident in the Wee Toon, and now residing in Helensburgh, I totally agree that Campbeltown and all other rural places in Argyll, should have been moved to tier one a couple of weeks ago.Helensburgh has had its tier two status challenged recently by sailors from Faslane in several groups going to the boozers and buying #substantial# meals with several beers, but are classed as being from the same household due to being on the same ship.Also #Weegies# getting the short train journey from Glasgow and breaching the travel rules to infest the area unlawfully.We are the closest town to the Covid hot spots, which certainly doesn#t help matters.I hope Nicola Sturgeon sees sense and allows all rural places in Argyll to be exempt from the harsh restrictions that are unfairly spread over the whole of the region.Name and address supplied.I see Bruno Tonioli is pocketing £, a minute during his current appearances on Strictly Come Dancing which equates to a further  free TV licences for the over s.Is it any wonder the BBC has a problem with those of us refusing to pay the licence fee of £. when it can pay mouth-watering sums to endless so-called celebrities.I realise the BBC has a duty to honour contracts but perhaps honouring previous pledges to OAPs over  would be a way forward.I also see water bills are likely to increase every year for the next six years, adding an average increase in council tax bills of £ per annum.Seeing as it seems to have rained every day since October in this part of the world, I begin to wonder how water companies can equate this increase to all citizens who have no alternative other than to pay.Perhaps internal budgeting within these companies could well be a sensible solution.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.We are launching the Young People’s Board for Change, and want to recruit  members aged between  and  years, from across the country.The board members will use the  to raise awareness of what matters most to them, take action and make change happen.

Well, as the Native Americans might say, #the story might not necessarily be true, but it is full of truth#.However you view this, something wonderful happened on a starry night over , years ago # something too wonderful to explain in simple words. The ordinary merged with the extraordinary and hope was born.The ordinary and the extraordinary became the midwe of our faith.One explanation could be that Jupiter and Saturn were in alignment on that starry night so long ago.What do astronomers make of this idea Tim O#Brien, associate director of Jodrell Bank Observatory, suggests this would have looked striking.#It#s remarkable how much your attention is drawn when two very bright objects come together in the sky,# he explains.And once the planets lined up in their orbits, Earth would #overtake# the others, meaning that Jupiter and Saturn would appear to change direction in the night sky. A wandering star I invite you to look to the south west about an hour after sunset on the winter solstice, December .You may see something that has not happened for  years. Jupiter and Saturn will come so close together that it will look just like one giant, amazing star.Could this astronomical display of beauty have happened around the time of Jesus#s birth I believe God uses nature to speak to us, and the more time we spend learning about the wonders of nature, the closer we come to God."},{"url":null,"title":"msp presses for detail on football funding","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Many may be living on their own for the first time and often will not have a network of friends and family around to offer them support.Christmas can be a particularly dficult and isolating time for care leavers as they find themselves having to spend the festive season on their own, especially this year when Covid- restrictions mean it will be dficult to go out to socialise and the usual large-scale Christmas dinners for care leavers will not be taking place.However, the charity Family Action runs Listening Works, a free virtual helpline specically for young care leavers aged  to  years old across the UK. We are here all evening, every evening pm to midnight and even over the festive period, December  to January , we are still available from pm to pm.So,you are a care leaver, whether you’ve got something on your mind or you just fancy a friendly chat, we’re here for you when many other services are shut or not available.You can call us on   , text us on    or you can have a web chat with us via our website at www.family-action.org.uk listening-works – whatever kind of listening works for you, we are here.Our trained volunteers can offer you someone to talk to – a listening ear, a friendly voice and a chance to talk openly about whatever’s on your mind.We also offer signposting to useful resourcesany specic issues come up and information about other support out there and how to get it.So,you are a care leaver, or know a care leaver who might benefit, please remember Listening Works is here for you and not just for Christmas. Please get in touch.David Holmes CBE, chief executive, Family Action.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, online grooming crimes in Scotland were more than  per cent higher when children were not at school compared with the same months last year.The NSPCC has been calling for legislation to protect children from grooming, abuse and harmful content online, since . After years of the charity campaigning, on December , the UK Government announced the framework for a future Online Harms Bill that has the potential to provide much greater protection for children when they use the internet.This is a landmark moment – a major step towards legislation that can make an enforceable legal duty of care on tech companies a reality. For too long children have been exposed to disgraceful abuse and harm online.Social media companies will have a duty to protect young users from child abuse and harmful content online and face fines of up to £ million or  per cent of their global turnoverthey fail.But that doesn’t mean that the work we do stops now. For instance, the proposals fall short of ensuring criminal sanctions against named directors whose companies fail to uphold their duty of care.Child protection and children’s voices must remain front and centre of regulatory requirements. We have set out six tests for robust regulation – including action to tackle both online sexual abuse and harmful content and a regulator with the power to investigate and hold tech firms to account with criminal and financial sanctions.Failing to pass any of the six tests will mean that future generations of children will pay with serious avoidable harm and sexual abuse.We will now be closely scrutinising the proposals against those tests. Above all, legislation must ensure Ofcom has the power and resources to enforce the duty of care and be able to identy and then take appropriate action against tech firms that fail.For more information, search ‘NSPCC six tests’.Joanna Barrett, policy and public affairs manager, NSPCC Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"mcconnachie claims dunavertys december medal","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes a miss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.The events that Scotlandrsquos festive season are famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year.

I was always mesmerised by how quickly the rough landscape changed into a white wonderland like from the most beautul fairy tale. This was also the time that I associated with countless presents . Who does not like them !Now I still adore winter but for dferent reasons, namely for its wildle visitors to the country. Last month, I introduced you to one of them ndash the short-eared owl ndash and now it is time I presented my favourite winter migrant: the Bohemian waxwing.The sight of a waxwing can brighten up any winter day, regardless of how keen on birding you are. Two years ago, I was privileged to spend a fantastic afternoon with these birds.It was a chilling but sunny day. As my dad, who is a nature lover, was visiting me for Christmas, I took the opportunity to take him on a trip to Aberlady. This place is always rich in all sorts of wildle. I also knew that some waxwing sightings had been recorded earlier that week.As soon as we arrived, I spotted a rather big flock of birds that briefly circulated above our heads before disappearing towards the reserve. Everything happened so fast that I did not have enough time to pick up my binoculars for a closer look at the birds.We rushed towards a copse of rowan trees, where I knew the waxwings would most likely congregate. As we were coming closer, I could recognise the merry trill that these stunning birds make as they were happily feeding on berries. You may remember from my previous articles how careful I am when it comes to approaching wildle. This time was no dferent we took our time watching the waxwings from a distance, letting them get used to our presence. This is a great technique to signal to wildle that we are no threat to them.Suddenly, the flock was spooked by a dog and raised high in the sky for a split second before landing above our heads. My dad and I gave each other a knowing grin and started admiring the beautul creatures sitting merely a couple of metres away from us. This was an unusual moment to me as a wildle photographer: the birds were so close that my lens was too big to capture the scene! But that picture of waxwings having a feast right above me will stay in my memory for a long time.Waxwings are often mistaken for common starlings. These two species are similar in size and, to an extent, profile.However,you look closely, you should spot the peach-brown colouring of waxwingsrsquo plumage. An even closer look will reveal the real charm and beauty that these birds possess: the enlivening neutral base colours are accompanied by splashes of white and red in the wings and a strong yellow band at the base of the tail. The head is crowned by a distinctive crest, which can be raised or lowered depending on the birdrsquos mood. Adding to their appeal is the prominent black mask on their eyes.Waxwings are gregarious birds, who can form large flocks consisting of hundreds of iniduals. They breed in boreal forest that extends from Scandinavia through Russia and across to the Pacic coast.Waxwings are a forgiving subject to photograph they do not encounter humans within their breeding habitats, therefore are approachable on their winter grounds, providing a great opportunity to capture them feeding on colourful berry trees.Waxwings make a loud but cheerful trill as they scour the landscape looking for fruit.Berries are incredibly important for waxwings in the winter. These birds can eat up to twice their body weight, which makes around -, berries a day!Their diet changes during their breeding season as the birds switch to feeding on mosquitoes and midges.Our native rowan is their favoured tree, but they will happily feed on hawthorn, cotoneaster and rosehips as well as dried fruit.If waxwings are in the area and you do not have berries, they can be attracted into gardens using apple halves hung from a tree. It is common to spot waxwings in such ordinary places as supermarket car parks, as they often have ornamental shrubs with berries.This was my first year writing Zanrsquos Wildle Diary and I have greatly enjoyed sharing my stories and experiences with you.

Get compostingChristmas - with its inevitable surfeit of food - can often mean bulging bins full of food waste, which is terrible news for the environment. However, you can easily make your own organic compost and plant food, whatever size of garden you have.There are many ways to do this, including bokashi bins which use friendly bacteria to break down any kind of food . Whether its a balcony wormery to a traditional garden compost heap, however you do it your plantswill thank you.. Make a new pondAny water in the garden is brilliant for helping wildle, as well as an attractive feature and a chance to grow dferent plants. Small ponds can easily be made without using a plastic or fibreglass liner - any watertight container will do, such as an old bucket or bath - and can be sunk in the ground or kept proud of it.Just be sure that there is a ramp from inside the pond so that amphibians, hedgehogs and the like can get out easily. Larger ponds can be made from puddled clay, or use the thickest, longest-lasting butyl liner possible.. Re-use plastic potsPlant suppliers are increasingly using biodegradable or recyclable pots, but what to do with the stock of black plastic ones in the shed  Throwing away perfectly usable pots, whatever they are made of, makes no environmental sense.A better option is to use everything, plastic pots included, until it is at the end of its le, and then replace itnecessary with a more environmentally-friendly alternative.Broken plastic pots can now be recycled at most large garden centres. If you dont need them, perhaps a community or school garden has a use for them . Use water sustainablyA simple change or two can make big steps towards water sustainability. First, install a water butt. Rainwater is better for plants than tap water anyway and it will save on water bills. Most water butts tend to be made of plastic, so why not get a water-butt erterand repurpose an old barrel . Grow your ownEating a plant-based diet is one of the best ways to reduce your carbon footprint, so grow your own veg. Even in the depths of winter you can grow microgreens indoors on your windowsill for quick crops of tasty, nutritious leaves - try radish, beetroot or coriander.. Enlist nature to help with pest controlBug sprays that kill garden pests such as aphids are environmentally damaging and kill other insects such as bees. By planting flowers that attract aphid-eating wildle, such as hoverflies and ladybirds, nature will do the job for you.Daisy-type flowers such as marigoldsand flat-topped flowers such as yarrow and fennel are all popular with beneficial insects.

If yoursquore feeling fresh you can follow it out of the city centre towards Balerno and Currie, or in the opposite direction towards Leith, where you will be spoiled for choice with coffee shops in which to get yourself a sweet treat as a reward.Falls of Falloch, near CrianlarichAll of the views, but none of the effort: the Falls of Falloch is a perfect walk for those who are feeling a bit lazy. You simply need to park up in the designated car parkand then stroll along a short path to reach an opening where you can see the waterfall. Arguably, it looks at its best in winter, when the extra rainfall makes the water incredibly powerful albeit slightly intimidating.You can view the waterfall from the path itself but therersquos also a dedicated, rather special viewing  designed by John Kennedy and constructed from steel rods. Named Woven Sound, it contains extracts from the diary of poet Dorothy Wordsworth at the end of its caged viewpoint, the details of which will encourage you to properly embrace the surroundings rather than just snapping a picture and walking away. Be warned though that while beautul it can be slightly frightening to look down through the walkway and see a sheer drop to the water below.Southerness Beach, DumfriesThis wide, sandy beach is quiet enough that you will have the place mostly to yourself, yet it falls within the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and offers some views out towards Cumbria and beyond. You can even spot dolphins or seals in the wateryou are lucky, or at least a couple of seabirds.Inverewe Gardens and Estate, Poolewe, Wester RossGardens and estate open daily from dawn until dusk, and entry is pound into the honesty box. Peaceful, picturesque and easy to walk around, Inverewe Gardens provides the ideal spot to soak up some nature without having to expend too much effort. The gardens are also a bit of a natural phenomenon, as species that shouldnrsquot grow in this part of the world are flourishing, thanks to the warm currents of the Gulf Stream and some clever planting design. As well as admiring the plants on display, the position of the garden on the banks of Loch Ewe means you might also be able to spot coastal birds, seals and even otters. To extend your walk further, head for the trails that lead around the Inverewe estate, where your four-legged friends are also welcome .Mugdock Reservoir, MilngavieIf you are feeling a bit lethargic after days of over-eating, you might not fancy struggling up a steep hill on your post-Christmas walk. Yoursquoll be pleased to hear, therefore, that there is hardly any incline whatsoever in the loop around Milngaviersquos two adjoining reservoirs. Whether you choose to tackle Mugdock or Craigmadddie or both, you will be greeted by a flat, pleasant circuit that is particularly popular over the Christmas holidays.You can stroll three miles round one reservoir, or sixyou want to do both, with woodlands at the edge of the Mugdock Reservoir for those who want to extend their walk further. And when you finish, you can head to Bullandrsquos Coffee House on Milngaviersquos Mugdock Road for a warming drink.Duff House to the Bridge of Alvah, Banff, AberdeenshireBuilt in , the three-storey Duff House is a Category A-listed structure that is considered to be one of the finest buildings in the north of Scotland. The interior is currently closed due to Covid, but you can still marvel at the architecture and landscaped grounds of the house before venturing on a two-mile walk to the impressive Bridge of Alvah. It takes about  minutes to get from the car park of Duff House to the bridge itself, but you will encounter some notable points of interest in the route through the woods to get there. Kids will love spotting Duff Ice Houseand a bit further along, a striking neo-Gothic mausoleum. Looking particularly beautul in the snow, this th-century tomb was built by the second Earl of Fe to house the remains of his ancestors. From there, you can continue through the woodland before reaching the Bridge of Alvah.Loch Faskally and the Salmon Ladder, Pitlochry, PerthshireTherersquos no shortage of picturesque walks in Perthshire, the ldquoBig Tree Country. Butyou are looking for one that isnrsquot too taxing, try this leisurely loop that leads from Pitlochry out to Loch Faskally and back again. Start at the Port-Na-Craig suspension bridge and cross the River Tummel towards the famous Festival Theatre, making your way past the Fish Ladder and Dam. Admiring the views of the loch as you go, the path then leads through some pretty woodland before crossing Loch Faskally on the Clunie Foot Bridge and winding back to the village along the waterrsquos edge. A great option for blowing away the cobwebs without too much effort.Glenfer Braes, near BarrheadOn a clear, December day, Glenfer Braes at Barrhead offers one of the best views in Greater Glasgow. If you park at the designated car park near to Caplethill Road, you only have to walk a couple of yards before being greeted with a sweeping panorama out across the south of the city. Beyond that, the park has plenty more to explore for those feeling up to it with the wider Glenfer Braes Country Park boasting woodland, marshland, a large reservoir and its very own herd of Highland cattle.Corrieshalloch Gorge National Nature Reserve, Auchindrean, UllapoolCorrieshalloch Gorge means ldquougly hollow in Gaelic but donrsquot let that put you off. In fact, the gorge is one of the most impressive in the country, a mile-long canyon through which the River Droma weaves it way towards the coast. There is a shorthike down to the gorge itself, where you will find a beautul suspension bridge which allows you to soak in the spectacular views. A word of warning ndashyou donrsquot like heights, give this one a miss.Dean Castle Country Park, KilmarnockThe star of this Ayrshire park is the th-century Dean Castle, an impressive structure used in the filming of the TV mega-hit show Outlander.

Most political commentators,myself included, dismissed him as a charlatan, a buffoon, an intellectually lazy chancer who just got lucky when he was elected London Mayor in . But no one has a lucky streak as long as his without having a touch of genuine political genius.:Ian McConnell on Brexit: We are now all bedevilled by bitter fruits of Tory ision: OpinionConsider his record. Mr Johnson led the Leave campaign to victory in  when the opinion polls said he would lose. He went on to become leader of the Conservative Party, by a landslide, and then renegotiated the EU Withdrawal Deal that everyone said could not be reopened. That helped him win an astonishing near-landslide victory in the  General Election, plunging Labour to its worst defeat since . Now finally, tonight, he will have the satisfaction of seeing the House of Commons vote forhis Brexmas trade deal. The one all the smart people said was never going to happen.Many in the commentariat suspected that Mr Johnson had decided to go for a no deal Brexit ndash or what he called an ldquoAustralian-style deal on ruinous WTO terms. It was thought he was in the pocket of hardline Tory backbenchers. That hersquod been outplayed by the clever lawyers of Brussels.The ex-Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, mocked Mr Johnsonrsquos talk of an ldquooven-ready deal and said the EU would never allow Britain to leave the jurisdiction of the European Court. Now even Mr Farage agrees that ldquothe war is over.You can call it a ldquothin deal, or second best to EU membership and I would agree, never having wanted to leave Europe in the first place. Britain will undoubtedly lose by no longer being part of the ldquofrictionless European single market. But this is undoubtedly a comprehensive trade deal, guaranteeing tarf and quota-free access to the market. The fishing industry isnrsquot pleased. But there was always going to be a trade-off between EU access to British waters and UK access to European markets for fish.The fact that it is really only the fishing industry crying ldquobetrayal tells you all you need to know. The vast majority of businesses, and the general public, heaved a massive sigh of relief on Christmas Eve, even in Scotland. I donrsquot think the opposition parties fully appreciated how their forecasting of no deal had affected the psychology of voters. People were genuinely afraid that shelves would empty, food prices would rocket, travel to Europe would end and the economy would tank. With their catastrophism, the opposition parties did Mr Johnsonrsquos work for him.Of course, there are many reasons for criticising this deal, not least its vagueness about the level playing field trade rules, but what it cannot be described as is a reckless no deal Brexit. Yet only a fortnight ago, Nicola Sturgeon accused the Prime Minister, not for the first time, of ldquoactively planning a no deal Brexit and said the prospects for a trade deal were ldquovanishingly thin. Now, in an astonishing volte face, the SNP leader has ordered her MPs to vote against the deal in the Commons tonight.This may make sense to diehard Remainers, but it will bamboozle many voters. They believed the opposition parties when they said they would move heaven and earthto prevent Britain leaving the EU without a trade deal. How can they possibly justy rejecting the only one on offer, and not a bad one either Only a year ago, the SNP, along with a majority of MPs in the Commons, voted for the Benn Act. This ordered the Prime Minister to do everything in his power to avoid a no deal Brexit, including delaying Article  and Brexit itself. The SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry took the PM to court to prevent no deal. The Supreme Court ruled that he was acting unlawfully in risking one by saying he would rather ldquodie in a ditch. Now Ms Sturgeon seems to have opted for the very ditch he vacated.If there were any chance of an alternative deal, such as membership of the European Economic Area, then voting against the Brexmas Agreement might have made sense. But the opposition parties missed their chance of delivering a soft Brexit last year by failing to vote for one. There is no alternative deal on offer and clearly no time to negotiate one before the January  deadline.The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, saw the way the Brexit wind was blowing and ordered his troops to back the deal, on the not-unreasonable grounds that this was what he had been asking for all along. He didnrsquot want to repeat Jeremy Corbynrsquos mistakes. The SNP thinks it can safely vote against the deal because there is no chance of it being defeated. But political leaders canrsquot take the voters for fools. Mr Johnson will say it is not only defying the will of Brexit voters, and the will of Parliament, it is defying logic in voting for No Deal.Very few prime ministers actually make history. Margaret Thatcher did, by destroying Labour and the trade unions Tony Blair did by reinventing Labour again and winning three elections. But neither of them made as massive a dent in the British constitutional timeline as the politician universally known as ldquoBoris. No one is laughing at him any more.Twitter will still call him a racist, unfairly, since he isnrsquot. Ms Sturgeon will continue to label the PM ldquosexist .

That is only to be expected in such a wide-ranging deal. Fishing is a case in point.

It is ironically following the red wall areas into Torydom.What is revealing day by day are the many personal benefits iniduals had from EU membership which are either gone or heavily restricted by this deal. The Brexiters, who included Labour members and MPs, chanted about \"taking back control\". What has happened is that the elite have taken back control and the ordinary citizen is now restricted, even penned in. That will become more apparent as the months pass.Restrictions on time you can spend in the EU now that one is a \"third country\". Limits on personal goods one can bring back through customs from the EU. VAT will now have to be paid on some goods. Ordering from the EU online will be subject to restrictions. Ironically, posting goods or presents to friends in Northern Ireland will need customs forms filled out detailing weight.Labour is deeply implicated in this act now. Scotland is no longer Better Together hemmed in in this Union. A new curtain is being raised to restrict and deprive the population from benefits which will stop abruptly on December  at pm European time.John Edgar, Kilmaurs.*THE SNP likes to say that it represents the whole of Scotland. The Scottish Government has adverts with \"we are Scotland\" as the tagline. Of course, this isnt true. If it were, then about one-third of its MPs would vote for the Brexit trade deal. This would much better reflect the actual Scotland it claims to represent.David Bone, Girvan.SCOTLAND NEEDS A CANADA DEALMICHAEL Gove asserts that the UK market, not the EU, is what is most important to Scotland, and of course trade benefits work both ways. Perhaps Mr Gove is thinking of Canada, which sends nearly % of its exports to one destination, the United States, and is still a highly successful independent country. That autonomous interaction is what Scotland must aim for, not as a powerless entity at the ldquowrong end of the UK.A study for the Economic and Social Research Councilfound that independence, and a loss of trading integration, would result in about a .% reduction in ldquoBritish trade each year, but would also mean that trade between Scotland and the rest of the world would increase. I think we could live with that, preferably as a member of EFTA and trading through the EEA into the EU Single Market. That would be the best of all worlds, to borrow a phrase, and should allow trade with rUK to continue without impediment or tarfs.GR Weir, Ochiltree.WHY BRUSSELS IS BETTERDUNCAN Soomanfinds it dficult to understand why independence-minded Scots ldquowill not be governed by Westminster but ldquodesperately want to be governed by Brussels\". Perhaps I can enlighten him.As Brexit has shown, a sovereign nation decides its own future. What Scotland is ldquodesperate for, is to make its own independent decisions, in Scotlandrsquos best interests. An independent Scotland would decide, at the time, what was in its best interests. If that was rejoining the EU, then the Scottish-elected government would endeavour to make that a reality. If it were not, we would decide, as an independent nation, to pursue another destiny.Itrsquos not that dficult really ndash all we want is to decide for ourselves, rather than have what suits England foisted upon us.John McCallum, Glasgow G.* DUNCAN Sooman asked \"why be governed by Brussels\"  As part of the UK Scotland has to accept Westminsters decisions.

He should also remember that Scotland overwhelmingly voted against any type of Brexit. I have faith that the SNP group of MPs sent to Westminster will always vote in the best interests of the people of Scotland. Its called democracy.Alec Oattes, Ayr.WOULD ENGLAND SELF-HARM IAN Lakinseems to have a very poor grasp of the reality of both the value of the UK economy and of the basics of trade.As so many do, he says that The UK is the ldquofth-largest economy, without recognising thatthat is true, it became true while we were in the EU. There is no guarantee that it will still be true outside the EU, as we have left behind the multitude of existing excellent trade deals that we had around the world, made through the EU for us, and will have to renegotiate each one inidually, before we again receive the benefit of them to our economy. So the UK is likely to be far from being ldquothe fth-largest economy for however long that takes.As to Scotland being ldquoup the creek without a paddlewe lose our massive export market in rUK, he is looking at this question the wrong way round. We export to England, as in any inter-state trading situation, that of which we have an abundance beyond our own needs and they have a shortage. The situation of Ireland, which had about  per cent of its trade with the UK before independence, and now is surviving extremely well with only around %, is a clear example.It is worth noting too that Ireland has reached this point while within the EU, due to the range of markets that this membership has opened up. Why therefore, would Scotland be any dferent  After independence, would England suddenly no longer need what we are able to send, and where  could they source so much at the drop of a hat, with all those EU deals to renegotiate Scotland would not be the partner to force the breaking of this link, and for England to do so, would be a massive act of self-harm. But then, we have just discovered that such self-harm does not seem to deter English nationalists.P Davidson, Falkirk.GIVE US THE INDEPENDENCE COSTINGSBREXIT is indeed an act of economic self-harm . It is puzzling that anyone would vote for such damage to the economy even for theof the control of some mythical levers. But the publication of this estimate by the Scottish Government begs the question:it can produce this estimate of the impact of Brexit, what is stopping the production of a similar prediction of the economic effects that would followwe voted for independence We know from GERS that Scottish independence would result in an immediate pound billion cut to the budget of the Scottish Government and from the SNPs Sustainable Growth Commission that there would be a short and medium decline in economic growth, even greater than Brexit will bring. And we know that Scotland conducts much more business within the UK than with the EU. It is likely that the SNP already has its own estimates of the economic damage that independence would cause. If it does, it is unlikely that it would let them become public, but I would assume there were Government calculations done at the time of the  referendum. If the Scottish Government can turn out estimates on Brexit within days of the deal being signed surely it can, building on what is already known in public and in private, produce authoritative estimates on independence, an idea that has been around for a century and, on the existing evidence, is likely to be even more economically damaging than Brexit Alex Gallagher, Labour councillor, Largs."},{"url":null,"title":"new-year-hopes-measuring-success","story":"Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, a senior registrar in intensive care medicine, remembers working through the night on Christmas Eve.ldquoThe past few weeks have been the toughest NHS workers have faced yet in the battle against Covid, she said. ldquoThe virus has not discriminated as much as we thought it would.

The Prime Minister ran down the clock in the most cynical fashion, giving parliamentarians just three working days to read, analyse, scrutinise and vote on , pages of complex legal text.ldquoThe UK economy will suffer a slow puncture as companies decide to work out of Europe in future rather than out of the UK.ldquoThe UK Government must step up and explain how on earth it will create new jobs and opportunities, how it will engage with our neighbours in Europe, and how it will work and trade with new countries.ldquoWhen our children look back at this time, they will be astonished that the UK Government voluntarily pursued this big-bang change in the middle of a global pandemic and the biggest economic and health crisis that this country has ever faced - it is quite astonishing.Veteran SNP MSP Bruce Crawford was cheered when he refused an intervention from Tory MSP Liam Kerr.ldquoI have only four minutes and I have had enough of Brexiteers for the rest of my le, frankly, Mr Crawford said.After the vote, SNP Constitution Secretary Michael Russell said: ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has backed this governmentrsquos position: saying No to a hard Brexit deal that will do enormous damage to our economy, our society and to the opportunities of this and future generations.ldquoBut, as it has done so throughout the Brexit process the UK Government will ignore the Scottish Parliament. This means in two daysrsquo time Scotland will be forced out of the European Single Market and Customs Union, hitting the economy and jobs at the worst possible time.ldquoThe Scottish Government will now do everything we can to mitigate the damage that will be caused.ldquoAnd we will continue to stick by our principles, our values and our beliefs - and we will stick by the people of Scotland, who have opposed Brexit at every turn.ldquoIt is therefore more important than ever that people in Scotland have the right to choose the best deal of all ndash a future as an independent country and equal partner inside the European Union.Labour Constitution spokesman Anas Sarwar added: \"Today the UK Labour Party put the national interest first and prevented no deal, and the Scottish Labour Party protected the devolution settlement by stating its opposition to the way in which the Tory government has catastrophically mishandled Brexit.ldquoIt is deeply encouraging that the Scottish Parliament has endorsed Labourrsquos call for the Erasmus scheme to be protected and for workersrsquo rights and environmental standards to be upheld.ldquoWe donrsquot defeat ision with more ision. We donrsquot defeat nationalism with more nationalism.ldquoOnly by working together in the national interest can we protect our society from the impact of Brexit and focus on rebuilding after Covid."},{"url":null,"title":"new-year-honours-list-heroes-covid-response-honoured-vital-role-helping-communities","story":"The response from Mr Majid and his staff to help vulnerable customers during the first lockdown went above and beyond with deliveries made and a local fund started.He also worked hard building relationships with projects in the Pakistan village where his family originate and Lanarkshire churches.

The Government committed then to help producers in case of severe disruption – now it is time we saw what support will be forthcoming. This week may be just a foretaste of the challenges coming in the new year, deal or no deal, so it is essential that our businesses can have a measure of confidence from the Government.”Shetland MSP, Beatrice Wishart said: “This is an incredibly serious situation. While reasonable public health measures are needed to control the spread of the virus, the government must do all it can to ensure island food exporters can get their perishable goods to market, at what is the busiest time of the year.“Michael Gove told me at a committee session last week that, for seafood exports after Brexit, government #will ensure that, in Kent, we do not have the type of traffic disruption that some have feared#. This disruption does not bode well for the end of the transition period in a just over a week’s time. The UK Government must urgently organise an extension to mitigate economic damage and help our vital food and drink businesses.”Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur said: “Businesses across the Highlands and Islands simply can’t afford to contend with the level of disruption in exports currently being seen. Any delay in exporting perishable goods risks dire consequences for businesses in Orkney, already having to cope with tight deadlines.“At the end of the most challenging of years, further financial turmoil is the last thing small businesses in the islands need heading into . The UK Government’s determination to press ahead with Brexit at any and all cost appears utterly reckless.“The very least that businesses across the Highlands and Islands deserve is support to mitigate the economic impact they face. It’s vital the UK Government now comes forward with urgent measures to head off this impending crisis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Anything that can help reduce the risk of transmission while allowing for the easing of restrictions deserves proper consideration.”Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael added: “Island communities across Scotland could benefit from greater certainty and protection from outbreakswe put in place testing at ferry terminals and airports.#I hope that the Government will take these proposals seriously as it cannot be long before we see the new iant of COVID spreading quickly across the country.#The isles often have geographic challenges relative to the rest of the UK – this is an opportunity to make use of our geographic advantages.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Almost a decade, and many awards, later Meena says, “In the beginning, we used to recommend people use the salt in salads but then we started adding it to all our food. It’s great as it doesn’t dominate the taste but just melts into and improves the flavour of all types of dishes, and you only need to use a small amount.” Indeed, feedback from a repeat customer confirms this: “I love cooking with your salt and think about its purity and provenance every time.” Meena added, “These kind of comments bring joy to our hearts!”Fellow director, Chris Watts adds, “We have always looked at the business in a holistic way, with eco-credentials at the heart of the business, from production to the packaging design to the end product. We are very proud to be part of the Scottish Food and Drink Industry, which we know will continue to thrive.”Asked how Isle of Skye Sea Salt had been affected by the Covid- pandemic, Meena replied, “Like most businesses, we’ve had a challenging year. Initially, we had to adjust and focus on our producer partners and increasing online custom until our catering and retail customers were also able to re-open in the latter half of the season. The eco-credentials, provenance, texture and taste have all made a dference to repeat orders. Every order matters to us. We are keen to promote the Isle of Skye brand. We would like to say a really big thank you to all our supporters chefs, collaborators, online and local buyers.

Every week the couple watched the majority of this beautul, local produce being exported, with very little staying in Scotland.Seaflower Skye visits Skye’s neighbouring islands of Raasay and Rona – there are trips of dferent durations and the vessel is also available to hire on a private basis.Seabirds, sea eagles, seals, porpoise, dolphin, basking sharks, orca and minke whale have all been spotted from the deck. Upon reaching the destination, a seafood feast is served.“Often, during our trips, we pass our family fishing boats,” says Ewen. “We love to allow our guests to see how the creels are hauled and where their lunch has been caught.”“This was a stressful, confusing time but we had good policies and guidelines to keep us on the right track,” Ewen added.“Our first adaptation was purchasing an antiviral fogging machine to ensure that the inside areas of the boat were as clean and safe as possible for each of our guests. It was also essential to increase the level of daily cleaning around the boat.“Maximum capacity was reduced from  guests to , and more seating and tables were provided to allow guests to spread out. Passenger access to the indoor areas was limited, which made trips more susceptible to disruption in poor weather conditions.“However, the main dference was that each group onboard had to have a private dining experience. Previously everyone would sit and get to know each other during lunch, sharing one big table.Ewen said: “I think it’s safe to say that the workload for every business has increased this year, but we do fully understand it is something that must be done in order to remain operational. We are just extremely grateful that people were able to get out on our trips and were allowed to enjoy each other’s company outdoors.”.”“We could not and would not be operational without local support. Thank you to everyone who has come out with us and supported us during this most dficult year. Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a healthy, happy New Year!”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EDINBANE-POTTERY-2.jpg","title":"optimism in the air at edinbane","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor  days, ending last week, the locally-owned business was offering  per cent of everything in stock. And, says founder Stuart Whatley, the sale period was extremely successful, thanks almost entirely to the custom of local people. Much of the firm’s range of stoneware wood-fired pottery – everything from goblets to plates to lamp bases – is surely destined for under the Christmas trees of Skye.For almost  years Edinbane Pottery has been a fixture in the commercial and cultural le of the island.“It’s hugely important for all of us to shop localpossible,” added Stuart. “The situation has improved dramatically since I came back to Skye in . It was almost impossible to get anything locally back then, even building materials. Now, apart from a few items, it#s possible to shop local for most of the things you need in le.”That context makes Stuart “pretty optimistic” about next year, whether that be in le in general or from a business point of view.“When we managed to restart in July after lockdown ended, for the rest of the summer, until the lockdowns in England, we were much busier than the same period last year,” he added. “Probably the main reason is that people couldn’t go abroad. So they weren#t spending money on holidays. But people need to buy things, and a lot of them seemed to want to buy pottery.”They also like coming in to see Stuart, we Julie, assistant Andreas Mueller and apprentice Josie Allan hard at work. It’s that kind of place, very much a working business.“People are very comfortable about coming in here,” commented Stuart. “That kind of atmosphere is very important to us.”Opening hours are am to pm, seven days a week."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3532425.jpg--.jpg?1607962919000\n","title":"lights to remember ceremony","story":"THIS year the COVID- pandemic has made it impossible for Northern Ireland Hospice to hold their traditional Lights to Remember ceremony.But they are determined to support families across Northern Ireland who have lost a loved one.This ThursdayNI Hospice will be hosting their special online ceremony and asking families to join with them and hold their own.Everyone can make it their own inidual event but to help is listed some ways below to help create your own Lights to Remember.• Put the date and time in your calendar now, Thursday  December, pm.

This year we took the decision that instead of giving out gts, that we would instead donate all this money and more to the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.”Alan explained that his grandson Tommy suffers from a condition known as Tubular Sclerosis which brings with it a range of complex special needs. “He currently benefits from support provided by the NI Children’s Hospice. This local charity provides Tommy with much needed specialist care and support to not just my grandson but to other children and their families across Northern Ireland,” explained Alan.“Each year is a struggle for charities like the NI Children’s Hospice to raise enough funds to . However, due to the global pandemic caused by Covid- this has been an even tougher year for them.”Alan said his family sees first-hand the support and specialist care that this charity provides by “how they support and care for my grandson.”“We were so grateful of all that the NI Children’s Hospice does that we as a company decided to advertise the charity on some of our vehicles,” he said.“ It is hoped that as our vehicles drive all over the UK and Ireland that this would further raise the charity’s profile by advertising the NI Children’s Hospice service and help with future donations.”Alan concluded - “I personally believe the work they do is invaluable to families and hope that by advertising their service it will lead to many more donations.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3557598.jpg--.jpg?1608802489000\n","title":"castle tower school receives 200 donation from christian publishing house","story":"PUPILS from Castle Tower School in Ballymena received an early Christmas present in the form of a donation of pound from local Christian publishing house, Timeless Publications.The money was generated from the proceeds of a Coffee Morning and Book Launch earlier this year when authors, Alistair Bates, Shirley Ballentine and Joe Boyd launched their latest manuscripts.At least % of the proceeds from the sale of every book published by Timeless is given to charity and Joe, who has Cerebral Palsy, requested that money from the sale of Trading Mindsets: God, Faith and Disability be awarded to Castle Tower.Joe said: I came through Beechgrove and then Fleming Fulton special schools as they were called back in the s so I understand how important schools like these are for the pupils and parents who benefit from them.I was especially delighted to be able to acknowledge Castle Tower as my nephew, Oscar is currently a pupil there. “It has been wonderful to see how Oscar has grown and developed, thanks in no small measure to the staff of his wonderful school.Alistair Bates added: Its a delight to be part of a team of dedicated local and international Christian authors who want to share their faith and glory God.

If these children are not engaging in education, unlike the first lockdown, there needs to be a more proactive approach from schools, Educational Welfare Service and Social Services to check on and encourage those children and families to participate in education.”It is not yet clear what impact changes to the new term would have on the transfer tests, as the first one is due to take place on January . NASUWT teaching union official Justin McCamphill said the increasing number of Covid cases shows the Executive has “lost control” of the situation. He added: “There are no excuses for not now taking every step necessary to protect the wider community, school staff and young people and their families.”Back to class: where the parties standDUP: Its Education Minister Peter Weir said schools would reopen in first week of January but Executive would keep decision under review.SINN FEIN: Backed SDLP’s recall of Assembly and seeking urgent review on re-opening of schools.SDLP: Behind recall petition to bring MLAs back to debate school safety, saying pupils, parents and teachers are extremely anxious over lack of both clarity and support.ALLIANCE: Argues that the priority should be safe, school-based learning and for a phased .UUP: Also seeking staged re-opening of schools along with increased support for safety mitigations.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirus PremiumCovid- vaccine plans in Northern Ireland overhauled to give first dose to more peopleThe Covid- vaccination programme is to be overhauled with a focus on ensuring as many people as possible receive a first dose in the coming weeks. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_da-f--ae-dcaef_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_da-f--ae-dcaef_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_da-f--ae-dcaef_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_da-f--ae-dcaef_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_da-f--ae-dcaef_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"GalleryNorthern Ireland PremiumStay home, Swann begs as Northern Ireland Covid cases hit record high with nearly half infections in - age groupHealth Minister Robin Swann has warned the public to redouble efforts to push down Covid- infection rates after shocking statistics showed a huge rise in positive cases in young people.

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas recommended that vaccinating more people with the first dose should be prioritised above offering others their second dose. “This will provide the greatest public health benefits in the short-term and save more lives,” the JCVI said on Wednesday. Health Minister Robin Swann subsequently submitted an urgent written statement to the Assembly in which he said: “I fully agree and endorse this advice and from early January the main focus of the programme in Northern Ireland will be on ensuring as many people as possible receive their first dose of a Covid- vaccine.”The advice relates to both the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which has already been administered to , people here, and the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, which received approval from regulators in the UK on Wednesday. Read MoreA landmark moment: Irish professor hails approval of new weapon in Covid- fightIreland to re-enter Level  restrictions for at least a month – TaoiseachCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Six further deaths and record , cases reportedWithin hours of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency giving the green light to the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, local GP surgeries began ringing patients over the age of  to ensure vaccination clinics can begin on Monday. The vaccine will be offered to the oldest patients and front line healthcare workers first.It will then be rolled out to the over-s, over-s and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. Dr Laurence Dorman, chair of the Royal College of GPs in Northern Ireland, said he hopes there will be a signicant drop in cases by April. “We are delighted and I am hoping that I will be getting the vaccine myself on Monday,” he said. “Given the timescale in which we are working, GP surgeries are going to be ringing patients rather than sending out letters. “For that reason we would ask that patients don’t contact us, we will be in touch to let them know when to come along for their vaccination. “We will be encouraging people, even after they have had their second dose, to continue to adhere to public health guidance relating to hands, face, space. “Restrictions can be lted according to infection rates as opposed to the number of people who have been vaccinated, although there should be a correlation between the two. “I would hope there will be a signicant dference by Eastertime.“All of this does mean that there will be some disruption to normal services, so the likes of blood pressure checks might be affected, but we would ask everyone for understanding and patience.”The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine has been earmarked for use by GP surgeries due to the fact that it can be stored in a normal fridge. For this reason it is much easier to distribute and store than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which must be kept at a temperature of minus  degrees. GP practices have put in place plans to vaccinate patients in the coming months, with clinics being held in surgeries, recreation facilities and town halls. Officials have warned that the speed at which the vaccination programme — the largest ever undertaken by the NHS — can be completed depends on availability of the vaccines. However, with , new cases recorded here over the past seven days, pressure is mounting to ensure as many people as possible get the vaccine in the coming weeks. Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw said: “The approval of the Oxford vaccine and further ongoing indications of the signicant benefit provided by a single dose mean that it is right for Northern Ireland to sht strategy to ensuring as many people get an initial dose as quickly as possible.“By maximising the number of people, particularly with clinical vulnerability due to age group or underlying condition, who receive this initial protection, we will be able to move forward faster towards the end goal.”Belfast Related ContentWorldA landmark moment: Irish professor hails approval of new weapon in Covid- fightThe Dublin-born professor who has been leading the development team behind the AstraZeneca Covid- vaccine at Oxford University has hailed a “landmark moment” after it was officially approved for use in the UK.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandIreland to re-enter Level  restrictions for at least a month – TaoiseachIreland will face Level  coronavirus restrictions for at least a month, the Taoiseach has announced.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Six further deaths and record , cases reportedThere have been six more deaths related to Covid- in Northern Ireland, according to the Department of Health.

The SDLP will ensure that pupils, parents and teachers have the answers and assurances they need.”“People have the right to knowit is safe for pupils and teachers toto school next week and the SDLP will ensure that the Minister for Education can no longer ignore taking action.”Justin McCamphill, NASUWT National Official Northern Ireland, said Tuesday’s figures were “shocking” and the fact schools are still scheduled to re-pen as normal was “farcical”.“The figures released by the Department of Health today are truly shocking,” he said.“ cases in  hours far exceeds any previous daily total. Peter Weir’s position that schools should open as normal from January  grows more farcical by the day.”“With the medical experts forecasting a surge in mid-January it is more obvious than ever before that restarting schools next week is going to have detrimental consequences for the health service and will lead to further transmission among young people and school staff.”He said the current plan to introduce blended learning later in January was “too little to late”.“Action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe in mid-January,” he said.“Moving to blended learning from January  will be too little too late”“The NASUWT is calling on all Executive parties to act to protect workers in schools, young people and the wider community.

About % of all reports end up having a straightforward explanation, he said.It#s the few that don#t that are really intriguing. But the guy claiming to be dropped off at Bangor Marina, that#s very dficult to explain. We often wonderthis is people imagining things, perhaps more of a psychological effect than astronomical. But in a population of millions of people, you are going to have a few unusual incidents.He said factors like the time of day, witnesses or presence of CCTV would normally be the first steps in debunking things.I noticed that the PSNI didn#t investigate any of these incidents, he added.They probably have higher priorities, but you never know.He said his magazine often received calls from those who were convinced they had seen flying saucers, which could often be explained as being planets, astral fireballs or satellites.Mars, for instance, was close to the Earth this year, it was brighter than all the stars in the sky, he explained. Then we had Venus appearing in the morning sky.Even pilots have been taken in by that, thinking that an aircraft is following them when really it#s just the planet Venus.An increase in space traffic, he added, such as tech billionaire Elon Musk launching thousands of Starlink satellites, had made the night sky busier than ever.But one confirmed visitor from outer space came in , when a fragment of a meteorite broke off over Sprucefield Police Station and burned through the roof, with a larger fragment landing miles away on farmland.Recalling a close encounter of his own, Mr Moore added: I remember when I was a kid in Dublin getting interested in astronomy I saw this very bright star-like object crossing silently over the Wicklow Mountains. I knew it was probably a satellite, but I recall feeling physically scared that it might be aliens.I don#t think I#m a crackpot, but I was impressionable and it did take me a few days to convince myself it was a satellite.If that happens to someone who is interested in astronomy, you can only imagine how a normal person would be affected. So that#s always brought home to me that you shouldn#t ridicule them, you should just try and explain it to them.Chris McMurray is chairperson of the Northern Ireland UFO Society, a small group of enthusiasts established in  with the aim of promoting awareness of extraterrestrial le.He said reports of sightings of unknown aerial phenomena had increased lately, with the most common places being around the Cavehill and Black Mountain area, as well as the Mourne region.A common theme that we notice is that sightings of anomalous lights tend to be seen near certain geographical features, such as the granite mountains and other areas of a crystalline nature, he explained.This could be because, as widely accepted by ufologists and paranormal investigators alike, these can help amply the natural energies of the Earth.As for the guy who said he was dropped off at Bangor...

However, the DUP, the only main party here that backed Brexit, said it will oppose the deal because the orce settlement imposes customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Read MoreMark Bain:OpinionDUP overplayed its hand, and no amount of fudge can cover its hubrisCritics have urged the DUP to accept the outcome as a result of its actions over Brexit. Ulster Unionist peer Lord Empey argued that the Northern Ireland Protocol came about after the DUP initially indicated acceptance of it.The protocol, part of the Withdrawal Agreement, was designed to avoid the need for border checks on the island of Ireland when the UK leaves the EU. It achieved that by creating new customs and regulatory processes on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain - the so-called Irish Sea border and DUP leader Arlene Foster#s blood red line that she vowed not to cross.Lord Empey said Boris Johnson#s amendments to the protocol were unveiled in October , and included border inspection points, and an ongoing role for the European Court in Northern Ireland#s affairs.Crucially, no such rules or European Court involvement would apply to Great Britain, he said.I pointed out that immediately this document was released, Arlene Foster and her DUP colleagues endorsed these proposals, describing them as #a serious and sensible way forward#. Lord Dodds didn#t like what I was saying and accused me of telling lies. I offered on a radio programme to withdraw my claims and apologisemy statement had been factually incorrect. Needless to say, I have received no evidence that I was factually incorrect. So, at the risk of annoying Nigel and his colleagues once more, I say again that on  October , the DUP endorsed a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, with all the add-ons of Border Inspection posts etc.As a result of this decision, Boris Johnson was able to go to Brussels and Dublin and claim that he had unionist consent for his plan.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood told Radio Ulster he believed Brexit marked the beginning of the end for the UK.I think unionists need to think very carefully about where the DUP have led them. They#ve led them into a situation where we#re going to have an economic border in the Irish Sea.They have been sold a pup by the Brexiteers and they have put themselves and their community in a very, very dficult position.DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said the party would be voting against the deal as it didn#t mitigate the impact of the protocol on Northern Ireland. He said Mr Johnson had relinquished on his promises not to treat Northern Ireland dferently, and forced his deal through.He added: Colum Eastwood needn#t think he can re-write history and put the blame on others, when he and his party argued vocerously against having the checks that will now take place at ports in Northern Ireland.

Christmas party.The official added: “To sum up, the case for extending a joint invitation to Sinn Fein is irresistible.“But, given the likely reaction in some quarters, I wish to be certain that ministers know all the implications, and are content that I should proceed with inviting a few leading Sinn Fein players along with other leading Northern Irish politicians.”The Northern Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue had also reflected on those who worked at Maryfield, the historic files said.The Government archives quoted from a debate: “Even the prosperous burghers of Holywood were so outraged at the Anglo-Irish Agreement in  that the Maryfield bunker had to be virtually the most fortied place in Northern Ireland, and that remains the case today.”It said civil servants working

make small talk over the canapes, the file said.“But these people never – and never will- have any direct contact with the ordinary, decent people of Northern Ireland.”NIO official JR Fisher noted in

Mr Blair and Taoiseach Bertie Ahern were among those lauded for their roles in bringing about the peace accord in  after years of The Troubles in Northern Ireland. Documents on Anglo-Irish relations from Mr Blair#s first few weeks in office, following New Labour#s surge to victory in May , show a meeting between the two men signalled an intent to bring peace. A briefing note from Robin Cook, then Foreign Secretary, to Mr Blair said: Your meeting with the Taoiseach on July  was inevitably dominated by discussion of Northern Ireland. But there was agreement in principle to developing the wider relationship. Mr Cook acknowledged that a nationalist government would likely be less instinctively committed to improving the relationship between Ireland and the UK. But he said having Mr Ahern as the Fianna Fail party#s leader gave genuine cause for optimism. Ahern is a pragmatist, Mr Cook wrote. He has spoken privately to our Ambassador and in public of the possibility of developing a new era in UK Irish relations. Better so-called #East West# relations have intrinsic value and will improve the climate for our exchanges with the Irish over Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement set the way for peaceful powersharing in Northern Ireland.It was backed by % of voters in a referendum in Northern Ireland while % voted in favour of it in the Republic.It became one of the defining achievements of the Blair years. Before the signing of the deal, he referred to the #Hand of History# being on his shoulder.The new Stormont Assembly met for the first time in July  and David Trimble and Seamus Mallon were elected as First and deputy First Ministers.In , on the th anniversary of the deal, Mr Blair and Mr Ahern spoke at a conference in Belfast.Mr Blair said the  deal took real courage by Northern Ireland parties. He added that for all its faults, the Good Friday Agreement was worth doing and worth keeping.Mr Ahern said: The art of politics is compromise, you can#t make progress without compromise.Belfast Most ReadUnforgettable photographs from #s big moments in Northern IrelandDUP told to face up to its role in creating border in Irish SeaCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Six further deaths and record , cases reportedThe full list of Northern Ireland recipients for  New Year HonoursBelfast rugby team#s founder accused of sexual assaultLatest Northern IrelandSurvivor of Kingsmill shootings dedicates honour to those who supported him#People are putting themselves at unnecessary risks#, says Mourne Mountain Rescue Team as they respond to five calls in one dayMy MBE is dedicated to the  men who were massacred at Kingsmill, says sole survivor Alan BlackFirefighting champion of transgender rights in Northern Ireland is awarded MBEThe full list of Northern Ireland recipients for  New Year HonoursLatest from Belfast Minneapolis police fatally shoot man during traffic stopChina accuses US of show of force with Taiwan Strait passagePremier League confident in Covid protocols as season continuesChrissy Teigen explains why she has given up drinkingAllan McGregor: Winning at St Mirren means more than reaching milestone,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, a civil servant advised that the issue of the Aboriginal head was not of major political signicance.Mr Adams wrote personally to Mr Haughey over the issue on February , .I believe that the refusal to do so , over a five-year period, demonstrates a total insensitivity to the spiritual values of the aboriginal people of Australia, Mr Adams wrote.This is being interpreted as racist by those people.The Irish Government was briefed that the RCSI decided tothe remains to Australia.In a letter dated March  to the Taoiseach, the Aboriginal Centre invited him to attend a handing over ceremony for the remains at the Australian Embassy on March , a memo outlined.The embassy had no knowledge of any such ceremony which, in the light of the removal of the remains from Ireland, does not now arise.Following the decision of the RCSI to give back the remains, the embassy are not anxious to add to the extensive publicity which has already been given to this whole issue and thereby embarrass the college even further. This seems to be an eminently sensible approach.Belfast Most ReadUnforgettable photographs from #s big moments in Northern IrelandDUP told to face up to its role in creating border in Irish SeaCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Six further deaths and record , cases reportedThe full list of Northern Ireland recipients for  New Year HonoursBelfast rugby team#s founder accused of sexual assaultLatest Republic of IrelandA landmark moment: Irish professor hails approval of new weapon in Covid- fightIreland to re-enter Level  restrictions for at least a month – TaoiseachState of pandemic ‘urgent and high-risk’, says HSE chiefMan dies after being shot by gardaiLured to death: Mother and eldest son were enticed to come back to isolated Kanturk farmLatest from Belfast Minneapolis police fatally shoot man during traffic stopChina accuses US of show of force with Taiwan Strait passagePremier League confident in Covid protocols as season continuesChrissy Teigen explains why she has given up drinkingAllan McGregor: Winning at St Mirren means more than reaching milestone,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s unlikely Ballyronan had ever seen anything like it. Tickets for the event cost pound. and, even allowing for inflation, represented real value for the sheer quality of the acts on show. Rory Gallagher was the headline act in the festival’s second year, and would ultimately prove to be the last, as it never ed to the Loughshore. While shortlived, the festival boasted a stellar line up, with a host of rock talent making their way to the south Derry village. googletag.cmd.push The hugely talented Pat McManus remembers the gig well. Among them was Pat McManus, lead guitarist and fiddle player in Mama’s Boys, who were second on the bill behind Gallagher on that late July evening  years ago. “We were heading off on a European tour and it was seen as a good warm-up gig for us to do as well. It was a good festival gig to get us into tip-top shape,” he told the County Derry Post. “We had an album out - Growing Up the Hard Way – and we would have been there to promote it. They must have thought they’d have the two Irish bands to headline – Rory and ourselves. googletag.cmd.push “Plus, to be on the same bill as Rory Gallagher was fantastic, we always jumped at the chance to share the stage with Rory. “He was one of my heroes growing up, and still is. He was marvellous. From that point of view, it was great. “We’d shared the stage a couple of times with Rory in Germany and ious places like that, but this was the first time on home soil, which we were delighted about.”  While McManus, a native of Derrylin in County Fermanagh, was unfamiliar with Ballyronan, Mama’s Boys did have a link to the maiden festival of .     “Magnum was the headline act the year before and Mark Stanway, their keyboard player, has been in my solo band quite a few times,” he said. “This kind of festival wasn’t too popular in Ireland, but in Germany and other places we toured, you would get lots of little villages putting on festivals. “The attendance could be anywhere from , to , people, it just depends. It was a brave thing to do. It wasn’t going to be Dalymount or Macroom that Rory had done in the past. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play. “Rory was an international rock star, so to see him on your own soil, so close to Lough Neagh was an incredible thing. You wouldn’t have seen much of Rory playing that kind of festival.” While the presence of the Ballyshannon-born Gallagher was undoubtedly the festival’s main draw, a host of other stars were strewn throughout the supporting acts. Don Airey of Deep Purple shared the stage with Mamas Boys in . Deep Purple’s Don Airey, who also played with Whitesnake, Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne, guested with Mama’s Boys, themselves an internationally supported band. Magnum’s Mark Stanley was also involved with the legendary Phil Lynott’s Grand Slam, while there was also a surprise appearance from one of Northern Ireland’s finest rock musicians. “The legendary Vivian Campbell, who now plays with Def Leppard, made a guest appearance with his old band, Sweet Savage, so that added more excitement on the day,” said McManus. “It was a wonderful afternoon’s music. People were rather spoiled. His pedigree as a musician from Northern Ireland was second to none. Everybody was very excited to see Vivian there.” The eclectic nature of the festival’s line up saw rock fans from across the country converging on the shores of Lough Neagh. Larne native Gerry McNally, current sub-editor of the Folk and Tumble website, had travelled down from the east coast for Rory’s gig, having also been in attendance the previous year. “I can remember crossing a couple of fields and it was right beside the Lough,” he said. “It was a beautul venue too, right on the shores of Lough Neagh and both years they had fireworks at the end of each night. The line ups were good both years too. “You were luckysomeone came to the Ulster Hall or the King’s Hall. Gigs would have been quite rare back then, you were mostly going to Dublin for them. Gerry McNallys ticket stub for the pound. gig. “I was only getting into Rory’s music, but I’d never seen or heard anything like it. He was still in good health back then and was just a ball of energy. “Sadly, that was the one and only time I saw him. Looking back, I wish I was as familiar with his music then as I am now. I would have appreciated it a lot more. “At the time, I’d never seen anything like it. I was living in the moment, taking it in and just being awestruck. His playing was amazing. “The only other band I really remember were Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts. They didn’t take themselves too seriously, but they were a good, fun band.” Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts may not have been Gerry’s go-to, but for young fan Darren Seaton, they were the main draw. “Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts was the other band I was specically there for,” said the Belfast native, who was  at the time. “You’d always see them listed in Kerrang, they were really good, but we were there all day. You got dropped off in the morning and you get picked up afterwards. Young rock fan Darren Seaton made the trip from Belfast for a glimpse at Dumpys Rusty Nuts. “Our trip was run by Makin’ Tracks in Belfast, they used to be the main record store. You would have got your gig tickets and bus tickets and then met at Glengall Street for the bus. “The day we were there, there was also a band from New Zealand that nobody had ever heard of. I’ve no idea how they got on the bill, but they were touring round Europe. “They had a video camera with them and were basically filming us all telling them to f**k off. “Rory, obviously, was legendary. I didn’t really know a lot about him, because being , I was more into Bon Jovi and stuff at the time,” he said. “I hadn’t realised the epicness of what was in front of me and the fact I wouldn’t get to see him live again.” Despite the profanity towards the unwitting visitors from the southern hemisphere, Darren and his friends managed to make their way to the backstage area. “There was a band playing called DARE, whose frontman, Darren Wharton, played keyboard with Thin Lizzy,” he said. Darren Wharton, formerly of Thin Lizzy, fronted DARE at the Rock at the Lough festival. “We were talking to their merch guy, who had a table behind a wire fence. He was on one side in the ‘backstage’ area and we were on the other, passing money through the fence for t-shirts. “He gave us his pass and told us to go into the dining hall, so me and a couple of mates went down and had dinner with the drummer and the bass player there!” Musicians coming to play in Northern Ireland had become a rare breed throughout the Troubles, with many acts choosing to avoid coming to Belfast in particular. Despite its idyllic setting on the Loughshore, the Ballyronan festival was not immune to the threat of violence. “We got down the road to Ballyronan to be told we couldn’t get in yet, because there was a bomb scare and a Chinook flying overhead,” recalled Darren. “It was a hoax, but we were sitting on the bus for about two hours outside Ballyronan until they cleared it and we were all allowed in.” News of the bomb scare also filtered through to the bands, all of whom had shown a steely determination to perform. “I remember something about that, but it obviously was a prank, because no one passed any remarks,” said Pat McManus. “And evenit was, we were going to go ahead and play anyway because people had paid in there and wanted to see the bands. “They [the police] were probably wondering what the hell was going on with all the people gathering – it might have been that more than anything . “We were determined, come hell or high water, we were going to get on that stage and play and the rest of the artists that day felt the same.” Local rock star Vivian Campbell made a surprise appearance at the festival. Despite a hugely ambitious line-up, the festival only lasted for two years. Although a beautul venue, a lack of marketing and issues with accessibility undermined its success. “I’d say there was somewhere in the region of , people there,” said Pat McManus. “People didn’t know about it either and others were a bit sceptical, but from looking out from where I was on the stage, that’s the amount I would have guessed. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play.” One of the fortunate, Darren Seaton, sums it up well. “It’s strange that a random place like Ballyronan had these two big festivals two years in a row. It was a great day out.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The pupils from Long Tower PS visited Alexander House sheltered accommodation and the House in the Wells homeless shelterfor men with addiction issues every year to sing carols.  But this year, due to the ongoing coronavirus restrictions, they had to think of a dferent way to bring festive greetings to their neighbours. The teachers spoke to the pupils about the ways that Christmas would be dferent this year and how people were finding new ways of staying connected. googletag.cmd.push And after getting their thinking caps on, the children decided that although the carol services couldnt go ahead they could give cards and drawings instead. School principal Joyce Logue explained: We always talk to the children about the importance of helping others. This year we spoke to the pupils about how they would feelthey were separated from their loved ones this Christmas, but with the focus on what we still can do, rather than what we cant. They helped come up with the idea of making the drawings. Long Tower PS has strong links with groups in the local community, which stretch back many years. googletag.cmd.push This year they also decided to give gts to Owen Mor care home in Culmore, where several members of staff have relatives. Its very important to us to stay connected to everyone around us and the children get a lot from it too, Mrs Logue said. It reminds them to always think of others and the importance of kindness. Last week, the pupils were able to visit Alexander House, the House in the Wells to deliver their drawings without going inside. They were really delighted with the drawings and the children were so happy to deliver them, added Mrs Logue.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Under the mentorship of Richard McBride and Victoria Townsend, six Year  pupils from Foyle College recently participated in the Livery Academy Awards. Richard is a former pupil and current governor of the Derry school, whose back- ground is in law, whilst Victoria is the founder of the London Academy of Bespoke. Their joint expertise and business acumen provided the pupils with the perfect marriage of guidance and knowledge. Traditionally hosted in Merchant Taylors’ Hall, London, this year the pupils joined the competition virtually, proposing the launch of their Covid- inspired product, Care Cog. googletag.cmd.push During months of preparatory work alongside Richard and Victoria, the team developed a business plan and created a product prototype, before presenting their Care Cog to Merchant Taylors‘ judging , Lady Harding, Nick Hewer and Jana Mackintosh. The team’s presentation was excellent and they coped well with the judges’ questions. However, London- based all-girls St Saviour’s and St Olave’s School were selected as winners. The Foyle pupils were awarded pound, to gt to their chosen river rescue charity, Foyle Search and Rescue. The pupils selected the local charity because, they said, it is a grassroots charity whose work makes valuable contributions within their local community. googletag.cmd.push Barry Duffy, from Foyle College, praised all those involved. “The pupils really benefited from their participation in the Livery Academy Awards and are proud that their journey will also help to support others through the Merchant Taylors’ donation.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Under the mentorship of Richard McBride and Victoria Townsend, six Year  pupils from Foyle College recently participated in the Livery Academy Awards. Richard is a former pupil and current governor of the Derry school, whose back- ground is in law, whilst Victoria is the founder of the London Academy of Bespoke. Their joint expertise and business acumen provided the pupils with the perfect marriage of guidance and knowledge. Traditionally hosted in Merchant Taylors’ Hall, London, this year the pupils joined the competition virtually, proposing the launch of their Covid- inspired product, Care Cog. googletag.cmd.push During months of preparatory work alongside Richard and Victoria, the team developed a business plan and created a product prototype, before presenting their Care Cog to Merchant Taylors‘ judging , Lady Harding, Nick Hewer and Jana Mackintosh. The team’s presentation was excellent and they coped well with the judges’ questions. However, London- based all-girls St Saviour’s and St Olave’s School were selected as winners. The Foyle pupils were awarded pound, to gt to their chosen river rescue charity, Foyle Search and Rescue. The pupils selected the local charity because, they said, it is a grassroots charity whose work makes valuable contributions within their local community. googletag.cmd.push Barry Duffy, from Foyle College, praised all those involved. “The pupils really benefited from their participation in the Livery Academy Awards and are proud that their journey will also help to support others through the Merchant Taylors’ donation.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Writing in his new book, The Invisible Game, the two-time All-Ireland winning midfielder dedicated the battleground chapter to players he came up against in the midfield sectors on pitches across Ireland. Walsh highlighted nearly  players, which included Enda Muldoon and Anthony Tohill, before summing up to give his top three. Brian McGilligan, supported by Ger Lynch, in action against Andrew Jarmon of Australia during the  International Rules series in Croke Park  McGilligan, McGrane and McCreery were among those I admired most, and McGilligan was the best in my opinion. He had excellent footwork and was such a physical specimen. He churned it out consistently, doing the simple things right. He was courageous and consistent but most of all he was caring, Walsh said. googletag.cmd.push He brought it every day so that his teammates could get the limelight. Once Derry won, he didnt care who was getting the love from the terraces or the media, but he was the heartbeat of the team.

Fionn McLaughlinfrom Magherafelt has been kart-racing since the tender age of three and has amassed a range of trophies and titles, racing across Ireland, the UK and Europe. This summer, he caught the attention of top Italian talent scout, Dino Chiesa, who has discovered some of the world’s best drivers, including Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. Invited by Chiesa to race with his team in Italy, Fionn travelled there in September, where he finished in the top ten in every race. This was despite driving on a new track against more experienced and older competitors, with around  drivers participating in each race. googletag.cmd.push “At the time I didn’t really think about it,” said Fionn. “I just wanted to get on the track. It was great but I didn’t want to get too happy in case nothing comes out of it.” His dad, Martin McLaughlin, said Fionn performed “really well” in Italy, where he spent a week driving at the Adria International Raceway. “Fionn did so well they invited him back to another race weekend, at the Castelletto Circuit,” said Martin. “The team he raced with was Dino Chiesa’s World Championship-winning race team, Kart Republic. He won a race, finished second in the two finals and was fighting for the lead in both of those finals. googletag.cmd.push “He was one of the fastest drivers most of the weekend. He’s more than proved himself as a talented driver – now he just needs someone to back him to continue to the next level.” Indeed, sporting talent alone is, unfortunately, not enough for a young racing driver to succeed at World Championship level. Top scouts might want to work with Fionn and will put up hundreds of thousands of pounds to do so, but they also expect their drivers to provide some of the funding. This, said Martin, is impossible for an ordinary family to do, as it requires an investment of up to pound, from Fionn’s side.     “Each team is prepared to invest around  percent but they need you to fund the rest,” he said. “That  percent is a lot for a working-class family to stump up, along with all the travel costs on top of that. He’s at a point now where it’s just not possible to move to world-level without sponsors.” As well as the interest from Chiesa, Fionn has also attracted the attention of a few other racing teams, who have enquired about working with him in . Unless he gets some sponsors, however, he could well miss out on these opportunities. A spokesperson from a world-level team responsible for helping launch the careers of more than a few F champions, said they had seen Fionn’s potential and could “do a great job with him.” “We are ready to invest a lot of money in him,” they added. “You have a proposal in hand from the Factory Team that made Hamilton and Verstappen win in Karting, one of the greatest manufacturers in the world.” “It would mean a lot to get sponsors because then I could compete in other countries and work with these teams, said Fionn. Although COVID- restricted racing, like many things, this year, Fionn still managed to enjoy a good season in . He raced in both Europe and the UK, including the UK’s biggest circuit, the MSA Kartmasters Grand Prix, which has seen the likes of George Russell and Lewis Hamilton race. In September he also competed at the IAME Euro Series in Essay, France, where he qualied pole position for the final and went on to win both the pre-final and final races in round two in Castelletto, Italy. Training every day before school and whenever  he can fit it in, Fionn is dedicated to pursuing his dream career, although he is realistic too. “If I don’t make it as a racer then I have to make sure I’ve worked hard on my schoolwork,” he said. “My biggest challenge as a driver is to consistently get good results and then hopefully the right people will notice me.” If you’re interested in sponsoring Fionn in his karting career, you can contact Martin McLaughlin at martin@infomcl or call .   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry News understands that -year old has been in talks with Declan Devine about ato the club in the New Year. Parkhouse spent the entirety of the  season at Derry City, making  appearances in all competitions, and scoring  goals as well as chipping in with  assists. The striker, who was on a loan deal from Sheffield United, ed to the Blades at the start of  and signed a new contract with the Premiership club before being sent out on loan to then League Two side Stevenage, where he made four appearances, scoring two goals. googletag.cmd.push Parkhouse then joined National League side Hartlepool but despite a promising start there, he struggled for a starting place. He made  appearances overall, with just four starts and scored just two goals before ending his loan spell early tohome to Ireland. Hartlepool manager Dave Challinor was disappointed that the move didnt work out for either party. “I spoke to him last week and he’s had some issues off the pitch at home with family not being well,” Challinor said. “We’ve allowed him to go back to Ireland to be at home with his family and spend some time with them. He’ll then go back to Sheffield United in the new year when his loan is up. googletag.cmd.push “We thought we really had someone who could be that goal getter for us. But with things like international duty and little niggles and that, it just hasn’t transpired. “Hopefully he goes back and potentially goes out on another loan. He certainly has the ability to score goals at this level. It just hasn’t worked for him here.”  Brandywell  Parkhouse was a huge hit in his one season at the Brandywell, forming a devastating attacking partnership with Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, with both players chapping in with  goals combined as City qualied for Europe and reached the EA Sports League Cup final.     A move back to the Brandywell could well suit both parties here, with the striker keen to put a dficult year behind him, whilst Declan Devine is on the look out for a new attacking line up, having had great dficulty in replacing both Parkhouse and Uzokwe ever since. Devine signed Norwegian striker Tim Nilsen at the start of the year, but the player left the club after just  games with no goals. Ibrahim Meite was brought in during the summer and scored just one goal, a penalty at Shelbourne, in his  appearances. James Akintunde, who could stillto the Brandywell next season, was Citys most prolic forward in , scoring  goals in  appearances, but still nowhere near the numbers that Parkhouse or Uzokwe managed in the  season. Parkhouse is still under contract at Bramall Lane, but Devine and Derry City are hopeful of working out a deal to bring the young striker back to his home town club on a permanent deal, rather than a loan period as was the case previously. There has just been one new addition at the Brandywell so far in the close season, with Danny Lafferty ing to the club on a two-year contract, while Ciaran Coll is the only player to have signed a new deal amongst the remaining playing staff, which was also a two-year deal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half. I canrsquot praise the boys enough, our bench helped us over the line and it was a superbly taken goal from Francis.Meath: J Fagan, R Ennis, H Cottrell, E Cole, P Connelly, J Coyne, K OrsquoGorman, J Cole , E Grehan, R Byas , J Meagher , S Donnelly, R Fagan , J Harris, S Cunningham .Subs: M Cullyfor Harris, E McCormack for Donnelly, D Darby for Cunningham.Down: P Smyth, J Higgins, D Mallon, J McCollum, N Kelly, C Savage, F McFall, R OrsquoNeill, J Duggan, F Turpin , T McGrattan , M Dorrian , O Coulter , J Clarke, F Caldwell .Subs: S Milliganfor OrsquoNeill, F MacManus for McGrattan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan woman’s releases debut children’s book  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman has joined the ranks of childrenrsquos book authors.Kathleen McPolin, who is a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant in Downpatrick SureStart, has just published the first in an exciting new series featuring the farm-based adventures of Boomer and Blanky.Produced by Shanway Press in Belfast, the books are aimed at encouraging early yearsrsquo interest in reading and promote new vocabulary.Part of Kathleenrsquos work with SureStart over the past  years has been helping to facilitate rhythm, rhyme, and story sessions each week for children - with their parents or s.ldquoBecause this age group have short attention spans, I find the books that really capture their attention are the colourful ones with few words but yet have a story to tell, explained Kathleen.After finding it dficult to get the right books to cover everyday topics such as transport, weather, clothes, and food in a short-story style, Kathleen decided to create her own.ldquoChildren love to see the same characters appear regularly in their books. They become familiar with the characters and enjoy the new vocabulary in each story. My stories are intentionally short with the aim of retaining the childrsquos interest.ldquoThe language is at the childrsquos level, Kathleen continued. ldquoI have used repetitive language because this is a great way to encourage early words and sounds.

He had lived in London most of his le, leaving Saul at the age of .Engaged to be married, but struggling to find the right ring, he found himself back in Northern Ireland on business he decided to call on his uncle Will, his only surviving Irish relative.It was the eve of the longest night of the year, a few days before Christmas, and a bitterly cold late afternoon. On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door. She ripped of her shoe and attacked the window screen. She turned to Jim. lsquoWhat do you know about fixing cars rsquo Jim shrugged.The bride pierced him with fiery blue eyes.lsquoAre you going to a fancy dress party rsquo he asked. lsquoI am going to be married,rsquo she replied. She banged the roof of the car with her shoe a number of times, hopping about attempting to put the shoe back on to her foot. lsquoLet me give you a lt,rsquo suggested Jim.In order to steady herself the bride hung on to Jimrsquos shoulder and finally won the battle of the shoe. lsquoThought yoursquod never ask.rsquo She lashed out at the motor with her fist, missed, spun around and fell into Jimrsquos arms.Saul Church was only a mile away. The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man. The bride jumped to her feet. Well done.rsquo She kissed him on the nose. lsquoItrsquos a lovely ring,rsquo said an embarrassed Jim. lsquoI am engaged, havenrsquot got the ring yet.rsquoThe bride grabbed the ring and placed it on to her finger lsquoThen you had best get a move on, you donrsquot want to lose her.rsquo She took out a hanky and blew her nose with considerable force.Jim noticed in the torch light that she was muddy and dishevelled, her face and red hair littered with spots of mud.lsquoYou donrsquot have a driver rsquo he asked. lsquoSmelly little man, didnrsquot trust him, kicked him out a mile or so back,rsquo she replied. Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring. Where did you get yours rsquo Jim inquired.                                                                    lsquoYou like it rsquo asked his odd passenger as she struggled in vain to apply lipstick. Jim smiled and nodded his head. The bride inspected her ring lsquoItrsquos very nice, expensive,rsquo she boasted. lsquoWas it handed down through your fianceacutersquos family rsquo The bride didnrsquot reply. lsquoI live in London, I am visiting my uncle Will, do you know him, Will OrsquoBrien rsquoJim noticed that the young lady was gazing out of the window, looking slightly lost, she was not in the mood for conversation. The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

The pupils I spoke to were confident and articulate users of the digital resources at their disposal. The school has developed effective support links during the pandemic to support distance learning.St Josephrsquos also received a special recognition badge last month for Cyber Resilience and Internet Safety, becoming the third primary school in Northern Ireland to be awarded this badge.The school had completed a pioneering education initiative developed to encourage online safety and cyber resilience amongst pupils in schools.The assessment report noted: lsquoSt Josephrsquos is a dynamic school which has a careful, considered and planned approach to developing and delivering a safe and secure digital technology learning environment for their pupils and have fully engaged their parental community in this development.rsquoPrincipal Laura Fitzsimons said: ldquoWe are delighted to have been awarded these prestigious titles which highlight the schoolrsquos continual investment in resources and training.ldquoWe are very pleased and proud of our teachers, student digital leaders and all our pupils for their commitment to digital learning.ldquoIt was particularly pleasing to receive this positive news in light of the challenging times which we are currently living in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Talking.jpg","title":"Talking about coercive control  ","story":"TODAY there are mothers and their children from the wider Downpatrick area living in refuges run by Womenrsquos Aid.There may be more over the Christmas and New Year period as the festive time can be a dangerous time for people living with their abuser.The prospect of a six-week lockdown means that demand for help is also set to increase as Womenrsquos Aid supported , women and children during the last lockdown.Eileen Murphy, chief executive officer of the charity, has in her -plus years of working provided support to women from the Downpatrick area.Based in Newry, she works closely with the South Eastern Domestic Violence Partnership run by the local Health Trust and in partnership with other agencies, including the PSNI.ldquoOur refuges run at % capacity but we also work with many women who never stay in our refuges, said Eileen.She is all too aware of the worry and fear that some women will be experiencing over the holiday period.ldquoMothers will be trying to make the best Christmas Day possible for their children, no matter the situation. They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever. But I always say to that isI woke up tomorrow morning to see my partner battered or bruised and he told me I had done it last night with drink in me, would I take a drink again  Yet these guys continue to do it.ldquoThere is no doubt about that we work with traumatised women and children and people try and deal with it in many dferent ways.

There were howls of protest from Dublin when the UK suspended Stormont in .And that is the pattern: republicans misbehave, and everyone is punished. The Castlereagh break-in, Stormont spying, the Northern Bank robbery, murders of Robert McCartney, Paul Quinn, Kevin McGuigan. Nothing leads to sanction.Sinn Fein were allowed to collapse Stormont in  until they got their political demands, which of course they did.Meanwhile, Tony Blair launched a secret IRA On The Runs scheme. Yet elderly soldiers face homicide trials for shootings in the Troubles that were not pre-meditated.A recent Independent Reporting Commission did not even mention a security view that the IRA still gathers intelligence.It is a far reaching, indeed never ending scandal.And nothing changes. The Lambeth Palace secret talks suggested that the government is keen both to end veteran trials and to placate republicans on legacy.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

He said that Mr Warner’s response had been partly ‘encouraging’, but ‘also rather confused ... so much so that I thought it best to check with him again yesterday as to what it was he thought he had been saying to me’”.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I did labour the point that in a situation where, as we both agreed, the balance of change was likely to be in a nationalist direction ... then no amount of would-be counterveilling sops to unionistswould be worth anythingthe unionists still thought they were on that proverbial slippery slope …”.He said “in policy terms, Dr Mowlam should not frighten us she has enormous assets as a person her heart is in the right place she is no fool. But having just passed her driving test, she may be asked to drive in a Grand Prix. Everything may depend on her team getting her round the firstbends …”.Some  months earlier Dr Mowlam and her Labour team met the NIO’s top official, Sir John Chilcott. Sir John said he found them “already remarkably well informed”.Civil servant Peter Bell said that Mo Mowlam’s aide asked himthe RUC would uphold the law. He said: “Looking meaningfully at me, Mr Warner asked whether the RUC could be relied upon to uphold the law  My response was that in terms of loyalty and discipline, the answer was an unqualied ‘yes’. “Whether they would be able to do so,their resources were stretched whether at Drumcree or at similar disturbances throughout NI, raised another problem – including a greater reliance on the Army.”FROM THE DECLASSIFEID FILES:Irish Government did secret deal with Gerry Adams to free IRA prisoners days after  ceasefire, declassied file revealsIrish Government deliberately did not condemn ceasefire murders by IRA in  to keep Sinn Féin on board, declassied file revealsUlster Farmers’ Union lobbied for ‘unequivocal’ government statement on beef safety – months before BSE link to humans, declassied file showsMo Mowlam had ‘pro-nationalist’ plan for her first months in office, her key aide told the NIO in newly-declassied document‘Surreal’ moment as Irish Presbyterian leader ‘insisted to diplomats that he wasn’t Irish’Gerry Adams was ignorant of basic Protestant views and didn’t think he had to persuade unionists to back a united Ireland: Declassied fileGovernment pondered renaming or giving away Stormont as it meticulously planned for the Good Friday Agreement, declassied files revealNIO wanted to give lump sum to war hero Forum chairman due to job’s stress prior to  Agreement, declassied file showsForeign Office urged Tony Blair towards a closer relationship with ‘pragmatic’ new Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in : Declassied Files——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So many businesses have been closed this year and at times itrsquos been like a ghost town. I think people have recognised the situation and reevaluated how they do things.ldquoI regularly get people who live here who think Irsquom new ndash and Irsquove been here  years. Then I realise they usually work away from Penarth from Monday to Friday and on Saturday they go to the supermarket ndash but thatrsquos changed recently.ldquoWhen people pop out for a sandwich theyrsquore staying in Penarth, and theyrsquore coming to see the Christmas window displays.Hamptons was one of the first in the town to don the Christmas tinsel, and Mr Knowles said this year it was important they ldquopushed the boat out.ldquoWhen we entered the firebreak we took the decision that people needed some sparkle, but we were also concerned of more restrictions before Christmas, he added.ldquoWe thought it made sense for everyone to bring Christmas forward.ldquoThen we had the luxury of being closed for two weeks to really focus and do as much decorating as we could.ldquoI think itrsquos important. When I was a kid I remember going to look at the displays in the stores. You rarely get that anymore.Owner of Umpa Lumpa Sweet Shop Karen Dunlop says she feels traders have reaped the rewards of putting so much effort into bringing the festive season in early.ldquoWersquore certainly seeing that. Last month was one of the best Novembers wersquove had, and itrsquos the same this month,\" she said.ldquoPeople are becoming more confident again.Wersquove had a lot more orders online and in bigger quantities ndash it means people can still shop online but can shop locally online. That change of mindset has been crucial.Mel Grfin at Grfin Books says it is a culmination of hard work among traders.ldquoCustomer loyalty takes years to cultivate and I donrsquot think you can pin it to one thing, but wersquove certainly seen the benefits more this Christmas, she said.ldquoThe online shop we worked onduring lockdown has worked brilliantly for us. It probably means wersquove had more shoppers from further afield too.ldquoI am sure the offers and the campaigns have helped, and itrsquos that community spirit among traders which is a huge strength of ours. I hope the impact on peoplersquos shopping habits is long lasting.Mr Knowles praised traders societies Penarth Business Group and Shop Penarth for their efforts to get more people to the town.ldquoLots of towns donrsquot have what we have ndash a group of businesses that make a collective effort to back one another,\" he said. \"Itrsquos important we keep that going and donrsquot rest on our laurels.ldquoWe canrsquot think of it as though wersquove got the answer to a successful high street, because there will always be a need to reinvent.\"Perhaps itrsquos more of a first page in an exciting new chapter. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMinister for education, Kirsty Williams confirmed the move as part of a ldquonational effort to reduce transmission of the coronavirus.The minister said: Minister Kirsty Williams said: ldquoEvery day, we are seeing more and more people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms.ldquoThe virus is putting our health service under signicant and sustained pressure and it is important we all make a contribution to reduce its transmission.ldquoIn his advice to me today, the CMO recommends that a move to online learning should be implemented for secondary school pupils as soon as is practicable.ldquoI can therefore confirm that a move to online learning should be implemented for secondary school pupils and college students from Monday next week.ldquoWe recognise, as we did during the firebreak, that it is more dficult for primary and special school age children to undertake self-directed learning.ldquoThat is why we are encouraging primary and special schools to continue to stay open.ldquoHaving spoken to local education leaders, I am confident that schools and colleges have online learning provision in place.ldquoThis will also be important in ensuring that students are at home during this time, learning and staying safe.ldquoCritically, and this is very important, children should be at home.ldquoThis is not an early Christmas holiday, please do everything you can to minimise your contact with others.The Minister said her decision followed expert advice from Walesrsquos Chief Medical Officer showing that the public health situation in Wales was deteriorating.The latest data shows that rates of COVID- have further increased across Wales and have now exceeded  k with a test positivity of %.The R rate in Wales has increased to . with a doubling time of just . days.There had been calls for schools in Wales to close early in order to allow children time to quarantine ahead of the Christmas period, with some parents saying they would not send their children to school in the final week of term.However, the Welsh Government had previously stated schools would remain open.On Monday, health minister Vaughan Gething said: \"A signicant number of schools have not had an outbreak. Primary schools in particular, there is no rationale to close them.\"We have to take in account the fact that evidence doesnrsquot show signicant harm we can reduce or avoid by closing them.\"What we do know is that it causes real harm to children and their prospects.\"It is also the direct impact on the mental health and wellbeing of children by closing schools.\"While first minister Mark Drakeford said: ldquoIf I thought that those young people would genuinely be at home, genuinely self-isolating, genuinely creating that period before Christmas to keep them safe, Id be attracted to the idea.\"Im afraid the risks are that that simply wouldnt happen, that those children would be doing riskier things than they would in school. Better for them to be in school.\"But there was pressure from teaching unions for a sht in position.The National Association of Headteachers Cymruwrote to the minister for education, Kirsty Williams, to call for the closure of schools ahead of the Christmas holiday.They said: ldquoParents will undoubtedly vote with their feet and children will be kept at home.\"That choice will not be afforded to school staffschool leaders are not supported in closing school sites.\"No direction from the government on this issue risks large numbers of families making their own decision to take children out of school and once again will result in a mixed economy across Wales, with local authorities making their own decisions based on local circumstances. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help.

In these woods live Barbastelle and Bechsteinrsquos bat, and rare birds like lesser redpoll, lesser spotted woodpecker and woodcock.The Vale council is currently consulting the public on the proposals. The consultation runs until December , after which the council will consider what to do next mdash potentially drawing up a full business case for the new road.Coed Cadw is encouraging people to register their concerns about the loss of ancient woodland on their website, with six days left to register objections.A spokesman for the Vale of Glamorgan council said: ldquoNo decisions have been made on this matter, which is currently the subject of public consultation.Natalie ButtrissldquoEarly in the new year, a consultation report will be presented to cabinet and a decision taken on next steps.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community\"The increasing numbers of Covid- case numbers across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan Health Board area could not be any more serious or alarming.Therefore, this message needs to be acted upon urgently and be seen as a warning to each and every one of us about the seriousness of the health situation we are all now facing.If current projections continue, then by Christmas week we will be seeing more than four times the number of new infections each day, than we were seeing at the start of December. These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This means it will have few storage and transportation issues, making it much easier to use in community settings such as care homes and primary care settings like GP surgeries.Wales health minister Vaughan Gething said: ldquoWe understand there are high expectations and excitement at the arrival of a second vaccine. However it will take time to reach everyone as this is not an instant fix. We wonrsquot receive all the doses at once and we have to be realistic about the scale and pace of delivery when we are vaccinating the entire adult population.ldquoWe will not see the impact of the vaccine for some months and the pressure on the NHS will continue during this winter.

To help the NHS to help you please wait to be invited for your vaccination.Senior responsible officer for Walesrsquo Covid- vaccine programme Dr Gillian Richardson said: ldquoThe vaccine has been approved as safe and effective by the MHRA, based on the same high standards as applied to all medicines and vaccines.ldquoIt is great news that a second vaccine has met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the MHRA.Dr Nicola Williams, director of support and delivery at Health and Care Research Wales, which is nationally co-ordinating research and study-set up in Wales, said: ldquoOur research community is working hard to provide the evidence we need to fight this pandemic and the approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is an important step forward. We have two further vaccines being tested in Wales right now, with more trials due to be set up in the coming weeks and months.ldquoThis research, alongside the other Covid- studies taking place will help us to not only protect the most vulnerable but also to provide the best care possible for those who become ill.ldquoIrsquom proud of the role our researchers in Wales have played in this UK-wide effort and I would like to thank the participants too who have volunteered.

The Minister said: “My main priority has always been to protect our children’s education, mental health and well-being. I believe that this can best be achieved through face-to-face learning and social engagement in schools. “I am mindful of the impact the pandemic is having on our children and young people, particularly those who are vulnerable and from disadvantaged backgrounds. We have a high number of vulnerable children in Northern Ireland, for many of these pupils school is a safe haven and closing schools will immediately deprive them of this safe space. “That is why I have decided that it is in the best interests of all pupils for schools to open in the first week of January so that their education is not disrupted any further. “I want to again thank school leaders, teachers and staff who have done tremendous work, under very dficult circumstances, to keep schools safe. “I know that they will continue to reinforce departmental guidance, including the appropriate wearing of masks within schools and on school transport. “For my part, I will consider what further steps can be taken to help and support schools and will continue to seek the views of principals, school staff and pupils on this issue. “Finally, I want to wish principals, school staff, pupils and everyone who works in education a happy Christmas. The New Year will bring challenges but by continuing to work together we can get through this.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eafceabdffec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbfeacec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1608539461488.jpg--christmas_bubbling_reduced_to_one_day.jpg?160853946100","title":"christmas bubbling reduced to one day ","story":"THE Executive has taken the decision to limit the arrangements for people to come together over Christmas. Christmas bubbling will now be reduced to one day only on a date between December  and  to ensure flexibility for those working on Christmas Day to choose an alternative day that suits best. At last nights extraordinary Executive meeting, Ministers discussed the progression of the pandemic and were updated by the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor on the emergence and rapid spread of a iant strain of the virus. A statement after the meeting readL The safest place for everyone to spend Christmas is in their own home and people are strongly advised to stay at home for Christmas. Those who feel they need to meet with their bubble should keep it as small as possible, as close to home as possible and keep the visit short. Follow public health advice rigorously. Keep your contacts to an absolute minimum keep your distance wear a face covering and wash your hands. The Executive is urging everyone to travel onlyit is absolutely necessary. Travel is not permitted in or out of Tier  areas in England. Restrictions apply in other tier areas. Everyone should comply with all travel restrictions in place for each region and check the guidance at both the point of departure and destination. The Executive also discussed the issue of restricting travel and Ministers agreed to consider this further when they next meet. In relation to schools, Health and Education officials continue to liaise closely to consider how schools can operate as safely as possible. As this is a rapidly evolving situation, the Executive will continue to keep all matters under review, the statement added.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eafceabdffec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbfeacec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1608569304946.jpg--swann__follow_the_three_wise_moves_this_christmas.jpg?160856930400","title":"swann follow the three wise moves this christmas ","story":",\"image\":,\"description\":\"HEALTH Minister Robin Swann has urged everyone across Northern Ireland to keep taking the simple steps that prevent the spread of COVID-.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

As Christmas Day approaches, public health advice has been summarised into “Three Wise Moves”. The Minister said: We must remain vigilant about the threat from COVID-. The virus does not take time off. By strictly following public health advice, we can help reduce the risk to ourselves and others. “The emergence of a new strain of the virus has underlined the need to keep up our guard at all times. We underestimate this virus at our peril.” The Three Wise Moves are: Remember the basics. Keep contacts to a minimum. Keep your distance from others, wash your hands, wear a face covering. We’ve heard this advice countless times this year. But it’s just as relevant and just as important as it ever was. This is how we protect ourselves every day. Be risk aware. Particular settings are known to help COVID- spread: crowded places, close-contact settings especially where people have close conversations, confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. Remember over Christmas that social distancing can slip in familiar surroundings and familiar company. Watch out for old habits creeping back in. This cannot be a normal festive season. If in doubt, walk away. If any situation makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, remove yourself from it. Put safety first and err on the side of caution. That’s particularly important in the next few days ahead of the lockdown, when shops and hospitality will still be open. Just because we can do something, it doesn’t mean we have to. No set of regulations can cover every part of le or every activity. We all have to do our own risk assessments and make our own decisions on how best to keep each other safe.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eafceabdffec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbfeacec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1609333145190.jpg--assembly_recalled_to_discuss_schools_reopening.jpg?160933314500","title":"assembly recalled to discuss schools reopening ","story":"THE Stormont Assembly is set to be recalled to discuss next weeks planned reopening ofschoolsamid concerns over increasing coronaviruscase numbers.
