The Midlands, the North East and North West were estimated to have R rates between 0.9 and 1.1. In a separate surveillance report published yesterday, the UK Health Security Agency said Covid cases were falling in every age group in England last week.But it was based on 15 per cent fewer PCR and lateral flow tests than the previous seven-day spell, which may explain the drop.And other estimates from King\u0027s College London scientists said cases had risen five per cent in a week across the whole UK.Mr Dowden today urged Britons to keep calm and carry on as concern mounts over the Omicron variant.He Sky News: \u0027The message to people, I think, is fairly straightforward - which is keep calm, carry on with your Christmas plans. We\u0027ve put the necessary restrictions in place, but beyond that keep calm and carry on.\u0027I understand that people have concerns around the new variant. That\u0027s why the Government has taken the sort of measures that we\u0027ve already outlined ... we think those are sufficient at this stage and, beyond that, people should continue with their plans as intended.\u0027Amid confusion about what to do, many of Britain\u0027s biggest employers including the NHS, banks and tech firms have axed festive bashes completely or taken them online. It is now said to be a 5050 split.Omicron is yet to gain a foothold in the UK, estimates suggest although scientists warn it will eventually hit the country. There are 59 cases spotted to date, and some are not linked to foreign travel suggesting it may already be spreading in the community. Scotland\u0027s Omicron cases are linked to a Steps concert held in Glasgow, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said today as she confirmed community transmission of the variant. ONS head of analytical outpots for the survey Sarah Crofts, said: \u0027We have not yet identified any infections compatible with the new Omicron variant in our survey. The Delta variant remains the most common across the UK.\u0027We will continue to monitor for different variants among our survey participants as part of our work tracking the virus.\u0027Dozens of Christmas party-goers who became infected with suspected cases of Omicron Covid in Norway have only mild symptoms, doctors have revealed.Up to 60 people who fell ill after attending a party on Oslo\u0027s waterfront a week ago have so-far developed headaches and sore throats while a few have a cough.Tine Ravlo, chief physician for the district where the outbreak took place, said the symptoms are broadly consistent with what is being reported from South Africa, where the variant first emerged.But, he added, it is still too early to tell whether that makes Omicron more or less dangerous than Delta. All of the infected are young and all are believed to have been vaccinated - a combination that typically leads to milder symptoms.Concrete data is yet to emerge confirming whether Omicron is more mild than the Delta variant, which is currently widespread.The reproduction rate in the South African province at the epicentre of the Omicron outbreak has surged from below one to above three in less than a month, as the super-strain outpaces Delta at a ferocious pace.Public Health officials in Guateng province estimate that the R value — a key measure used to gauge how fast a wave is growing — could be as high as 3.5. For comparison, the UK\u0027s R rate has never been above 1.6.The Omicron strain has triggered a meteoric rise in cases in South Africa, mostly concentrated in Guateng, since the country that first alerted the world about the highly-evolved virus on November 24.Nationally, cases there soared to 11,535 on Thursday marking a 370 per cent rise in a week, and up a third on around 8,500 yesterday. It has become the dominant strain in the country in little over a week since it was officially discovered, making up 75 per cent of sequenced samples.A pre-print from South Africa published yesterday found that the new strain is at least two-and-a-half times better at re-infecting people than all other variants.This could explain why it\u0027s spreading so fast in Guateng province, where up to 80 per cent have natural immunity, and not so fast in other countries where it has been detected like the UK for weeks. Only a quarter of South Africans are vaccinated, compared to around 70 per cent in the UK, US and Europe.While Omicron\u0027s infectiousness seems unquestionable, there is growing uncertainty about how well it can evade vaccines and how severe the illness it causes will be. The World Health Organization (WHO) today revealed zero deaths around the world have been caused by the new variant.Public health experts in South Africa and the WHO have insisted cases are only mild and vaccines should still be highly effective against the strain, despite a lack of data.But UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) epidemiologist Meaghan Kall warned that data currently suggests Omicron may be \u0027worse\u0027 than Delta — although the picture is still emerging.She said she was \u0027highly sceptical\u0027 that the strain causes milder symptoms, saying infections may only appear less severe because people have immunity against other variants, unlike in the first wave.         ‹ Slide me ›    The above maps show percentage change in Covid cases across England in the week to November 21 (left), and November 28 (right).

They face hefty fees — £22,000 annually for an undergraduate degree — and must navigate tiresome visa rules among other stumbling blocks.China, by contrast, heavily subsidises foreign students’ education. Sought-after courses such as medicine or engineering can be free of charge, with travel and accommodation thrown in. China reaps lifelong loyalty from such largesse.There is another grievance that China can exploit. This stems from the Covid-19 pandemic — with rich countries accused of hoarding vaccines, leaving poorer countries much more vulnerable.Vaccination rates in most Commonwealth countries are low — under two per cent in Nigeria, for example, and only five per cent in Kenya. These countries’ healthcare systems have struggled to cope with Covid.Resentment over what is seen as the unfairness of our response chimes with other injustices.In Caribbean countries, the Windrush scandal has shrivelled British prestige. People who arrived here legally to begin new lives were wrongly detained, denied benefits and, in some cases, lost their homes and jobs, while some were even deported.Chinese propaganda gleefully highlights these woes and fans resentments.How ironic, though, that while Britain agonises over its imperial history — and Prince Charles, in Barbados, referred to the ‘appalling atrocity’ of slavery — China happily practises imperialism right now.The fact is that Britain devoted huge resources to extirpating slavery across its empire. But China consigns hundreds of thousands of its own citizens to labour camps.Yet Commonwealth countries seem all too ready to overlook Beijing’s appalling record on human rights.South Africa, a Commonwealth nation that, under Nelson Mandela, was a champion of human rights and which suffered under apartheid as recently as 1993, is silent on Beijing’s crimes.There are some big exceptions, though. India, the largest country in the world after China — and the biggest in the Commonwealth — is a neighbour, rival and resolute foe. The two giants have skirmished in the Himalayas. China is by far India’s biggest security threat — not least because of its attempts to suborn neighbouring Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh.India is pushing back hard against attempts to encircle it, prime minister Narendra Modi building strong security ties with the U.S.Australia and Canada — also in the Commonwealth — have witnessed ruthless efforts by Beijing to exploit the Chinese diaspora, to muzzle academic and media freedom, and to punish critics.With Britain and the United States, these two countries are part of the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence-sharing alliance. This highly successful arrangement has its roots in the wartime coalition against Hitler. But it is developing fast, with efforts to counter Chinese (and Russian) economic and political influence.But the fifth ‘Eye’, New Zealand, is gazing with considerable — and, to its allies, concerning — interest at China.The country’s Left-wing prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, is conspicuously silent about China’s human rights abuses, and pooh-poohs worries about its influence in her country. We are in an ‘ideological war’ with Beijing, says Sir Iain Duncan Smith.China believes that one-party rule works best, and human rights and the rule of law come second to the national interest. The West, it insists, is beset by economic, political and cultural decline.As Chairman Xi contemplates China’s global reach, he may reckon — as our imperial forebears once did — that across our own Commonwealth, he is building an ‘empire on which the sun never sets’."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b426d79fd6bcd67008b93835a38c8082c03c918/1355_0_3890_2336/master/3890.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8c7c8ff2b62840cf64898788ccc23193","title":"covid news live new york state detects five cases of omicron variant as new us air travel rules loom","story":"Utah said the case was discovered through “ongoing genetic sequencing”. It has now been detected in 38 countries, but no deaths have been reported, the global health agency said on Friday. The WHO has warned it could take weeks to determine how infectious the variant is, whether it causes more severe illness and how effective treatments and vaccines are against it. “We’re going to get the answers that everybody out there needs,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said. It brings the total number of confirmed cases to 104. People who have tested positive and their contacts have been asked to self-isolate. Work is underway to find any links to travel. Cases have been identified in the east Midlands, east of England, London, north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west and West Midlands.  Earlier on Friday health officials said that more than half of those infected with the Omicron variant were double jabbed. Dr Jenny Harries, the UKHSA chief executive said: “Increased case detection through focused contact tracing has led to more cases of the Omicron variant being identified and confirmed, as we have seen in other countries globally. “We are continuing to monitor the data closely. Teams nationally and locally are working at pace to identify and trace all close contacts of every Omicron case. It is critical that anyone with Covid-19 symptoms isolates and gets a PCR test immediately. “We have started to see cases where there are no links to travel, suggesting that we have a small amount of community transmission.”The death total, one of the world’s largest, now stands at 615,400. It registered 10,627 new cases on Friday.Another 16,055 new cases were reported on Friday, taking the total confirmed infections to 3,004,203. “This increase represents a 24.3 percent positivity rate,” the government run National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said in a daily update.  Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Missouri and Maryland reported cases on Friday as more states identify incidences of it. The midwest state of Nebraska confirmed six cases, Maryland had three. A man in his 30s tested positive for the variant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Reuters reports. Missouri also has a single case.A total of 466,348,132 doses were given out as of Friday morning, up from 464,445,850 the day before, US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. More than 198 million people are now fully vaccinated with one of the Moderna, PfizerBioNTech or Johnson \u0026amp Johnson inoculations.In an interview with AFP during a visit to Moscow, Francesco Rocca, the president of the charity said: “The scientific community has warned... on several occasions about the risks of very new variants in places where there is a very low rate of vaccinations.” A further 16 cases have been found in Scotland in the last 24 hours, five times the increase recorded the previous day, with some linked to a Steps concert in Glasgow 11 days ago. Wales also announced its first case on Friday, and more cases have been discovered in England, although precise new figures remained unconfirmed on Friday evening. The sharp rise in cases came as a new risk assessment from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the new variant is “transmitting rapidly and successfully”. A separate analysis by the agency of the first 22 Omicron cases in England also found that more than half of those infected had been double jabbed. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Friday that Eli Lilly’s Covid-19 therapy for mild and moderate diseases could be used on children who are at high risk for progression to severe disease, Reuters reports.Johnson said: “I’ve noticed there’s been quite a lot of to-ing and fro-ing about it, people concerned that they need to cancel their Christmas parties. That’s not right, we’re not saying that and we’re not saying that nativity plays have to be cancelled. “I believe very strongly that kids should be in school and I also think that Christmas should go ahead as normally as possible. But the key point, the key point is that whatever the risk Omicron may pose, or may not pose, the booster is everywhere and always, vaccination is going to be your best protection, so everybody should get it.” On a visit to Oswestry in North Shropshire, Johnson saw Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst vaccinating people at a pharmacy. However in comments to the press, he called him “Dr Neil Shastri-Hughes”. He said: “I think we’ve got a fantastic candidate, Dr Neil Shastri-Hughes, who I’ve just been seen contributing already to the life of the community by vaccinating people, he’s a doctor amongst his many other talents and what he’s also going to do is work very, very hard for the people of North Shropshire.”Rosstat said on Friday that 520,000 people have died since Russia recorded its first case. It means the country has the third worst death toll behind the US and Brazil, according to AFP. Authorities in Moscow have been accused of downplaying the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and Rosstat’s figure – released late on Friday – painted a far darker picture than official figures suggest.

Photograph: Alvaro BarrientosAPThere is evidence of waning immunity in all Covid-19 vaccines six months after the final dose, a review of international research by the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) has found. The report says Covid-19 vaccines provide protection “for at least six months post-vaccination”, with some research pointing to “potential waning of vaccine effectiveness for severe disease in iniduals at higher risk”. The healthcare regulator said any drop in vaccine efficacy among more vulnerable groups “would be a concern”. There was also “uncertainty” about the impacts of new variants of concern, it added. “While some differences were observed between the various vaccines, there was evidence of waning effectiveness across almost all observational studies in the general population which examined effectiveness up to six months after the final regimen dose,” Hiqa said. The health watchdog said one study from Public Health England suggested “waning vaccine effectiveness” against the dominant Delta variant.Hiqa reviewed more than 50 studies on vaccine effectiveness and immunity, and provided advice on its findings to the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac), which make recommendations to the Government on vaccines. Studies showed Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines were highly effective for fighting severe disease. Research looking at the one-shot Janssen vaccine found its effectiveness in preventing severe disease over time varied from 60 per cent to 91 per cent. Hiqa said one study pointed to the Pfizer vaccine’s effectiveness having “a possible decline over time,” but noted vaccine efficacy exceeded 83 per cent “for symptomatic disease up to six months after vaccination”. AstraZenecaFor people aged 65 and older, Hiqa said one study showed the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine dropped to as low as 36 per cent after six months. Other studies pointed to rates of effectiveness for the Janssen vaccine of 68 percent for those over 60, and 64 per cent in over 70s who received Moderna. Regarding immunocompromised people, two studies found the vaccines were “less effective” in preventing hospitalisation with the virus.The regulator said studies of vaccinated residents in nursing homes found lower levels of immunity, which it said suggests residents “may have a lower baseline level” of vaccine immunity, compared to the general population. Hiqa also looked at 16 studies into vaccine effectiveness for healthcare workers, which found similar rates of immunity to other studies of the general population. It said the evidence showed vaccines provided “a high level of protection against severe disease, symptomatic infection and any infection”. It noted healthcare workers may still contract the virus, “particularly when combined with high incidence rates in the community”. This meant a continued risk of health services facing staffing pressures, or cases where the virus was transmitted from staff to vulnerable patients. There was “limited and inconsistent evidence” from research on the efficacy and effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines among people with underlying conditions. It was “unclear” if the protection of vaccines waned quicker in those with underlying conditions than the general population, Hiqa said. Dr Mark O’Loughlin, Hiqa public health fellow, said the findings of the various studies should encourage anyone offered a booster vaccine to avail of it.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinA “slight delay” in introducing a strict new Covid testing system for people travelling to Ireland from overseas has been described as “maddening” by an umbrella group representing the travel sector.The new system which is now due to come into force from Sunday has also damaged consumer confidence with bookings “back to lockdown levels”, according to the president of the Irish Travel Agents Association (ITAA) Paul Hackett.At the start of the week the Government announced that all incoming travellers except those travelling from Northern Ireland will have to present a negative test result in order to enter the country irrespective of the vaccination status.The move came in response to concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and the test requirements were due to be introduced from midnight on Thursday.However the system was postponed at the last minute to midnight on Sunday in order to allow airlines prepare for checks.An Aer Lingus spokesman told The  they had been informed of the delay on Thursday night.The deferral angered travellers who were due to come to Ireland this weekend and had already paid for tests which were no longer a requirement.Mr Hackett said the delay was “maddening”. He pointed out that members of the ITAA had “worked hard to inform clients in time. The clients have wasted money for tests that are not needed”.He also expressed concern about what “the confusion does to consumer confidence” and he said that since the start of the week and the announcement that more restrictions on travel were being introduced “sales are back to lockdown levels with no supports” in place for the industry.On Friday morning the Minister for Justice Helen McEntee described the altered timeline as a “slight delay” and stressed that it was “ not an intentional delay” but was needed to get all the regulations in place.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach says he shares public s frustration at renewed covid 19 restrictions","story":"The new measures include a recommendation that no more than four households should mix over the holidays (one hosting, three visiting) the closing of nightclubs and a cap of of six people at tables in bars and restuarants, which must close at midnight. Video: RTETaoiseach Micheál Martin: ‘The challenge we face is that while we have stabalised the surge of cases in the country the daily case numbers are still very high.’  Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireTaoiseach Micheál Martin told the country that he shares “the disappointment and frustration that this will cause” as he announced renewed Covid-19 restrictions on the hospitality and entertainment sectors on Friday evening. He said that when he spoke about the recent rise in cases, he had asked that people reduce their social interactions. “You did all that and as a country we pulled it back, with enormous effort, our hospitals held,” he said. “We have stabilised the surge”.“However, just as getting a handle on it reports began to emerge of a new and potentially more dangerous version of this virus,” he said, adding that the government will “do whatever we reasonably can to stop this new variant circulating in the country”. The new measures Mr Martin went on to outline include a recommendation that no more than four households should mix over the festive period (one hosting, three visiting), the closing of nightclubs and a cap of of six people on the number of people that can seated at tables in bars and restaurants which must close at midnight. Hotel bars and restaurants will also have to ask patrons for the pass, meaning residents in hotels now have to produce it as well.Capacity at indoor events like concerts will again be reduced to 50 per cent while the digital Covid pass will be extended to gyms and leisure centres, apart from access to swimming pools. The measures will come back into force on December 7th and be in place until January 9th, 2022. Mr Martin said that the experience to date shows that if Omicron is as transmissible as feared, it will be “impossible” to stop it coming into the State at a more serious level.“The challenge we face is that while we have stabilised the surge of cases in the country the daily case numbers are still very high,” he said. The chief medical officer and public health officials have been “exceptionally clear in their advice to Government,” he said, adding that the risk of proceeding without further restrictions is “just too high”. “The protection of public health is the Government’s primary responsibility and we will do whatever is needed to discharge that duty”. He added: “We will do whatever we need to do to safely steer our society and economy through this”.In words directed towards the children of Ireland, he said: “You are a very special generation, thank you for what you’ve done and what you continue to do.”“This latest twist is disappointing but we are nowhere near back where we were,” he said, adding that the country would persevere through the “spirit of resilience” and of “solidarity” and “trust in science” and a “spirit of community”. MeetingNphet had met on Thursday to consider advice for the Government on the latest pandemic situation, at a time when Covid-19 case numbers have stabilised at a high level and further information on the Omicron variant is being awaited. Earlier on Friday, Mr Martin and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath met representatives of the hospitality industry, who raised concerns about the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) being cut earlier this week. The Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI) said the meeting, which heard calls for a comprehensive support package for the sector, was “positive and constructive”. “While no decision was made at the meeting, Government has confirmed that hospitality businesses will be supported over the next number weeks due to recognition that business has substantially declined,” RAI chief executive Adrian Cummins said, adding that hospitality representatives had asked the Government to establish a long-term plan for the viability of the sector. Pádraig Cribben, chief executive of the Vintners’ Federation of Ireland, said he believed “those at the top of Government” understood their concerns and that he would expect any announcements by the Government on Nphet advice to be “accompanied by some supports for the sector”.The VFI said the Taoiseach said he understood that public health messaging asking people to avoid socialising was having a hugely detrimental impact on the trade in what should be the busiest period of the year for pubs.Testing for travellersSeparately, the Government has notified airlines that the introduction of a system of PCR and antigen testing for passengers arriving into Ireland has been delayed by 48 hours.The measure was due to come into force on Friday, but Aer Lingus said airlines had been informed on Thursday night that the regulations would now begin on Sunday. All arrivals into the State – whether vaccinated or not – will need a negative Covid-19 test result from then onwards.Those travelling with an antigen test result will need to have obtained it within 48 hours of arrival into Ireland, and it will have to be a professionally administered test. Those with a PCR test result will have a longer pre-travel window of 72 hours. On Friday evening, the Department of Health said the Minister, Stephen Donnelly, had signed the relelvant regulations.Earlier, Maynooth University professor of immunology Paul Moynagh said the latest restrictions reportedly proposed by Nphet could lead to some benefits but seemed “random and arbitrary”.He told Newstalk Breakfast that “big mistakes” have been made with regard to messaging to the public.“Back in September contact tracing was stood down the reason being that children were missing too much school. But we had the option of keeping contact tracing and using antigen testing. And there has been a resistance over the last year from Nphet in terms of using antigen testing,” he said.“We saw over the last number of days the reluctance of Nphet again to impress advice from experts in the area of ventilation and air filtration. There seems to be this reluctance to accept scientific advice from outside.”Prof Moynagh said there was a need to look at this reluctance and “learn from our mistakes”.“Whereas at the moment it seems that mistakes are made and that narrative is defended. And again we end up now with new restrictions that I am not convinced are going to be very impactful,” he said.

Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireTánaiste Leo Varadkar has suggested that the Covid-19 pandemic could continue into next winter saying we need to “seize the summer” while preparing for a possible resurgence.It comes as the Government announced new restrictions in response to the continued high level of cases of the virus and the threat of the new Omicron variant.Taoiseach Micheál Martin listed the new restrictions on the hospitality and entertainment sectors in a televised address where he told the country he shares “the disappointment and frustration that this will cause”.Mr Martin said it is “not about going back to the days of lockdowns” but about adjusting the guidelines to the current threat from the virus.The Government has accepted recommendations made by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) which will be in place from next Tuesday, December 7th until January 9th.Under the new measures nightclubs will closed and there will be tighter measures adopted again in bars, restaurants and hotels.Tables will be limited to six iniduals and no multiple bookings will be allowed though closing time remains at midnight.There is to be a maximum of 50 per cent capacity at indoor entertainment and sporting events.Covid passes will be required for gyms, leisure centres, and hotel bars and restaurants.Mr Martin confirmed the Government has adopted Nphet’s advice on household visits and limiting them to three other households, while acknowledging the need for flexibility.Mr Varadkar said this will be advice and it won’t be enforced by gardaí. The Government is not telling people what they can and can’t do in their own homes, he said.The current rules for weddings remain unchanged. At a press conference on Friday evening it was put to Mr Martin that he had previously said that once a sector was opened it would not close again and the new measures amounted to an admission of failure.He replied: “Not at all. I don’t think that’s a fair assessment... the threats with the virus change and I think the vast bulk of society is open and remains open.”Strong seasonal componentMr Varadkar conceded that the pandemic could still be around next winter.He said some experts have suggested the pandemic could last five years adding: “I certainly hope that’s not the case.”Mr Varadkar said it is clear there is a strong seasonal component and that means two things have to be done. Firstly he said “we need to seize the summer”. “The last two summers we had the toughest restrictions in Europe... I’m determined that will not be the case next summer. We should open safely if we can”.Secondly, he said: “We also need to prepare for next winter while dealing with this winter because there will be new variants”.That includes building up the capacity of our health service and in the test, trace and isolate system, which he said the Government has been doing.Mr Varadkar did say that scientists believe they can tweak vaccines for new variants within three months and there will new anti-viral tablets available next year and “that will help too”.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said one thing that gives him confidence is the booster vaccine campaign and indications that the jabs will still provide protection from the Omicron variant. The Government announced a series of expanded financial supports for the hospitality and entertainment sectors and workers who may lose their jobs. The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) will be temporarily reopened to new entrants in order to cater for people who lose their jobs as a result of the restrictions. Further details are to be announced in the coming days.There is to be an extra €25 million to support the live entertainment sector.Mr Varadkar said that the Covid Response Support Scheme (CRSS) will be reformed to help more businesses.Up until now it was only paid to businesses that had to close or saw a 75 per cent reduction in turnover. It will now apply to businesses like restaurants, pubs, theatres and nightclubs who are impacted by the restrictions though there will be terms and conditions involved. Minister Paschal Donohoe is looking at raising the weekly €5,000 cap. The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) - the rates of which were cut this week - will stay at the new reduced rates.Mr Varadkar said this is because the majority of businesses and jobs supported by the EWSS are not in sectors affected by the new restrictions.He said the Government want to make sure EWSS is targeted at those that need it the most.There will be a €62.3 million targeted commercial rates waiver for the first three months of 2022 for businesses in the hospitality and entertainment sector that are impacted by the restrictions.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Oil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaints"},{"url":null,"title":"us political discourse turns ever uglier even between party colleagues","story":"Ilhan Omar during a press conference addressing anti-Muslim comments made by Lauren Boebert. Photograph: Stefani ReynoldsThe New York TimesObserving US politics at close hand since arriving in Washington, one thing stands out the lack of civility that exists in the discourse not just between some politicians and their opponents but also between those in the same party.In Ireland there are politicians who may not like each other and who disagree widely on policy, and there may be strong verbal clashes in the Dáil, but the language used and the actions taken are nowhere near as extreme as those now taking place increasingly among some on Capitol Hill.Last month a Republican congressman from Arizona, Paul Gosar, was condemned by Democrats after he posted a violent cartoon video depicting him killing New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden. For days this week American media has been fascinated by a feud between a number of female politicians, which originally stemmed from comments by one Republican that appeared to suggest that a Muslim Democrat member of Congress could be a suicide bomber.This row spiralled outwards, drawing in others and ultimately leading to one right-wing Republican politician calling another, more moderate congresswoman “trash” while she in turn was accused being “bat sh*t crazy” and using extreme language to raise money.The focus is now on whether the Republican House of Representatives minority leader Kevin McCarthy is prepared to step in and try to impose some discipline on his troops. Some media commentators have suggested that McCarthy may be reluctant as opposing right-wingers in the party could jeopardise his chances of becoming speaker of the House if the Republicans win back control in the midterm elections next November – as seems likely on foot of current polling numbers.Lift storyIt all started when a video was posted on Twitter in which Colorado Republican Lauren Boebert likened Democrat representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota – who is Muslim and wears a hijab – to a terrorist.In the video, Boebert claimed a Capitol police officer ran towards a closing lift door in which she, one of her staff and Omar were inside.“I look to my left, and there she is: Ilhan Omar. And I said ‘Well, she doesn’t have a backpack, we should be fine,’ ” Boebert said. The congresswoman then allegedly turned to Omar and said, “The Jihad squad decided to show up for work today.”Omar denied the interaction ever happened and added: “Fact, this buffoon looks down when she sees me at the Capitol.”“Anti-Muslim bigotry isn’t funny and shouldn’t be normalised,” Omar tweeted subsequently. “Congress can’t be a place where hateful and dangerous Muslim tropes get no condemnation.”Amid criticism of Islamophobia, Boebert apologised “to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Representative Omar”.The two women later had a phone call that by all accounts did not end well.Boebert said Omar had wanted her to apologise publicly. Boebert said instead she had told Omar to make a public apology to the American people for her “anti-American, anti-Semitic, anti-police rhetoric”.Republican spatEnter at this point two other Republican congresswomen: firebrand right-winger Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and the more moderate Nancy Mace of South Carolina. Last Sunday Mace criticised her fellow Republican Boebert for her comments about Omar.“I have time after time condemned my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for racist tropes and remarks that I find disgusting and this is no different than any others.”Greene then waded into the row: “@NancyMace is the trash in the GOP Conference,” tweeted the Georgia Republican about her colleague from South Carolina on Tuesday morning. “Never attacked by Democrats or RINO’s (same thing) because she is not conservative, she’s pro-abort. Mace you can back up off of @laurenboebert or just go hang with your real gal pals, the Jihad Squad. Your out of your league,” she tweeted. Rino is a term used by some on the right for those t hey see as “Republican in name only”.Mace didn’t take this lying down and described Greene as a “grifter who made extreme comments to raise money”.Greene, however, has the ear of Donald Trump and suggested that the former president would support a candidate who would challenge Mace to run as the Republican nominee in her district in the elections next year.Some may see all this as good knockabout politics in the social media era.However, words can have consequences.Omar this week said she had received death threats and she played a voicemail that had been left for her.In the profanity-laced recording, a man’s voice says: “You will not be living much longer, bitch,” and that “we the people are rising up”. He calls Omar a “traitor” and says she will stand trial before a military tribunal.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"calm omicron uks immunity different south africas says expert","story":"Britain should “calm down” about omicron because new research suggests that UK immunity will be very different to South Africa and vaccines are holding up well, a leading immunologist has said.Danny Altmann, the professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said he had been initially terrified after seeing the amount of worrying mutations that the omicron variant carried.However, at a briefing on Friday, he said he had been “calmed” by real world data, showing that the majority of hospitalised patients are unvaccinated. His own new research also suggested that immunity among the British population is likely to be different to that of South Africa.The study from Imperial and Queen Mary University of London showed that people become “imprinted” with a specific immune profile after encountering coronavirus, its variants and the vaccines, and this dictates how well they will fight off new variants.The paper showed that those who contracted the original Wuhan strain had fewer antibodies capable of fighting off the delta strain, but those who became infected later with alpha had developed antibodies better attuned to the new variant.It suggested that in countries such as South Africa, which have encountered different variants and have far lower vaccine uptakes than Britain, the immunity of the population will not be the same.“By now, 19 or 20 months into the pandemic, many of us on planet Earth have very different patterns of protective immunity to Sars-Cov-2 variants and these have been shaped by prior infection, plus vaccine exposures,” Prof Altmann said.“That’s what we mean by the term ‘immune imprinting’. I think we’ve been careful about any predictions about what omicron means to the UK, because we’re in such a different context here, in terms of an enormous background of delta caseload and higher vaccination rates.“I was one of the people who was quite fast to say I was terrified by the mutations. And I’m still kind of terrified by them. But I’m also kind of calmed by the real life on-the-ground data as it looks like even in South Africa, with low vaccination uptake, vaccines are holding up to some extent against it.“What it means for this country is I think we can calm down. The jury’s out. We’ve got a high level of vaccination and a backdrop of delta.”Doctors in South Africa also said that vaccinated patients with the omicron variant are having only mild to moderate symptoms, while the country’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases said that 87 per cent of hospitalised cases were unvaccinated.Prof Altmann added: “I guess that might mean that lots of other stuff that we’re not measuring is protecting them, including their T-cell memory and B-cell memory.”Research released by several South African universities on Thursday showed that omicron appears to increase the risk of a reinfection by 2.39 times compared to the original Wuhan strain, signalling that the mutated virus can escape immunity.However, the Imperial academics warned against transferring the South African findings to a British context.Rosemary Boyton, the professor of immunology and respiratory medicine at Imperial, and co-author of the immunity paper, said: “If you have a different immunological history, in terms of the types of spike that you’ve encountered, then you will have a different repertoire of immune responses.“And so it does make it extremely difficult to make those broad comparisons. Our current vaccines are pretty good. They do protect against hospitalisation, and death.”The new immunity paper was published in the journal Science.More from NewsArthur Labinjo-Hughes: Life must mean life for \u0026#39evil\u0026#39 child murderers, say former ministersIn the Republicans’ Game of Thrones, somebody needs to step up and kill the kingExclusive: Meet ‘Director K’, the MI5 spy responsible for keeping Britain safe from China and RussiaPestering women in the street set to be outlawedAlleged bullying of Palace staff sparked Kate and Meghan rowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"frank lampard hires mr loophole cyclist claims ex chelsea star","story":"Former Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has hired a lawyer known as “Mr Loophole” after a cycling activist allegedly caught him driving while using a phone.Mike Van Erp says he spotted the ex-Chelsea and England midfielder in a Mercedes holding a cup of coffee and chatting on his mobile while sitting in traffic in South Kensington.The cyclist was filming the incident, on April 27, and sent the video to police, saying he was “pretty disgusted” with Lampard’s driving.Lampard, 43, has now been charged with driving while using a mobile phone but denies the offence, and has hired the law firm of Nick “Mr Loophole” Freeman to fight his case at trial, The Evening Standard reports. Mr Van Erp rides with a helmet-mounted GoPro camera and regularly provides police with video evidence against motorists he believes have broken the law.Earlier this year he helped secure a prosecution against former champion boxer Chris Eubank who was caught running a red light in Hyde Park in his gold Rolls-Royce convertible.In 2020, Mr Van Erp reported Guy Ritchie for driving while using a phone, landing the Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels director with a six-month ban.In written evidence given to Bromley magistrates’ court, Mr Van Erp said: “I was cycling southbound on Gloucester Road and caught up to queuing traffic in both directions near the Gloucester Arms.“I noticed this driver of a black Mercedes 4x4 holding a coffee in his right hand, and a phone in his left. I could see him talking on the phone... whilst resting his right inside wrist on the steering wheel.”A letter from Freeman \u0026amp Co tells the court the star denies the charge and intends to fight the case at a trial.The Met say Lampard admitted being behind the wheel of the Mercedes and was offered a fixed penalty fine but did not pay it.

We have had all this talk about improving access to face-to-face appointments with GPs, but now instead they can stop carrying out health checks and still be paid for them. It looks like the BMA has ministers and officials over a barrel.”Mr Reed questioned why GPs were being offered “money for nothing,” on top of funding for every jab administered, asking: “Where are the patients in all this?”It comes amid growing public concern about difficulties accessing face-to-face appointments with family doctors. The matter saw the BMA threaten industrial action following a series of interventions by ministers, promising patients the right to see a GP in person.On Wednesday, Sajid Javid said “there was nothing more important” than the booster rollout as he confirmed that he was “revisiting” the workload of family doctors, while pledging to increase the number of patients being seen face to face.On Friday night, the Health Secretary wrote an open “thank you” letter to all GPs, applauding them for their “outstanding” care for patients and support delivering the vaccination programme.Family doctors were heavily involved in the initial vaccination programme for Covid. However, many declined to take part in the administration of boosters, saying that the workload was too onerous, amid growing public concern about difficulties accessing GP appointments for other reasons.Currently, the programme is administering just 2.6 million vaccines a week. Ministers have said they want to see it return to previous rates of more than 3.5 million jabs per week.The letter to GP practices and NHS trusts, from Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of the NHS, follows promises by senior officials to recruit 10,000 vaccinators, with volunteers urged to come forward to speed up the rollout of boosters. Some areas have been forced to cancel jabs for want of volunteers, it emerged on Friday.In the letter, officials also urged clinical students and senior staff with a medical background to come forward to join efforts, with every NHS hospital trust asked if it could offer jabs to the public. Dr Gary Howsam, the vice-chairman of external affairs at the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: “These are sensible, temporary measures that will address some of the bureaucratic demands on practices and have minimal impact on the care patients receive in general practice, allowing GPs and our teams to focus their efforts where currently most clinically necessary.”More from NewsArthur Labinjo-Hughes: Life must mean life for \u0026#39evil\u0026#39 child murderers, say former ministersIn the Republicans’ Game of Thrones, somebody needs to step up and kill the kingExclusive: Meet ‘Director K’, the MI5 spy responsible for keeping Britain safe from China and RussiaPestering women in the street set to be outlawedAlleged bullying of Palace staff sparked Kate and Meghan rowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"importing cheap american editions popular british cookbooks","story":"British cooks face having dishes ruined by an influx of American editions of recipe books, the Publishers Association has warned.Proposed changes to copyright laws could allow cheap foreign editions of cookbooks by chefs such as Nigella Lawson and Jamie Oliver to be imported into the UK, the industry body has said, along with their confusing foreign measurements.British cooks using US rather than UK editions could plunge kitchens into “chaos”, according to the Publishers Association, and lead to recipes being ruined as people struggle to get to grips with unfamiliar measurements.Cooks could also be confused by the nomenclature of ingredients, as polling conducted by YouGov reveals that terms like “cilantro” for coriander and “arugula” for rocket are largely unknown to people in the UK.Stephen Lotinga, the chief executive of the Publishers Association, said British cooks “deserve books that will help them create showstoppers to be proud of, not confusing American imports that risk leaving them with soggy bottoms and dry biscuits.“The measurements and terms used in cookbooks need to be understandable to their readers.”EU copyright rules allow price controls on books and prevent the sale of foreign editions of works by British writers being sold in the UK, but these laws are being reviewed by the Intellectual Property Office following Brexit.Industry experts fear that books made for a foreign market - and potentially priced lower to target that market - could be imported directly into the UK if these rules are relaxed, potentially undercutting British publishing.This could not only harm the revenues of authors and booksellers, Mr Lotinga has warned, but also the culinary efforts of consumers who have opted to buy cheaper foreign cookbooks containing measurements.Examples of British books adapted for the American market include Oliver’s book Together: Memorable Meals Made Easy, which has an edition with US measurements, and Everyday Easy by Lorraine Pascale.Lawson’s website also states that recipes in American editions of her best-selling books have measurements “converted from metric into US measurements of ounces, cups and tablespoons”.A YouGov survey for the Publishers Association found that more than half of respondents in the UK would be uncomfortable working with these American measurements, with 66 per cent usually working in grams and kilograms.Terminology is also a source of confusion, with American terms like “rutabaga” for swede only known by 14 per cent of people in the UK.US cookbooks may even call for foodstuffs difficult to procure in the UK, with recipes requiring “molasses” rather than the more British ingredient, golden syrup.Mr Lotinga and the Publishers Association are calling on the Government to step in and retain EU copyright laws to prevent “a flood of foreign editions into the UK”.Mr Lotinga said: “We’re asking the Government to listen to the UK’s home cooks and Save Our Books (the Publishers Association campaign) by maintaining our current laws.”The campaign follows concerns raised by prominent British authors about changes to copyright law, with figures including Philip Pullman warning that reforms could cause a harmful loss of revenue for UK publishing.With a decision on the Intellectual Property Office’s consultation expected in the run up to Christmas, the Publishers Association warned that British cooks face “festive failures” in future due to US imports, with recipes for mince pies and Christmas pudding potentially ruined due to confusion over measurements.The Intellectual Property Office has been contacted for comment.More from NewsArthur Labinjo-Hughes: Life must mean life for \u0026#39evil\u0026#39 child murderers, say former ministersIn the Republicans’ Game of Thrones, somebody needs to step up and kill the kingExclusive: Meet ‘Director K’, the MI5 spy responsible for keeping Britain safe from China and RussiaPestering women in the street set to be outlawedAlleged bullying of Palace staff sparked Kate and Meghan rowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pestering women street set outlawed","story":"Pestering women in the street or in pubs and making lewd comments at them could become an offence under plans to criminalise “public sexual harassment”, which are set to be announced next week.A government-commissioned review of hate crimes will call for public sexual harassment and inciting hatred against women to be made criminal offences as part of an overhaul of laws to protect women and girls against violence.But the review by the Law Commission - the body responsible for framing hundreds of the UK’s laws - will reject demands for misogyny to be made a hate crime because it believes it would be ineffective, according to Whitehall sources.The new offence of public sexual harassment is seen as a more effective way of protecting women against violence than classing misogyny as a hate crime alongside race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity, Whitehall sources have said.The Law Commission also decided it could make it harder to prosecute crimes such as domestic abuse and would create two-tier sentencing, depending on whether a sexual offence was shown to be a hate crime.The move will be part of a week of government crime announcements, which include a crackdown on drug gangs, a new law to put victims at the heart of the criminal justice system, and prison reforms to reduce reoffending by getting more inmates into work.A Whitehall source said: “The Law Commission is not going to class misogyny as a hate crime because it would be ineffective and in some cases counterproductive.“But it will call for a public sexual harassment offence, which doesn’t currently exist. It thinks this fits with other work the Government is doing on criminalising intimate image abuse and will be more productive and better in protecting women.”The Law Commission review of hate crimes was ordered three years ago by Sajid Javid, then Home Secretary.It has since become even more important following the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard by Wayne Couzens, a serving politan Police officer, which sparked a huge national debate on violence against women.In the wake of Miss Everard\u0027s killing, ministers said they would consider if there should be a new offence of street harassment that would criminalise explicit sexual and abusive behaviour or comments made in public.Draft legislation prepared by campaigners covers behaviour including intentionally pressing against someone on public transport, persistent sexual propositioning or cornering someone, making sexually explicit comments, leering at a person and cat-calling.It makes clear that police and prosecutors would have to show the behaviour would cause “harassment, distress or alarm” with an intent to “humiliate or degrade” an alleged victim.Dr Charlotte Proudman, a barrister who helped draft the proposed bill, said it would also have to be in the public interest to prosecute. “It could be someone shouting degrading, humiliating comments with lewd language to a woman walking down the street that makes them feel unsafe,” she said.“If someone came up to you in a pub, didn’t leave you alone, made foul comments about your body, and was persistently following you around, maybe that would be captured.”It is understood ministers are in favour of the new offences proposed by the Law Commission, as long as it can be shown that they plug gaps in current laws for common assault and public order breaches. Recommendations made by the Law Commission are generally accepted by the Government.Priti Patel said earlier this year that police must “raise the bar” by taking harassment and flashing of women more seriously after Ms Everard’s death.The Home Secretary said verbal or physical abuse of women in the street were not “low-level” crimes and could lead to more serious offences. Ms Everard’s killer had previously escaped prosecution for alleged flashing offences.Nimco Ali, the feminist campaigner advising the Government on its violence against women strategy, said new legislation was needed to show such behaviour was unacceptable.“It’s like seatbelt laws or the smoking ban. In order for social norms to change, you have to have legislation and then society will police it,” she said.But the decision not to make misogyny a hate crime is likely to face a backlash from women’s groups, as it would have enabled police and prosecutors to ask for tougher sentences for some crimes against women.The Law Commission is also expected to propose extending the offence of stirring up hatred to include provoking violence on the grounds of gender.That is partly in response to the Incel movement - involuntarily celibate men, some of whom have been responsible for violent and fatal attacks on women.It will also strengthen protections for freedom of speech, so that offensive dinner table comments made in private are not be classed as hate crimes.More from NewsArthur Labinjo-Hughes: Life must mean life for \u0026#39evil\u0026#39 child murderers, say former ministersIn the Republicans’ Game of Thrones, somebody needs to step up and kill the kingExclusive: Meet ‘Director K’, the MI5 spy responsible for keeping Britain safe from China and RussiaAlleged bullying of Palace staff sparked Kate and Meghan rowCovid travel \u0026#39loophole\u0026#39 allows passengers to reuse PCR test codesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tony blair owes lady may apology","story":"Theresa May read David Harkins’ poem ‘She is gone’ at this week’s memorial service to the much-loved Tory MP Dame Cheryl Gillan, who died in April.The former prime minister was styled “The Right Honourable Lady May” in the Order of Service produced for the congregation at St Margaret’s Church just over the road from the Palace of Westminster. While she will continue to be styled “The Right Honourable Theresa May MP” in public life, in private she has decided to be known as “Lady May” after her husband Philip was knighted for his political service to the country.But it seems odd to me that May has not been honoured by the Queen in her own right.

Image: UGCByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Dec | commentsUnite leader Sharon Graham has said Labour should take their Old Bexley  Sidcup by-election loss as just that - a loss. Ms Graham said the party will continue to take a hit at the ballot box unless they speak up for workers and communities. Celebrating her  days as general secretary of the union, Ms Graham said she is proud of her wins so far but insists she has a lot more in the pipeline because workers are being battered and communities are suffering. She told the Mirror: Itaposs my responsibility to fight bad bosses until politicians get their act together.I want Labour to do well. Theoretically they should be fighting for workers and communities butthey donapost lead the fight for workers and communities people will question the relevance of the Labour Party.There is no point waiting until election time to talk about their dficulties because people will say, aposhang on a second, where were you when I needed you apos  When askedLabour were right to feel confident following the by-election results, Ms Graham told the Mirror: Labour lost the by-election. Thataposs the outcome.It comes after Labour said Boris Johnson should be “worried” about the Old Bexley  Sidcup by election results as voters are showing that they are fed up of his jokes and fed up of following rules the Tories ignore.With the lowest voter turnout of any by-election held this year so far, the Tories managed to hold onto the Old Bexley and Sidcup seat. But even though Tory candidate Louie French took more than half the votes in the contest, a turnout of just % means the Conservatives’ majority was slashed from almost , to ,, giving Labour a % swing.If a  per cent swing is replicated at the next general election, the PM could lose his own Uxbridge and Ruislip South seat.Shadow Solicitor General Ellie Reeves celebrated the result, claiming the Labour swing in a Tory heartland seat shows people are seeing the PM’s “incompetence”. “A swing of .% in a Tory stronghold, carried across the country in a General Election, would have Labour within reach of a majority Government,” she said. “Voters have been telling us that they are fed up of being taken for granted, fed up of being told to live by a set of rules that is ignored by the government and fed up with the sleaze.“Serious times call for serious leadership and people are ready to give Keir Starmer a hearing.” Mr French won with , votes. The Labour candidate, Daniel Francis, took second place with ,and Richard Tice, the leader of the Reform party, came third on , votes . The by-election follows the death of former Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire who died of lung cancer earlier this year, aged . He was elected in the  election with a majority of , to the suburban London seat. Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said he was “really not terribly worried about Labour” after the Tory majority was slashed in the Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election.Mr Dowden told Sky News: “This is a good result for a governing party mid-term. As you well know, governing parties shouldn’t expect to do well mid-term. We actually secured over % of the vote in Bexley. I pay tribute to our excellent candidate and the campaign team there that secured that result.“This idea that Labour have made some surge ahead is really for the birds. They’ve actually got about the same vote share as they secured under Jeremy Corbyn in .“Keir Starmer couldn’t even be bothered to turn up to the by-election, so I am really not terribly worried about Labour.”  Deputy Tory party chairman Justin Tomlinson saidLabour were “serious” about being a potential alternative Government they should be “running us very, very close”. He claimed voters in Old Bexley and Sidcup were not focused on Downing Street Christmas party allegations. Labour’s national campaign co-ordinator, Shabana Mahmood, said the Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election result means people are seeing Keir Starmer as a good fit for becoming Prime Minister. “In the conversations that I had, more and more people are taking a second look at the Labour Party and more and more people are concluding that Keir Starmer would make a better prime minister of this country. “So, as I say, I take great heart from that.” The Prime Minister will not visit the Old Bexley  Sidcup constituency but instead will visit the North Shropshire on Friday ahead of their by-election on December . But he did not visit the Old Bexley  Sidcup constituency his party won. The North Shropshire vote follows the resignation of Conservative MP Owen Paterson, who was found to have breached parliamentary rules on lobbying.

Glossing over contradictory advice from his own ministers in recent days, he said: “There’s been quite a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, people concerned they need to cancel Christmas parties. “That’s not right, we’re not saying that... Christmas should go ahead as normally as possible.” But asked what he had to say to bereaved families following our revelations that No hosted parties last year in breach of lockdown restrictions he said: “What I’ve said throughout, since this thing was brought up, was that’s not true, we’ve followed the guidance throughout.”  Yesterday one leading scientist publicly said he would not feel safe going to an Xmas bash.

The Government department launched a review earlier this year “into respect and inclusion” following accusations of racism. A draft presentation ahead of the review was shared with all staff as part of a series, So Let’s Talk About Race, in a bid to shine a light on experiences of staff. In the slides, seen by the Press Association, black civil servants shared horrying accounts of alleged racism. One member of staff said they would not put their photo on internal services because I donapost want people to know Iaposm black before they meet me.  Another said a member of their team had only appointed white men, and when challenged on not appointing a colleague with a Nigerian name, they said it was because aposno-one can pronounce their nameapos and aposI donapost understand them when they speakapos. A further employee said: Things reached a very low point for me about what is happening in certain parts of the department when I was told by a colleague that someone had attempted to take their own le because of prolonged racial bullying. According to the slides the presentations were sponsored by Sir John Manzoni, who was chief executive of the civil service and the Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary from  to April , and Simon Tse, the Crown Commercial Service chief executive and Cabinet Office Race Champion. The PCS union, which represents civil servants, called the accusations utterly shocking. PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka wrote to Mr Chisholm last December raising concerns about bullying following the Civil Service People Survey. At that time, he said that large numbers of black and ethnic minority staff had complained to the union about prejudice. He also said disabled staff faced direct and indirect discrimination at work. The Cabinet Office has a cross-Government role and describes itself as the corporate headquarters of the Civil Service.The department - which was headed by Michael Gove until September when he was replaced by Steve Barclay - said improvements had been made, and this was reflected in the most recent staff survey. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: The Cabinet Office does not tolerate bullying, harassment or discrimination in any form. We sought out these experiences precisely to help make our workspace more inclusive. “This is a vital part of our commitment to set a new standard for ersity and inclusion, as set out in the Declaration on Government Reform. While our latest data shows a decline in reported incidents of discrimination, there is always more we can do. “Our Respect and Inclusion review will build on the improvements made in recent years by considering our policies, practices and workplace culture, supported by specialist external advice. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said he was not aware of the specic case. He added: I think youaposve heard the Prime Minister say before that racism has no role whatsoever in our society. Iaposm not aware of that inidual case and I donapost think itaposd be appropriate for me to comment on it. A PCS spokesman said: While we welcome the Cabinet Office launching a review, it is disgraceful that PCS is being excluded from the full process by not being allowed a seat on the project management committee. It is unacceptable that the full Cabinet Office report will be withheld from unions when PCS and others are the ones who have highlighted the appalling examples of racism within the department. Only by a full and transparent process can we begin to give confidence to staff that their concerns are being addressed and that there will be a signicant culture sht within the Cabinet Office.

But the government has made it perfectly clearopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec The annual declaration by the Prime Minister that Christmas should go ahead as planned is swtly becoming a festive tradition.Recent history has shown it is followed by a gt-wrapped ban on household mixing, the twinkling fairy lights of forcibly separated families, and the merry jingle of a Downing Street lock-in. In fact, the sight of Boris Johnson stepping up to a podium and glumly announcing that everything he said two weeks ago has turned out to be wrong creates exactly the same feeling in the hearts of watching children as watching the first snow flake fall, and then seeing it melt on contact with the ground. If the PM had any sense of occasion, heaposd pay Noddy Holder to burst out of the Downing Street curtains yodelling: ITaposS CHRIIIIIIIIISTMAAAAAAAAS! And then weaposd all know exactly where we stood. There remains, however, a confusing degree of iation in how weaposre supposed to observe and participate in the upcoming festive season, with constant mutations of the rules that are actually guidance, but still called rules, and some of which you can be prosecuted for and some you wonapost. So far, weaposve survived the Barnard Castle iant, which damaged the eyesight so much you couldnapost drive but had to self-diagnose while driving the Hancock iant, in which you could snog anyone youaposre not married to so long as it was necessary for work and the Nimco iant, that made support bubbles deflate quicker than an anti-vaxxeraposs confidence after being moved to the ICU.Now, after failing to vaccinate members of the government from the urge to present themselves as freedom fighters, we have been struck by the super-mutant OhmiGOD iant, which originated in Downing Street and makes people do whatever the hell they feel like because why should they care, right  But as politicians are very fond of saying, let me be perfectly clear - the rules have been widely published, and apply to everyone equally. They are as follows:  . You should minimise all social contact, except at Christmas parties where everyone deserves a good knees-up, according to multiple government ministers. Only gatherings that are absolutely necessary for work should take place, according to other government ministers, but this may include Secret Santas, quizzes, and boozy leaving-dos. There is no requirement to ban household mixing, except when London was in Tier  last year when the Prime Ministeraposs household reportedly mixed quite a lot but no-one  was allowed to. Mixing your drinks IS allowed, but donapost forget it is NOT advised to mix the grape with the grain. Banging heads all round. The guidance is that you should go on holiday, attend the nativity play, and hold Christmas parties, especiallyany of these things are being paid for by a millionaire friend of the family and the polls say youaposre bullet-proof. . When it comes to mistletoe, your father is allowed to be aposhandsyapos beneath it, although this is also indecent assault and carries a maximum sentence of  years in prison . You can snog anyone the co-chairman of the Conservative Party Oliver Dowden approves of, but you shouldnapost snog too much in case it upsets Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey . Health Secretary Sajid Javid says you can snog absolutely anybody, so long as you do so cautiously, with just a bit of tongue . After you have avoided jail, disciplinary action, or a firm slap, obtained written approval, and had Sajid measure the amount of tongue slipped to a colleague and classied this as aposcautiousapos, you must wear a mask on your bus home or face a £ fine.

And finally, of course, you are exempt from every rule ever writtenyou are put in genuine distress by not having to do much to not kill other people, or you are called Boris.  If you are caught breaking any of the rules, accused of not understanding them, orit is gently pointed out by a psychiatrist that you appear to be living in an alternative reality where the laws of physics, chemistry and biology are apparently as optional as your moral compass, there is a quick-fix solution. You just insist you followed all the rules, while making the rules as confusing as possible, so that nobody knows what the rules are and whether you followed them or not.You then add that you do not recognise any of the logical and factual things being put to you, which makes those questioning you start to question reality itself, and merely despair of you.The sum of all this unaccountability is that the country that has been entrusted to your care does not know which way is up, its people are left to fend for themselves, and the noisy minority of ar**holes can claim to be the silent majority who wishes everyone  were dead and does all they can to make it happen.It doesnapost matter, because you can blame fat people, old people, sick people, or stupid people, and the voter doesnapost realise youaposre talking about them, so will keep giving you % of the vote even in mid-term by-elections in a badly-handled pandemic, with , dead and consequence-free law-breaking in the building where our laws are written, by the people who write them.Merry Christmas, everybody.

The Levelling Up Secretary said he is “deeply disappointed” with the F team’s decision to accept the deal with cladding firm Kingspan.He called on the team to drop the partnership with Kingspan as the deal would “undermine” the achievements Mercedes and Sir Lewis Hamilton have made in British sporting history.Mercedes F boss Toto Wolff apologised to Grenfell Tower survivors and bereaved relatives who wrote to him. He said it was not their intention to cause “additional hurt” by accepting a sponsorship deal with Kingspan. But he did not say the F team will drop the sponsorship deal. This is despite fresh criticism from Mr Gove’s Labour counterpart, Lisa Nandy who welcomed Mr Gove’s swt criticisms of the F team’s actions.Ms Nandy, however, went a step further to criticise Mr Gove and accuse him of hypocrisy. Kingspanaposs K insulation was one of the products installed on Grenfell Tower during its refurbishment, although the majority of the insulation used on the west London tower block was made by another company. Writing to Mr Gove, Ms Nandy highlighted the Tories had taken political donations from developers who use the same cladding that caused the tragedy.She added: “For almost four and a half years, the victims of the Grenfell tragedy have fought tirelessly for justice. Michael Gove was absolutely right to call out this deeply insensitive and inappropriate decision, buthe wants to take a principled stance then he needs to look closer to home.“To criticise others while his own Party takes hundreds of thousands in political donations from developers that use the same dangerous cladding that caused the Grenfell Tower fire is nothing short of rank hypocrisy.  Apologising to families who had lost loved ones in the fire, Mr Wolff said: “The tragedy of the Grenfell Tower fire was beyond imaginable to me, and it should never have happened. On behalf of our team, I would sincerely like to apologise to you for the additional hurt that this announcement has caused. It was never our intention to do so. “The work of the public inquiry to establish the full causes of the tragedy is crucially important. Prior to concluding our partnership, we engaged with Kingspan in depth to understand what role their products played in what happened at Grenfell. “Kingspan have stated that they played no role in the design or construction of the cladding system on Grenfell Tower, and that a small percentage of their product was used as a substitute without their knowledge in part of the system which was not compliant with building regulations and was unsafe. “I know that this does not change in any way the awful tragedy you suffered, or the deep and ongoing pain felt in your community, and I would like to thank Grenfell United for the offer to meet in person for me to learn and understand better.”  But Mr Gove said in his letter to the Mercedes F team: “I note your defence of Kingspan’s actions in your letter to Grenfell United of  December. “However the Government’s formal representations during the Grenfell Inquiry noted that Kingspan employees knew their products were more combustible than they were advertising them to be.” He added: “The achievements of Mercedes and Sir Lewis Hamilton in recent years represent a British success story of which we are all proud. I hope you will reconsider this commercial partnership, which threatens to undermine all the good work the company and sport have done.” The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said: “I haven’t spoken to the PM specically about this issue. You’ve seen the tweet Michael Gove sent out on this subject. More generally I’d point to the action we are taking to improve building safety.” An inquiry is examining how Grenfell Tower came to be coated in flammable materials which contributed to the spread of flames which shot up the tower in June , killing  people. Ms Nandy also called on driver Lewis Hamilton to make his views “clearly known”.Mr Hamilton has previously written about the Grenfell Tower fire on his Instagram account.In  he posted a picture with a caption that said: “Today marks three years since the horric Grenfell Tower fire in London. “Remembering the  souls we lost and their loved ones, and everyone affected by this tragedy.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Lewis HamiltonMichael GoveGrenfell Tower fire\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

While many have banned flights from African countries, some introduced tighter restrictions like mandatory vaccines and tracking to watch the movements of confirmed cases.Here’s what other countries are doing to stop the spread of the Omicron iant of coronavirus.Poland Has banned flights from seven African countries, extended quarantine for some travellers and further limited the numbers allowed into places such as restaurants.

However, this week I was green with envy as Barbadians held a massive shindig to celebrate becoming a republic. Rihanna dazzled as Prince Charles sweated and waffled about the “atrocity of slavery” while the British state he will soon be the head of refuses to pay reparations to the descendants of those slaves. Not that he’d have a say in it. In fact, despite the weird letters he sends to ministers pushing his wacky causes and protecting the £million he earns annually from the Duchy of Cornwall, he won’t have a real say in anything when he’s king. He’ll be as pointless as the valet he pays to put toothpaste on his brush. I won’t join the royalist orgy next year when the Queen’s reign hits  but I’ll admit the plaudits she’ll receive for dedicating herself to the service of her country will be well deserved. The problem for us Republicans is that she has infantilised a nation whose older citizens cling to the black-and-white Britain she links us to, like Jacob Rees-Mogg to his nanny’s apron. But she will be gone soon and when she is, would it be too much to ask for an honest debate about whether the monarchy should go too   Would it be such a bad thing for us to work outwe’d like to follow the path of other grown-up democracies, like Barbados, and elect our head of state rather than have the next royal accident of birth imposed by this one family  Imagine what we could do with all those palaces, not to mention the £ million a year it costs to let them live like dukes and princesses. What a farce those titles are.The Sussexes of Montecito, Calornia, have as much claim on Sussex as my Romanian rescue dog. Same with the Cambridges and the Kents. As for the Yorks, what has that fine city done to deserve the gruesome twosome Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson taking its name  What priceless gall the royal spinners have, painting Meghan Markle as the spawn of the devil, then whistling into the wind when the grand old Duke of York’s name comes up.I think we’d be doing the Royals a favour because judging by the recent two-part BBC documentary on the princes, they look as miserable as sin, while most of them resent us for prolonging their goldfish bowl existence. The current House of Windsor appears to be a backbiting bitchfest where everyone spins and lies to curry favour. And for what  They hate the press, the BBC, makers of The Crown and each other almost as much as doing a proper job. So when the Good Ship Lizzie sails into the sunset, why not let all the Royals, like the Montecito miserabilistsFind Freedom. Permanently. We have nothing to lose but our tugged forelocks.

George Dowell, , and Jessikah Lopez, , started sharing their relationship online to show other people with disabilities that they can still enjoy a relationship with able-bodied people as romantic partners. Owner of Worthing Football Club, George had stopped looking for love after he was left paralysed from the chest down in a car accident in .But despite failing to find a match when he featured on the Channel  programme Undateables three years ago, he had unknowingly caught Jessikah’s eye, who started following him on social media. After the pair got chatting they met up and got together in November  and have been “inseparable” since - but have still had to face online trolls who suggest their relationship can’t be genuine. Jessikah, who works as Georgeaposs PA said: “When I saw George was on the Undateables I thought he was attractive and confident, and thought it was an interesting story. “We get lots of questions about our romantic relationship “I have had people that have commented suggesting that I have an ulterior motive and that I’m not really with George because I love him.  “One lady called me out saying that I was using George for his money and that people need to watch out for girls like me. “We’ve even had other people in wheelchairs asking usour relationship is real and question why I would want to be with George. “That means nothing, just because you see me in that way doesn’t mean that everyone  does. “It’s offensive to me and it’s offensive to George because it suggests that he isn’t worthy.”Despite facing a small amount of negativity, the couple have seen an overwhelmingly positive response to their Instagram and Youtube page ‘The Wheel Le’. The couple help other people by myth-busting misconceptions around interabled relationships and answer productive questions about their intimate le, dating and their general day to day activities. George was able-bodied and an avid football player until the age of , when he was involved in a paralysing car crash with his friends after practice. At the time of the incident, he was supported by his then girlfriend, but the couple later split amicably for other reasons. As he came to terms with his le-changing injury, George began focussing on other aspects of his le as he feared that potential new girlfriends would struggle to look past his wheelchair.  He said: “We had just finished football practice and decided to drive to the local McDonalds to get some food. “We were on our way back when we had a freak accident.“The road was empty, we weren’t speeding and it wasn’t bad weather conditions, the car just flipped three or four times off the road.“At  you have your whole le ahead of you, I was playing football as much as possible and it was my dream to play as high a level as I could but that just completely went out the window overnight. “I didn’t want to approach girls because I had that fear of being rejected because of my injury. “I thought, ‘whataposs the point in approaching girls  there are plenty of guys out there not in wheelchairs’.” But after meeting Jessikah George was keen to show other people in similar situations that you can and will find love again. Jessikah said: “I’m still shocked at how much support we have had, it’s made us really want to do it even more. “Some things are dferent in our relationship because of George’s injury, but every relationship is dferent in its own way and has its own complexities.” George added: “It feels amazing to help other people and hear some of the stories from our followers. “If it helps just one other person it’s all been worth it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Channel UndateablesLoveCar crashes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Gareth Holliday, , has been looking for a place to live through a council’s approved estate agents for months. He hopes to find a place before Christmas so he can see his babies after his eight-year marriage ended this year. Gareth says that, after putting enquiries to estate agents, he often finds the day before his viewing the landlord has gone with another tenant. He has been couch surfing for months and says he is starting to think his pets and his appearance are preventing him from finding a place to live.  He has a licence for his four-foot African dwarf caiman crocodile called Missy and an -foot snake. Adur and Worthing Councils said that “physical appearance” was not in their criteria for applications for housing. They said they have been in contact with Gareth and had previously put him up in a hotel. Gareth, who is a recovering drug addict, left the hotel on the advice of his doctor and he says he was only provided with a microwave to make his meals.

The six-year-old was living with his paternal grandparents, who “loved and cherished him”, when the pandemic hit. But his dad Thomas Hughes decided to move in with girlfriend Emma Tustin when the country was plunged into lockdown.Today his evil stepmum convicted of murdering the defenceless child after a horric campaign of abuse, while his dad was found guilty of manslaughter.Det Insp Laura Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said it “was the worst decision that could have been made”. “If only Hughes had left Arthur with his grandparents who absolutely doted on him, loved him and cherished him,” she told the Mirror. “The manipulation and the toxic relationship between Tustin and Hughes meant the family were cut out of Arthur’s le and didnapost play a part. “The lockdown meant professionals didn’t have the opportunity to monitor him in the same way they would do with children normally. “I do think that lockdown contributed. “The professionals who would ordinarily have been involved in Arthur’s le, such as teachers, weren’t having that contact with him and spotting changes in his behaviour or bruises on his body. “Tustin and Hughes cut off family members so Arthur was no longer seeing or speaking to him. “And when social workers went out to Tustin’s home there was an absolute manipulation of them by the defendants. “It was the only day when Arthur was allowed to play in the garden and he presented very dferently as a result. “When the professionals did speak to him they weren’t picking up on the signs they would have donehe had been segregated in a hallway. “Tustin and Hughes pulled the wood over the eyes of the professionals. They didn’t want children’s services involved.” Specialist grief counsellors were drafted in to help police left traumatised by Arthur’s death.  Veteran detectives were left in tears as they watched CCTV footage of the helpless youngster alone in his family home. They also discovered harrowing evidence that Arthur had been sadistically poisoned with salt by his dad and step-mum. DI Harrison described it as the “most traumatic” case she had ever investigated. She compared his death to the murder of Daniel Pelka, the tragic four-year-old boy killed by his mum and step-dad in . In both cases the children were deliberately poisoned with salt to increase the suffering before their deaths. “I knew when we started it was a horric case, but there have been moments that have just completely got me,” she said.  “Everyone involved has found it really haunting having to witness and experience the evil and horric torture that Arthur was subjected to. “There are real similarities with Daniel Pelka, definitely in terms of salt poisoning. “I’d not heard of it before in child cruelty cases and it’s been really hard to comprehend. But it is a haunting parallel. “A physical assault is one thing - but it’s very devious and manipulative to dose a child up with salt. It’s another level of evil. “It could only have been done as another way to control Arthur - an extra punishment. “We think maybe they did it to make him more thirsty but we don’t know because they’ve never given us an explanation. “It’s been really dficult for the officers who have to sit for hours watching CCTV footage of Arthur being isolated.  “I arranged for a trauma counsellor to come in to explain the emotions people might be experiencing and to teach coping mechanisms they could put in place. “They have been able to independently see the counsellor without the rest of the team knowing. “We don’t ordinarily get faced with CCTV like this. “The footage really got to the heart of what Arthur was being subjected to and thataposs why it’s been so hard-hitting and dferent to similar cases. “When you add in the  recordings of Arthur in distress and the brutal text messages, it sets it apart from the Pelka and Baby P cases. “We’ve been reliant on medical expert opinion and it’s been crucial. “But the actual emotional element of this case has been proved by that CCTV or hearing audio clips where he is calling out for family members, calling out for food or water, and that nobody loves him. “We all know children in our lives. You just cannot comprehend anybody being able to neglect a child over such a sustained period of time. “It was not a sudden loss of control, it was a well thought-out campaign of abuse, both physically and psychologically, towards Arthur.” DI Harrison said it was “hard to comprehend” how Hughes and Tustin tried to blame Arthur for his fatal injuries. She said: “They’ve blamed each other and they’ve blamed Arthur as well. “How can a six-year-old boy be responsible for what happened  We know he couldn’t have inflicted his fatal injuries himself. “They are both equally responsible. Although Tustin killed Arthur, Hughes encouraged the killing by actions.” The sheer cruelty of the couple was played out in the courtroom over two months. Texts between them showed their feelings towards the little boy, whose mother was previously jailed for the manslaughter of her boyfriend. In brutal messages, Hughes told Tustin to aposjust endapos Arthur and also apostake his jaw offapos and aposgagapos him. He also threatened to apostake his neck offapos and aposdash my food off his headapos. The day before the child died, his dad texted about paying someone to aposdig Arthuraposs graveapos. Tustin was equally vile, the court was told. In one message she said aposf****** launch this lying little f***apos and in another she warned she was aposgoing to chin this little c***apos.

Simon says things are so bad that thereaposs vermin - and he refuses to allow his grandchildren into the caravan. But he says he and the children he lives would should be able to stay together.  He said: I donapost want us to separate - theyaposve been through so much since losing their mother and now we just need somewhere to go. Weaposre washing with cold water, we canapost clean our clothes properly, weaposve no toilets, and the rats are getting in. I canapost bring any of my grandkids up here as itaposs too dangerous, and we feel like because weaposre hiding away at the back here we get forgotten about. Thereaposs no heater, weaposre freezing through the night and can hear the rats scratching around. Weaposd love to plug in a Christmas tree - we havenapost even had one for about eight years. The council have been down, but thereaposs been no updates and weaposve no ideaweaposre going to get out of here. Community Development Officer for the East Cork Traveller Project Amy Hyland has been liaising with the family over the past few months. She described the situation as quite bad and getting worse. She said itaposs not just Simonaposs family either, and that itaposs one of Irelandaposs biggest hidden problems.  We only have one person who we link in with the council, the Traveller Liaison Officer, and theyaposre the only one we know can get stuff done, but you come across challenges constantly. Even when it comes to private rented accommodation thereaposs a lot of discrimination against traveller families. These families face a massive battle. Liaising with the council can be a slow process, although their one officer works really hard and does her best she has to cover so many families across the whole county. But even with that we need landlords who are willing to house and support traveller families on top of the council.  I see lots of people get to the point where theyaposre approved for HAP but then even with that canapost get accommodation, I was a year-and-a-half trying to help one girl get somewhere and it was all down to the simple fact that landlords were ignoring her once they realised she was a traveller. Theyaposre human and they deserve the same treatment as anyone . Iaposd ask landlords out there whoaposve got accommodation to make it available. A Cork County Council spokesperson said: Cork County Council does not comment on inidual cases. Any person can apply for social housing supports. If they are deemed eligible and have a housing need, then they may qualy for social housing supports. If qualied there are a number of dferent options available. Qualied applicants can avail of the Housing Assistance Payment . Cork County Council has a ‘Place Finder’ service and Tenancy Sustainment Officers who will assist applicants in this process.

Guess what  I dont care, writes Anila BaigAmir Khan got so much abuse and even received a death threat when he posted a picture on social media of his tree with his little daughter excitedly opening presents. Classy Image: Getty Images iStockphotoopinionBy Anila Baig:,  Dec | commentsIt is officially the season of goodwill to all mankind - unless you are a Muslim who is committing an unspeakable crime. The radio might be blaring out It’s Christmas time, there’s no need to be afraid,” but some of us are very scared indeed. What is this heinous act a section of the Muslim community indulges in  It is the crime of putting up a Christmas tree. Forget hanging up baubles and tinsel, there are those who think putting up a tree or getting into the festive spirit should be a hangable offence. Yep, just as December gets under way the predictable comments on social media from some sections of the community are coming thick and fast. “Muslims buying Christmas trees, what has the world come to  This is totally haram ,” they cry. Haram means the opposite of halal - so not permitted.There are some who even go as far as to say wishing someone a Merry Christmas is against the religion. Er, no, it isn’t. It’s haram-less, in my opinion. I don’t understand why some people get so het up about the whole thing. Bolton boxer Amir Khan got so much abuse and even received a death threat when he posted a picture on social media of his full bodied tree with his little daughter excitedly opening presents. Classy. Footballer Mohammed Salah got exactly the same treatment. “He is Muslim, he shouldn’t be putting up a Christmas tree. And his daughter should be wearing a headscarf!” were some of the comments I saw. I feel sorry for these Christmas killjoys. True, we didn’t have a tradition of putting up Christmas trees when we were younger. We were brought up in a strict Muslim household but that didn’t mean we didn’t acknowledge Christmas. Quite the opposite in fact. I have lovely memories of sitting at the feet of my parents helping to wrap presents while they wrote out cards to distribute to their Christian friends and neighbours. It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling especially as neither of them are here anymore. My mum and dad were both so proud when my younger brother bagged the coveted role of Joseph in the school nativity - Jesus is, after all, regarded as a prominent figure in our own Islamic faith. We don’t have a tradition of celebrating the birth of our prophets, but that doesn’t mean we object to anyone  enjoying their festivals.  And what do trees really have to do with Christmas  They were only introduced relatively recently in this country when Queen Victoria and Prince Albert popularised the German tradition in the s. They look warm and twinkly and brighten up a room on these dreary dark nights. The irony is that I always see lots of Muslim families in the run-up to Christmas at the supermarket stocking up on spuds and Brussel sprouts and boxes of crackers, while our Pakistani butchers have been taking orders for halal turkeys for years. At the end of the day there are far bigger issues to get het up about than whether someone has put up a tree. I don’t recall hearing the same outrage over the disgusting men who were jailed earlier this week for a litany of crimes against young girls in the north of England. Now that really is crackers.

Residents living in Enderby Gardens, Middlesbrough, have spoken of their terror following stabbings, shootings and an arson attack in the area, say reports.One woman, Victoria Fairbridge, , said she has been the victim of harassment from teenage gangs since Halloween, reports Teesside Live.From throwing stones and pumpkins at her windows to threatening her family, the yobs have caused her to feel like sheaposs no longer safe in the area sheaposs lived most of her le. A mum to a six-year-old with a recently diagnosed heart condition and an eight-year-old on the autistic spectrum, Victoria said her children have been targeted as well when sheaposs asked the thugs to leave her property.  She said: It all started just before Halloween, they started throwing things at the house and I asked them nicely to leave so they didnapost disturb my kids. They began to kick off at me and told me that they were going to aposbeat the disabled outapos of my son and aposcut his head offapos. Victoria believes that the group harassing her family are aged  to , and claimed they are always covered with scarves, balaclavas and dark clothing so theyaposre almost impossible to identy and report. As well as her house, Victoria said that groups of youths are terrorising houses all over Hemlington and have even started abusing her next door neighbours. She added: Iaposve lived in Hemlington almost all my le and itaposs never been this bad, we never used to cause trouble when I was growing up.  My neighbour politely asked a groupthey could go away from our houses as theyaposre scaring the kids and she was laughed at. The abuse and language that comes out of their mouths is absolutely disgraceful. Victoria said she has been urged to leave her house and move where, but she explained itaposs not that simple to do so. She said: The ideal situation would be to move house of course, but itaposs not easy. Iaposm a single mum of two boys, one with a newly diagnosed heart condition and another with autism so they need so much care. I canapost afford private rent and Iaposm not in the position to move anywhere  as times are hard. The Sun reports that other families have also complained about the thuggish behaviour. Dad-of-four Peter Thomson said: There was a shooting around the corner. Just outside our house a taxi driver was robbed by people with machetes. The teenagers walk around with balaclavas on and they go about terrorising the estate. Iaposve had motorbikes stolen from my garden. Iaposve had to spend over £ on CCTV and a cage to stop the theft. A lad around the corner had bricks put through his windows. He said things had become so bad that even the police are scared of them. Amy Hughes who has lived on the estate for seven years said she is often too scared to leave her home. The -year-old, who currently isnapost working due to ill health, claimed yobs had set her bins alight as well as putting bricks and stones through windows.  She added there had also been stabbings in the area. Cleveland Police said in a statement: “Police have been working with local agencies including the council and housing to help tackle the issues that have been reported, including regular patrols in this area by local authority street wardens.There is continued work ongoing with partner agencies to address the problems and we would continue to urge anyone who has been a victim of crime or antisocial behaviour to report it to police on , or call Crimestoppers on   .” Kay Glew, director of operations at Thirteen Housing Group, added: “The safety and security of our customers is extremely important to us and we have been working closely with Ms Fairbridge and our community partners in the police and council to address the issues that she has raised.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cleveland PoliceTeenagers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The heavy goods vehicle crashed on the A Speke Road in Widnes, Cheshire, during rush hour traffic today, December , at .am. No one was injured in the crash but crews were called in to remove the lorry and part of the damaged gantry. The westbound carriageway was closed to drivers and several ersions put in place. Cheshire Police said: Emergency services are working hard to clear the closure as soon as possible but the road is expected to be closed for several hours. Workmen carried out repairs and tests to ensure the gantry was structurally sound before drivers could be allowed to drive under it.  Routes were erted, including the Mersey Gateway Bridge westbound and the Silver Jubilee Bridge heading north. Just days ago, a lucky trucker walked away unscathed after a crash which crushed the cab of his lorry. Police who were stunned at his pure luck advised him to buy a lottery ticket after the collision. The HGV driver was left with only one small cut to his head after stepping out of his cab which resembled “a concertina”. Somehow the trucker ducked into a tiny space as he crashed and saved himself from being mangled to death in his battered lorry.Police were stunned and said he was incredibly lucky to escape death before joking that he should buy a lottery ticket after his narrow escape. His lorry had smashed into the back of another HGV on the M motorway in Derbyshire on Tuesday. The first vehicle came to halt on the slow lane of the northbound carriageway between junction A and  after suffering a tyre blow out. A second lorry was unable to stop and ploughed into the back of the -wheeler sending debris scattering across both sides of the motorway. Last month a motorist managed to inform a lorry driver in the adjacent lane that he was careering down the motorway with a white VW latched on his front bumper. The panicked motorist can be seen waving his arms, trying to get the Gregaposs Couriers lorry to realise another vehicle has tagged along for the ride. As he waves, the motorist can be heard yelling: F*****g stop! He points towards the front of the multi-ton vehicle and adds: Stop you f****** idiot. The HGV driver then realises whataposs happened and pulls over to the hard shoulder. Both the trucker and the VW driver - who was  or  - escaped unscathed.

David McEntee, , explained that it has always been at the back of his mind to attempt the mega trip, MyLondon report.He walked along the Grand Union Canal from its start point in Little Venice all the way up to the Midlands where it ends. The hiking enthusiast says the  mile-walk was worth it - even though he wasnapost raising money for charity, like most others who attempt such expeditions. He videoed the whole journey and says it was a trip he has wanted to tackle since he was a youngster. He said: “People would ask me… ‘Where are you off to ’ To which I would reply ‘Birmingham!’ and laugh at their astonished reactions. ‘Thataposs a few hundred miles away isn’t itapos   “Ever since I was a child I was fascinated by the Canal. I decided I would walk the whole route from end to end. I did it to satisfy that childhood wonder for the canal, I did it to get to know an area that I perceive to be in my back garden - and I did it to satisfy my cravings for an adventure! “A highlight of the London section was passing ‘Paradise fields’ which are aptly named. Full of massive trees and a whistling population of birds, this stretch was beautul and extremely peaceful. For a good  minutes I completely forgot I was in London.  He is now turning his skills to building out his own UK Adventure  hiking focused YouTube channel.

The two women were introduced when Meghan started dating the monarchaposs grandson, Prince Harry.And at first, the two women struck up a sweet bond with their shared love of dogs and attended an engagement together. But after less than two years as a working royal Meghan - along with Harry - stepped down from The Firm, with the pair leaving the UK for America. Since she left in , Meghan has yet toto the UK and the Queen has yet to meet her new great-granddaughter Lilibet. Here we look back at the early stages of their relationship and where it is at now... Joining the family It was in November  when it was officially announced that Meghan would be joining the Royal Family following her engagement to Prince Harry. To mark the event, both Harry and Meghan gave an interview, where Meghan talked about her first meeting with the monarch lavishing her with praise. She said: Itaposs incredible, I think, you know, to be able to meet her through [Harryaposs] lens, not just with this honour and respect for her as the monarch, but the love that he has for her as his grandmother, all of those layers have been so important for me so that when I met her I had such a deep understanding and of course incredible respect for being able to have that time with her. And weaposve had a really – sheaposs – sheaposs an incredible woman. Love of dogs Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.In the same interview, Harry revealed how his grandmotheraposs love of dogs is something she shares with Meghan.And on meeting her for the first time, the corgis gave Meghan their seal of approval. He explained pointing at Meghan: The corgis took to you straight away. For the last  years, I’ve been barked at, and this one walks in, absolutely nothing, just wagging tails. And Meghan added that the dogs were just laying on my feet during tea, it was very sweet. Christmas privilege  Another sign that the Queen had a sweet bond with Meghan was at Christmas in .In what appeared to be a break with tradition, the Queen gave Meghan the rare privilege of joining the royals for Christmas at Sandringham - even though she had not officially joined the family through marriage.That year, she was pictured with the royals walking to church for their annual Christmas Day service along with her now brother and sister-in-law the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. In contrast and despite being engaged to Prince William at Christmas , Kate had to wait until , once she had married, before being afforded an invitation to Sandringham. First outing  In June , just a month after her wedding, Meghan went on her first official trip with the Queen. They travelled overnight by royal train to Chester, where they spent the day at a number of engagements. Meghan later recalled what happened on that trip during her bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey. She said that after enjoying breakfast on the royal train with the Queen, Her Majesty gted her some beautul pearl earrings and a matching necklace. Meanwhile Meghan also said: We were in the car going between engagements. And she has a blanket that sits across her knees for warmth, and it was chilly. And she was like, aposMeghan, come on,apos and put it over my knees as well... And it made me think of my grandmother, where sheaposs always been warm and inviting and and really welcoming. Oprah fallout Following their move to the United States, in March this year, both Harry and Meghan sat down for a tell-all chat with Oprah Winfrey, where they made several claims against the royal family.Meghan alleged that there had been conversations about how dark son Archieaposs skin would be. She also shared that she had suffered from suicidal thoughts and claimed that she was denied help for her struggle. Following the airing of the chat, it prompted Buckingham Palace to issue a statement from the Queen saying she was saddened by the allegations, but added that some recollections may y. Lilibet tribute After the Oprah interview, the rt between Meghan and Harry and the rest of the royals seemed increasingly large. But when Meghan gave birth to a daughter in June, her name was a sweet tribute to the Queen. She was named Lilibet after an affectionate nickname given to the Queen by her grandfather George V, after she had trouble pronouncing Elizabeth as a child. The Mirror understands the Queen was “never asked” formallythe name could be used, but is supportive of the couple’s choice of name.UK    Since moving to the United States, Meghan has yet toto the UK to see the Queen, who no longer travels abroad due to her age. Her Majesty has not seen great-grandson Archie since  and is yet to meet Lilibet. It’s unclear when Harry and Meghan will bothto the UK with their children, with some tipping them to come to Britain for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee next year.And speaking in the Channel  documentary : The Queen’s Terrible Year, royal expert Camilla Tominey says it has been hard for the Queen to be so far away from her two great-grandchildren. She said: It is dficult for the Queen. She has not been able to see Archie.  I think the last time she was able to see Archie in the flesh was November . The only way the Queen will be able to see these children isthey come over to the UK. Maybe she will see them next year when she marks her Platinum Jubilee. We have to wait and see.Last week it was reported that the Queen waslooking forward to Christmasandher traditional family festive get togetherat her Norfolk estate of Sandringham. But one report has claimed Harry and Meghannot be coming to the UKto jointhe Queenfor her first Christmas without the latePrince Philip .The couple had reportedly been invited to join the rest of the royals at Sandringham for Christmas.But a source toldPage Six: “There’s a lot that goes into the logistics and the planning of the family Christmas, so of course, staff know that Harry and Meghan are not coming.“If they were, they would have communicated it to their family by now. “But this is Her Majesty’s first Christmas without her husband, so one would have hoped they would want to be with her.” The Sussexes have not commented on the claims.

Arthuraposs biological mum, who was jailed for  years earlier this year after fatally stabbing partner Gary Cunningham at her Harborne flat in February , paid tribute from her cell in a touching statement read by her own mother.Madeleine Halcrow read her daughteraposs poignant tribute, saying: Arthur was the light of my le. He wasnapost just my only child - he was my best friend.Never did I imagine he would be taken from this world so early in his le. If Arthur could ask for one last thing, it would be that he was remembered for his superpower. That will always be what I remember and Arthuraposs superpower was his smile. Talking about Arthuraposs loves would not be complete without mentioning superheroes, Marvel or DC. Arthur loved them all, from Batman to Black Panther, Aqua Man to the Flash. He had every costume and action figure and would spend hours dressing up and pretending he had all of their superpowers.  Labinjo-Halcrow said that, following the verdicts in the trial of Hughes and Tustin, she wanted to take the opportunity to focus on the le Arthur lived and to celebrate the beautul little boy I knew and loved deeply.Her touching tribute came after Tustin was jailed for le with a minimum of  years after being found guilty of murder and Hughes, guilty of manslaughter, jailed for  years. Twisted Tustin was pregnant with Hughesapos baby when she violently attacked Arthur in June , before undergoing an abortion at  weeks.During the trial at Coventry Crown Court, it has been revealed Tustin tried to avoid justice for her sickening attack on the little boy by taking an overdose and trying to hang herself.Mary Prior QC described her as a “high suicide risk”, saying that she had been “obliged to terminate a pregnancy .  Today, cowardly Tustin refused to leave her jail cell to take to the dock for sentencing. Horrying details in court described how Arthur was segregated for  hours a day and forced to sleep on the floor or in the hallway. Tragic footage also showed Arthur attempting to put away his own duvet in the dark after waking up on the floor. Other sickening evidence described how he was weakened by salt poisoned and deprived of food and water. He was found to have  injuries all over his body after being hit, slapped, kicked, punched, and beaten. Prosecutors said the pair kept Arthur isolated in the home, starved, dehydrated and routinely beaten. Tustin claimed Arthuraposs fatal head injury was self-inflicted, possibly by throwing himself down the staircase in her hallway, where he was forced to spend  to  hours a day, the court heard.  During his evidence, Hughes said Tustin mentally abused and gaslighted him into complying with the punishing disciplinary regime, but also admitted lying to school staff who were checking on Arthuraposs progress during the first Covid- lockdown. Tustin accused Hughes of being violent towards his son on multiple occasions and said he once threatened to throw the boy out of the window. Arthur was screaming and Tom shouted at him. He said apos you donapost shut your f****** mouth Iaposm going to throw you out the windowapos, she said. Arthur said aposno daddy not the windowapos. Tustinaposs barrister Mary Prior QC said: He was going to die and he was going to die because Thomas Hughes was in charge of Arthuraposs le and Arthuraposs le consisted of nothing other than misery. It emerged at trial that Arthur had been seen by social workers just two months before his death, after concerns were raised by his paternal grandmother Joanne Hughes, but they concluded there were no safeguarding concerns. In her victim impact statement, which she read in court ahead of the sentencing, Ms Hughes said Arthur, as a happy, contented, thriving seven-year-old would be alive today had her son not met Tustin. The secondary school teacher added: It is also clear that Arthur was failed by the very authorities that we, as a society, are led to believe are there to ensure the safety of everyone.  An independent review is now under way into the authoritiesapos contact with Arthur before his death. That work will include examining other potential missed opportunities to intervene, including an anonymous call Tustinaposs own stepfather John Dutton claimed in court to have made to social services, and contact with the police from Hughesapos brother about Arthuraposs bruises. The Independent Office of Police Conductis set to publish a report into West Midlands Policeaposs contact with the case, in due course, but has said it found no indication any inidual behaved in a manner that justied disciplinary proceedings. As the sentencing began Mr Justice Mark Wall QC said Tustin had been brought to court for her sentencing but had refused to come up to the dock. Instead he addressed his remarks to Hughes and Tustinaposs empty chair. It also emerged during the hearing how Tustin twice made attempts to take her own le during the trial which jurors were previously told had been periodically delayed for health reasons.  Mr Justice Wall started by saying the trial had been without doubt one of the most distressing and disturbing cases I have had to deal with, adding neither Hughes not Tustin had shown any remorse. The judge said Arthur had been, at the time Tustin was introduced into his le, a healthy, happy young boy. But less than three months after moving in with Tustin at the start of the first national lockdown, the little boy was left broken from exposure to a campaign of acute or prolonged abuse, he said. Tustin was also convicted of two counts of child cruelty, including salt-poisoning and withholding food and drink from Arthur. She had admitted two other cruelty counts, wilfully assaulting Arthur on three occasions and isolating him, including by forcing him to stand in the hallway for up to  hours a day as part of a draconian punishment regime.

The wooden floor was new when we moved in, but our old house had white tiles on the floor, so everything would wipe off. Iaposm gutted, I just didnapost think about the floor. I was using up the dregs of a snow spray can Iaposd been using on decorations and when it ran out I added the flour. She added: I was shouting, itaposs not coming off.

And it’s been redecorated  times, with a brand new theme. The mum-of-four said: “Usually my tree comes down in January. But these are unprecedented times, so this year I’ve kept the tree up   in our living room.” Vicki, , who lives in ­Langwith, Derbyshire, with husband Darren, , sons Niall, , -year-olds Dexter and Lennon and daughter Niamh, , told how the tree-athon began for an emotional reason.She added: “Last Christmas my brother Steven, , spent  days in hospital, including in ICU, with Covid and we couldn’t even visit him. I was worried, but ­thankfully he pulled through.“At first, I planned to keep the tree up until he was discharged and could visit, but then we went into lockdown so he wasn’t allowed to come here. “I decided to keep the tree to cheer us all up in January. But there always seemed to be another reason to redecorate it. A year on, here we are.” Will the tree remain up in   Vicki replies: “I haven’t decided yet. “My twin sons turn  next year and want a ‘birthday tree’ so I’ll do that. I won’t be surprisedI find a few more reasons to keep it up…” Here, Vicki takes us through her tree for all seasons… January  I put away the decorations, just keeping the lights on, and redecorated the tree with white and silver tinsel and stars which I borrowed from my mum.January felt so bleak and frightening, the country in lockdown and people dying of Covid, and I wanted our tree to be a light in the darkness.I found it soothing sitting by it, and it reminded me happier times would come again.February  I got the inspiration for this tree from Pinterest, where I saw lots of images of Valentine’s trees, which have become a new interior decor trend in recent years.I bought the decorations from a local pound shop, including heart lights and cardboard hearts, and it cost me less than a tenner. Although we’re not usually very romantic for Valentine’s, this year I wanted to spread some love in my home.March  Mother’s Day fell in March this year and to celebrate all the amazing mums out there who were working, home-schooling and caring for others during lockdown, as well as my own mum Mandy, , I created this special tree.The flowers in it are all articial and taken from a vase I had in the house. I spent a few pounds on the floral bunting and “Mum” balloon. Hung on the tree were little photos of my two grandmothers who have passed away.April  This was my second tree in the month of April, to mark my daughter Niamh’s th birthday.She couldn’t have a party because of Covid restrictions, but I still wanted to make the day special for her, so I created a “birthday tree”. She had no idea, I sent her away to my sister’s house for the night, so I could decorate it as a surprise and her face when she walked in the door was priceless. She absolutely loved it. Now all the kids want one for their birthdays.May  Of all the trees, this one is the most personal to me. In , I lost twin daughters called Daisy and Chloe  weeks into my pregnancy.I went on to have my twin sons Lennon and Dexter, now , but I’ve never forgotten my daughters and, after deciding to do a “spring” tree, I used a daisy theme to honour them. I used yellow streamers and glued paper daisies to them, which was time consuming, but it’s one of my favourite trees of the year. June  My husband and one of my sons are football mad, and the country was gripped by Euros fever, so I decided to do an England tree, to get behind the team.This one was very simple and inexpensive, with just aof flags and a few football helium balloons at the top. But it was fab having it there in the living room as we cheered on the England team all the way to the final.July, August and September I felt so happy this summer – the weather was great, and le felt a lot more normal again.I celebrated with a summer-themed tree, decorated with cardboard watermelon slices, flamingos, butterflies and huge tissue paper flowers, as well as rainbows as a reminder of all the key workers who worked so hard. The carers for my elderly neighbours love my trees and often park their car outside my house just to have a look and feel cheered up.October  It was time to get spooky in October and make a Halloween tree, something I knew the children in the local area would especially love.I made the tree look dark by draping black webbing over it and picked up most of the decorations for pennies in a local charity shop, plus stuff I had in the house from previous Halloweens. We had lots of trick-or-treaters call to the door, who were very impressed with it.November  Remembrance Sunday is an important day for us. My husband served in the Navy and both my brothers served in the Army.My mother and father-in-law died in September within  days of one another. They always went to the local march, and my mother-in-law used to carry the flag. I made all the poppies from tissue paper. It was very therapeutic, thinking about veterans and their sacrice.December  Christmas is just around the corner and my tree is back to its festive best, with a new Santa hat for the top and lots of lights and tinsel… all of which I had in the loft.I made the flowers and the holly berries myself. I’ve got really crafty in the past year. People have assumed I’ve spent a fortune, but I’ve actually only spent around £ since this time last year. After last Christmas, I can’t wait for the festive season to begin. It’s going to be so special to bring my family together for food, games and fun, and we can all enjoy my tree which has really helped me and my family through a hard year.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Christmas trees\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The concerned mum-of-two, Erin, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, lives with her five-year-old son and baby daughter in Hull.Their family house has been devoured in damp and mould, and she has been raising the issues with her landlord for almost two years, Hull Live reports.In January , she first notied Preston Road Womenaposs Centre, operating as Winner Trading Ltd, of the signicant issue in her home, but not date the matter remains unsolved. Erin has even had a number of visits from Hull City Councilaposs environmental health team who said thatthe repairs are not made, action may be taken by the council.  Speaking to Hull Live on her behalf, Erinaposs partner, Chris, whose name has also been changed, said: The house is absolutely covered in damp and mould, thataposs the worst thing about it. Itaposs in the bathroom, both bedrooms and the living room. Every single wall in the front, living room has it. Itaposs damaged furniture and even damaged a TV unit. My partner messages quite often and gets blanked.  According to Chris, the landlord has made no attempt to repair the problem, and two years, the family are frustrated and concerned. He said: What they told us to do was to wipe it down. But we have done that once and it just comes straight back. Erin hopes to move into a council property in order to escape the nightmare living conditions and to live with Chris, but so far, she has not had much luck in securing a property. The couple are anxious that being trapped in the property may have long-term health impacts on the two young children. Iaposve also been in contact with environmental health from Hull City Council, Chris added. Theyaposve visited twice already and are set to visit again this month. Chris said that environmental health last visited in November and had made recommendations to the landlords, Winner Trading Ltd, to take action on the issues with the property.  Preston Road Womenaposs Centre said: In line with the schedule of works issued by the local authority environmental health office, Winner Trading investigated the cause of the damp. Some remedial works have already been done at the property, we have identied there are further works required which will be implemented.A Hull City Council spokeswoman confirmed that members of environmental health had visited the property and said: The council inspected the property in July and identied a schedule of work required by the landlord, Winner Trading Ltd, to improvethe accommodation.A further visit recently showed that improvements were underway but a number of the scheduled items identied in the previous visit remained unaddressed, therefore a further visit has been arranged for later this month. If the work hasn’t been completed, the council will take appropriate formal enforcement action under the Housing Act .

The news comes as a new study boosted hopes vaccines offer a good level of protection against the mutated virus.The latest confirmed case was detected at Rosebank Primary School in Nairn, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Scotland to . A further  cases have also been confirmed in England, with an update on numbers expected to come later today. The UK government has already taken steps to combat the spread of the latest strain, with compulsory masks being re-introduced in shops and on public transport, and PCR tests for anyone arriving into the UK.  Worrying graphics have shown just how mutated the newly-emerged Omicron iant is, with illustrations released by the Genomics UK Consortiumshow that it has a worrying  mutations on its spike protein.By comparison Delta - which tore through the population last winter and has since become the worldaposs dominant strain - has seven. Experts have said Omicron, which was first identied by scientists in South Africa, is the most mutated Covid iant they have yet encountered. Yesterday a spokesman for the UK Health Security Agency told The Mirror that targeted testing is being carried out for the iant. This means that not every positive PCR test is screened for the new strain. In good news, experts behind a major new study have suggested booster vaccines offer good protection against the Omicron iant.  A team looking at the effects of third doses said the bodyaposs T cell immune response after a booster shot is such that it may provide protection from hospital admission and death. The study also says mRNA jabs, including Pfizer and Moderna, lead to the most signicant rise in immunity levels.Professor Saul Faust, trial lead and director of the NIHR Clinical Research Facility at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, said: All of the vaccines in our study do show a statistically signicant boost. RNAvery high, but very effective boosts from Novavax, Janssen and AstraZeneca as well. He said the CovBoost study had shown that six dferent vaccines are safe and effective as booster doses for people who have already had two doses of AstraZeneca or Pfizer BioNTech. The six vaccines tested as a third dose were AstraZeneca, Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Janssenand CureVac . He added that the vaccines worked well against existing iants, although Omicron was not tested in the study. But experts think that T cell immunity - which was studied alongside antibodies in the research - could also play a signicant role in fending off the new iant. T cells play a key role and work alongside antibodies in the immune system to target viruses. Prof Faust said: Even though we donapost properly understand its relation to long-term immunity, the T cell data is showing us that it does seem to be broader against all the iant strains. Which gives us hope that a iant strain of the virus might be able to be handled, certainly for hospitalisation and deathnot prevention of infection, by the current vaccines.

Her mum is determined that this Christmas will not be her little girls lastIslas mum is fighting for her daughter Image: MyLondon WSByAyokunle Oluwalana:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec A mum whose young daughter was given a devastating cancer diagnosis is in a race against time to save her le. Nicola Catonaposs daughter Isla is just seven years old and has been fighting the disease since she was two. Her family, from Stratford, East London, have been searching all over trying to find the right treatment and clinical trial which would help her, after a doctor gave her just three months to live. For mum Nicola, this has been five years of seeing her daughter battle the aggressive cancer and she is determined that this will not be her last Christmas.Before she was unwell, we used to call her aposbam bamapos. She was full of energy, Nicola told My London.She was a big, bouncy baby. Then, she was unwell for three months before she even got a diagnosis. Suddenly when Isla was just two, everything changed.  Nicola noticed that she was losing weight, had high temperatures and was always in pain and rubbing her legs. She took Isla to the hospital a number of times and said that AE said I was being over-sensitive about everything. Nicole knew something was wrong and insisted on Isla being checked out and eventually went to a private doctor. She said: When he examined her and saw how much weight she lost, he turned to me and said aposI think this is something seriousapos. They did an ultrasound. He told us it was cancer. I fainted. We never dreamed this would happen to our big, healthy baby.  Isla had been diagnosed with Neuroblastoma, a rare type of cancer that mostly affects babies or young children, and started treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital. It was there that Nicola met families with children going through a similar situation to Isla. When we first started fundraising, the other families told us that Neuroblastoma is extremely hard to cureyou relapse, she said. There is only a  per cent chance of survival at the beginning. As treatment began on Isla, the plan was to get her into remission and take her to America for a clinical trial. Nicola said: If we could get Isla into remission, there was a vaccine in America that would hopefully prevent the cancer relapsing. Sadly, Isla relapsed before she finished her frontline treatment, as doctors found a brain tumour, which was then removed. As the family tried to fundraise for another treatment in the US, Isla relapsed again. There were now several spots on her bones. She said: In July , our consultant basically looked at us and said. aposTake her home. Sheaposs got three months to liveapos. This news was heartbreaking for the family but Nicola could never give up hope for her little girl. She reached out to doctors worldwide about Neuroblastoma and spoke to parents going through the same turmoil. She said: The consultant called us and said Isla only has a two per cent chance of survival now.  I said, aposwhy canapost Isla be dferent aposItaposs this sheer determination that caused the family to fundraise to give Isla a better chance at le and hopefully find a cure.The family spent two years in Barcelona and the family were accessing trial after trial to try and get Isla back into remission. Things seemed to look up for her when she went into remission but in February , she relapsed again. Nicola said: In Spain, we spent around £, on medical bills. It was really hard, there were constant bills, paying for our house in the UK. Our only focus was on getting Isla back into remission. At the start of the pandemic in March , the family left Spain and moved back to London. This was a devastating blow to the family as they couldnapost go out and fundraise or access any treatment. We werenapost able to access any treatments, Nicola explained. We made a decision that after July that we wouldnapost be able to go back to Spain.Thankfully we found something on the NHS but unfortunately it didnapost work. Then on Christmas Eve, they told us itaposs not working.Since then itaposs just been chemotherapy to chemotherapy. Trying to hold the cancer at bay. Nicola feels sad for Isla. She doesnapost know any dferent and has missed out on a number of things just trying to live. Nicola said: She was miserable in Spain. She missed her sister. For the last five years, Iaposve focused on saving her le. We had to make a decision on whether we gave her a great le or tried to save it. At the beginning of , I vowed to give her the best le possible. Weaposd really like to make a lot of memories and let her enjoy everything. The plan for December is to have Father Christmas visit their home and spend quality time with the rest of the family. In the New Year, they want to be able to take her to CBeebies. Nicola added: The thing you miss most in the world is normality. Just being around family and having her home. A big part of Islaaposs battle is also to raise awareness for Neuroblastoma. Weaposre a working-class family and the people who have helped are just normal people, Nicola added. Itaposs really amazing.

The -year-old defendant is on trial at Winchester Crown Court accused of the murder of the millionaire hotelier and attempted murder of his mother, Anne Schreiber. The court was told that Schreiber called his sister, Louisa Schreiber, , while on remand at HMP Winchester awaiting trial. During the call, Schreiber told his sister: I am so sorry, absolute complete madness, I am waking up every day hoping to wake up from this nightmare. I had a complete loss of control, itaposs complete madness, it doesnapost make any sense and I am so sorry, I didnapost mean for any of this to happen, I didnapost want to hurt anyone and I have done the opposite. He added: I completely flipped, that wasnapost me that day, it wasnapost Tom Schreiber, it was someone , it was demons. Iaposm so sorry I did that to mum and Richard, itaposs so regrettable, everything is so regrettable, all I want to do is turn back the clock to April , it doesnapost seem real, I didnapost mean it, I just want to give mum a hug. The defendant also asked his sister in the call about his motheraposs condition, and she explained his kne attack had partially severed her spinal cord in her neck, leaving her paralysed and unable to breathe without a ventilator. Ms Schreiber suffered up to  separate injuries, including wounds to the back of her head, arm and chest, as well as to her neck, shoulder and back, in the attack. Ms Schreiber sobbed while the recording was played and the judge, Mr Justice Garnham, allowed her to compose herself before answering questions. The defendant, wearing a suit and tie, held his head down throughout the recording. Sir Richardaposs daughter, Caroline Sutton, who broke down in tears as she gave evidence behind a screen, said that her father had given each of the Schreiber siblings £, as deposits to buy a house, along with the monthly £, allowance. She said: My father was constantly talking about wanting him out of the house and he wouldnapost go. He constantly talked about Tom, about how Tom was rude and disrespectful and wouldnapost help him.

The concert took place on November  at the SSE Hydro, but as of yet, no cases have been linked to the concert that happened the following day. Scottish officials confirmed that there had been  new cases of the iant recorded in the past  hours, taking the overall number to . It was confirmed by Nicola Sturgeon, Scotlandaposs First Minister, that the Steps concert, as well as some other sources, are linked to the rise in Omicron cases. Leaders have said that while the risk to those who were at the show is low, they were working to get in touch with anyone who may have come into contact with the strain of the virus.  No one from the concert needs to isolate unless they are contacted to do so. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotlandaposs First Minister said: “The number of Omicron cases now being reported in Scotland is rising, and cases are no longer all linked to a single event, but to several dferent sources including a Steps concert at the Hydro on November . “This confirms our view that there is now community transmission of this iant within Scotland. Given the nature of transmission we would expect to see cases rise – perhaps signicantly – in the days ahead.  “However, health protection teams are continuing work through contact tracing, isolation and testing to slow the spread as far as possible while we learn more about the new iant’s impact. Ministers are also keeping the situation under daily review.” Cases of the new iant have been recorded in Highland, Grampian and Forth Valley health boards for the first time, at three, one and five respectively. Previously, nine cases of Omicron were linked to single private event a few weeks ago on November .

He had raised £, for Make-A-Wish UK and liked their work so much he began volunteering for them.Four years later, the dad of two was on the set of Coronation Street with his young daughter Hannah as she was granted a wish by the charity after being diagnosed with cancer.“After seeing the whole process from the inside and helping families through the most heartbreaking moments of their lives, suddenly the roles were reversed,” says Simon. “I found myself on the other side, turning to Make-A-Wish for something that could bring comfort and joy to my own sick child. “When we found out how ill Hannah was, our world fell apart.” He was an environmental health officer with the RAF in  when -year-old Hannah was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive soft tissue cancer. It was already stage four.  Simon, , says: “By this point I’d volunteered with Make-A-Wish for three years and I’d always been in awe of how families I met dealt with what they were facing. I’d felt huge empathy for them, but I never pictured myself going through it.” Hannah had a six-month course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Simon says: “She lost all her hair and parts of that time felt horric. “But Hannah was brilliant. However horrible it got, she kept on smiling. She was inspirational.” Afterwards, things seemed hopeful. She continued with maintenance chemo and, as her strength built up and her hair started to grow back, Simon and we Donna, , had more reason to be positive. They then decided to reach out to Make-A-Wish UK, this year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal charity. Simon, of Sleaford, Lincs, says: “I’d seen how having a wish granted could give families a real lt.” Hannah, then , asked the charity to arrange a Corrie visit for her and her family. Simon says the treat in November  was “wonderful”. He adds: “Make-A-Wish arranged a trip to Manchester over a couple of days. We were picked up in a limo from our hotel and taken to Granada Studios. “Hannah loved it. I remember we were greeted by Kate Ford, who plays Tracy Barlow, and she was lovely to us all. “Hannah loved walking around the set and seeing the cast. She got lots of autographs and loved meeting David Neilson, who plays Roy Cropper.”  Hannah and her older brother Callum even had a stint as extras. Simon says: “She could feel normal for a day. She could forget about hospitals and scans and chemo and have a fun day with her family where none of that mattered.” Then, just after Christmas in , Hannah noticed a lump in her neck and was taken back to hospital. It was on the day her appearance on Corrie was broadcast in January  that doctors gave the family the news that she had relapsed. “Still we hoped for a miracle,” says Simon, who will share her story at tonight’s Make-A-Wish Ball in London. She had more chemo but by September doctors said there was nothing more they could do. “We took her home from hospital and had her there for six days before we lost her on September , ,” Simon says. He adds his involvement with the charity gave him – as well as his we and son Callum, now  – a reason to stay positive.  Simon says: “Everyone is dferent in how they grieve, but for me carrying on with Make-A-Wish helped.” The year after Hannah’s death, Simon set about an amazing challenge in her honour. “She was  when we lost her,” he says. “So I decided to do  half marathons. I raised money for a number of charities, including Make-A-Wish. “I had a sign with me with a picture of Hannah. Every time I was struggling I remembered all she had been through and it helped me keep going.” He still volunteers with the charity and says of the granted wish: “We’ll never forget the joy it brought her.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON David NeilsonKate FordCoronation StreetHospitalsSoap operasCancerMirror Christmas appeal\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Dont miss out on the biggest soaps gossip!

Scientists are racing to work outthe new iant, first discovered in southern Africa, spreads faster, circumvents vaccines or causes worse side affects.Experts say people are presenting cold-like symptoms since receiving the vaccine and according to the ZOE Covid symptom study app, people who test positive most commonly report a headache, runny nose, sore throat and sneezing. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, said the main symptoms of Cmicron to look out for are:Fatigue Body aches Headache She described one “very interesting case” of a six-year-old girl who had “a temperature and a very high pulse rate, The Sun reports. A World Health Organizationofficial has told the Reuters news agency that most people are not getting seriously ill, although it could still be the case.  Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, a top WHO adviser, said: “In terms of the severity profile, we have seen reports of cases with Omicron that go from mild disease all the way to severe disease. “There is some indication that some of the patients are presenting with mild disease, but again it is early days. We do have a surveillance bias right now in terms of the cases that are being detected.  “There is also a suggestion of increased hospitalisations across South Africa, but that could be the sheer fact that we have more cases. “If you have more cases you will have more hospitalisations.” Meanwhile, a health director in Botswana said  out of  people infected had no symptoms, while the other three had “very, very mild” illness. It comes as nine more cases of the Omicron iant were discovered in England taking the total across the country to .Cases have now been identied in the East Midlands, East of England, London, South East and North West.

Last year there were special gongs given out for the best takeaways and family teams operating during the pandemic. But this year, we want to know the answer to a burning question overlooked by the Curry Oscars: where can we find the hottest curry in the UK   Many restaurants have made the audacious claim over the years, from eateries in Edinburgh right down to luxury establishments in London. The hottest type of curry generally available across Britain is the fearsome Phaal, a dish even hotter than vindaloo. But some sadistic chefs have made it their mission to go even further, cooking up something so hot that just eating it - let alone enjoying it - is a challenge. We set out to try some of the spiciest curries around the country to see which was the hottest – so you don’t have to.Crocodile Inferno, The Dilshad, Cannock, Staffordshire By Dan Hall What happened to me at The Dilshad in Cannock, Staff., was profound and humbling.The restaurant is home to the notorious Crocodile Inferno - a curry so diabolically hot that diners have to sign a disclaimer acknowledging what theyaposre letting themselves in for before buying it. As the name suggests, the dish is made with crocodile meat because, as restaurant ownerTony Uddin explains, it absorbs more of the spice.  There are over  chillies included in the £ dish, including some of the most formidable on the planet. Tony says: “Some of the hottest are the Trinidad scorpion - which is very competitive. “And we also use fresh Naga which is also just ridiculously hot.” You have to give the restaurant two daysapos noticeyou want a Crocodile Inferno because it takes that long to assemble the full bestiary of ingredients.  Aside from the disclaimer, there are a couple of other chilling insights into what Iaposm about to eat before the curry even arrives at the table.One is that Tony insists I sit in an area away from other diners in case the fumes from my dish are too strong for customers sitting at another table .And the other is that the chef preparing my meal wears a gas mask for his own protection while handling the weapons-grade spice. The portents of doom continue when the waiter brings the curry to my table.  Before he even takes the lid off the dish, the spice is so pungent that my eyes start to water. But even with all of these red flags, nothing could prepare me for whataposs about to happen when I take my first taste. As soon as the sauce touches my lips, the burning sensation is instantaneous and incredible, roughly akin to what I imagine it would be like to be flamethrowered in the face. When the heat reaches my throat, I feel like Iaposm swallowing a chainsaw, and I start to hyperventilate as Iaposm consumed with agony.  For some sick reason I decide to persevere with the ordeal, hoping I might adjust to the Saturn V rocket launching on my tongue. But I donapost - it just keeps getting worse the more mouthfuls I have, with the searing pain intensying until my vision blurs and my hands start to tingle. Iaposm knocking back beer to try and take the temperature down, but it doesnapost help - I wouldaposve happily necked a pint of liquid nitrogen had there been one to hand. After about  minutes of heaving in a truly undignied manner and with the harrowing prospect of tomorrow morning in mind, I decide to throw in the towel.

For those who really hate their own nervous system, Tony tells me heaposs currently working on an even spicier version of the Inferno to be launched next year which will use shark meat. To anyone interested, I promise you the crocodile is deadly enough.Prawn Rogan Josh, MyLahore, Bradford, West Yorkshire By Laura Connor I head to UK curry capital Bradford to sample one of their hottest curries at one of the city’s flagship Indian restaurants, MyLahore.I don’t mind reasonably spicy food and normally enjoy a tomato-based Rogan Josh as long as I can specy it comes with medium heat. But I can barely get through a mouthful of their hottest prawn version, even when it’s absorbed by mounds of pilau rice and washed down with an entire jug of lemon water.  At least I’ve definitely drank today’s daily recommended eight glasses of water in just one sitting. This recipe is made with seven bullet chillies - which rack up ,-, heat units on the Scoville scale , used to measure chilli spice levels - mixed with classic Madras spices, including eye-watering amounts of cayenne pepper and mustard powder. I take a deep breath before trying the scarlet-red curry, with visible bright green chillies menacingly winking at me from the sauce. My waiter kindly brings over some yogurt and mint dip to help cool my mouth down - before askingI would like to try their newest menu addition: spicy chicken wings.  I try one and my mouth feels like an angry volcano so I politely ask for some Tupperware to take them home in. Hopefully my mouth will have cooled down by lunchtime tomorrow…City Spice Challenge, City Spice, Brick Lane, London By Dan HallThereaposs no single street in Britain more synonymous with curries than Londonaposs Brick Lane. The legendary road was once home to  curry houses in the mid-s, with over a dozen still going today.One of the best of them is City Spice, which has been referred to as the “King of Brick Lane” thanks to its endless accolades - which have included the Masterchef curry award  for best restaurant in London. As well as delicious delicacies, the Indian eatery is home to the City Spice Challenge. Manager Reez Haque, , says the restaurant wanted to cook up a punishingly hot dish that could put even the most ardent spice lovers through their paces. The £. meal is a bhuna from hell, souped-up with some of the hottest chillies known to science. One is the dreaded Carolina Reaper, the Guinness World Record holder for hottest chilli which clocks in at a shuddersome . million SHU.  For context, the pepper spray police use to incapacitate people is about  million SHU. Reez says: “The reason we started the challenge was to do something for the local community. “The idea was thata diner could finish it off, whatever they pay for the dish would go to charity. “Instead of putting the chillies directly into the dish, we blend them and get the juice out.  “The benefit of doing that is that it doesn’t kill the flavour of the other ingredients.” After the first mouthful, I feel pretty cocky that Iaposll be able to get through the City Spice Challenge without breaking a sweat. But the hubris doesn’t last long. As with a thermonuclear blast in the distance, the heat doesnapost hit you right away - you just get a flash of it on the first bite foretelling the fire to come.  The heat builds and builds until my mouth is a furnace, but Iaposm just about able to keep my cool. And perversely, by the time I finish, I actually quite enjoyed it. Butyouaposre going out for dinner, there must be something seriously wrong with youthis is the level of heat that you actually want - evenit is for a good cause!Circle of Fire, The Crooked Skewer, Hull, East Yorkshire By Greg FordWe were warned. Crooked Skewer owner Aminul Choudhury sits calmly by the table as he outlines the reduction process he has perfected to produce what he believes is one of the hottest curries in the county. In truth ‘The Circle of Fire’ is a beast born from a touch of madness kg of chillies including Ghost Pepper, Scorpion Pepper and Carolina Reaper dried and made into a paste.  The curry is then reduced over several days until it barely fills a bowl, with nothing added except water, because Aminul says he doesn’t want to risk losing heat. The grill house beef is seared and thinly sliced before being glazed in a nine million SHU sauce named ‘Hell Unleashed’. Aminul estimates the heat of the dish at five million SHU, and after tasting it I’m not in a mood to disagree with him.  The spice is present on the first bite, searing on the second and unbearable by the third. Flashes of flavour are replaced with a pure and painful heat, numb lips and an insatiable appetite for mango lassi. Fellow diners bravely accepting the tempting offer of a freebie instantly regret their choice.  One woman runs for the bathroom while a man showing off on a date makes a fool of himself by crying. Genuinely the hottest dish to pass my lips and I hope for my body’s sake it stays that way.

Giving evidence in Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex abuse and grooming trial in New York, Juan Alessi was quizzed about the visitors to the billionaire’s Palm Beach home in Florida. The British socialite’s defence lawyer, Jeffrey Pagliuca askeda number of foreign people visited the house. Mr Alessi, , agreed saying: English accents. French accents. Italian accents. The attorney asked: “Lots of dferent accents ” to which Mr Alessi said yes. Already the trial has been told of at least three Brits who surrounded paedophile Epstein including Prince Andrew and a woman known as ‘Emmy’ who was Maxwell’s personal assistant.  Earlier Mr Alessi testied that he drove two girls who he believed appeared underage to the late financieraposs Palm Beach estate. The former butler, who worked full-time for Epstein from  to , said he saw the two girls spend time with Epstein and Maxwell at the property, where he recalled cleaning sex toys from Epsteinaposs massage room and storing them in Maxwellaposs bathroom. Mr Pagliuca also questioned Mr Alessi about his admission to stealing money from Epstein, which he admitted, calling it the biggest mistake of his le. During yesterday’sevidence the attorney was admonished by trial judge Alison Nathan after he repeatedly called an alleged victim of Maxwellaposs by her real name and not the pseudonym ‘Jane’ which has been used.  The Brit, , has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other crimes, including two perjury charges that will be tried at a later date. Prosecutors accuse Maxwell of recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse, and say she participated in some of the encounters. Her attorneys argue she is being scapegoated for his alleged crimes since the globetrotting investor is no longer alive. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in  at the age of  while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges. Alessiaposs account came after testimony earlier this week from one of the girls he said he saw at Epsteinaposs estate. The woman now in her early s testying under the pseudonym Jane who said Maxwell set her up for abuse by Epstein while she was ,  and  in the mid-s. Jane is the first of four Maxwell accusers expected to testy in the trial.  Maxwellaposs attorneys questioned Jane about discrepancies between her testimony and earlier statements she made during interviews with law enforcement agents, and have said the womenaposs memories have become distorted over time. The defendant is further alleged to have lied under oath by hiding her participation in Epsteinaposs offences during a separate civil case. Maxwell, who has been held in a US jail since her arrest in July last year, denies all charges. If convicted she faces up to  years in prison.

The ride was a theatre-like experience, which took place across three areas.According to the Sun, the story began with an alien corporation called XS-Tech, which showcased its brand new teleportation technology to the audience.Following this, a robot demonstrated the teleportation device by moving a small alien across the room. Next up, while guests were trapped, strapped to their seats, the teleportation technology supposedly went wrong.  A huge carnivorous alien with wings emerged from the tube and the lights in the room went out. Audience members would then feel the “breath” of the alien on the back of their necks. In another twist, they could feel the alien’s “drool” dripping from its mouth. The ride was plagued with controversy from the get go, with guests regularly complaining it was too scary and not in keeping with the rest of the theme park’s rides.  Guests would reportedly scream so much during the experience that they would miss important dialogue and plot points, making it impossible to understand what was going on. Others werenapost happy with the violence and the confusing plotline, while there were also negative reviews about the comedic tone of the pre-show, in comparison to the sinister tone of the actual attraction.  Furthermore, children under the age of  were encouraged not to visit, prompting complaints from their parents. In response to these complaints, Disney halted the original version of the ride and spent several months and an extra millionon improvements. But upon reopening, the park continued tor receive complaints from parents and other guests about how scary the attraction was.  Paired with budget issues, these complaints led to the eventual cancellation of the ride. In , the attraction was shut down and replaced with a new, lighter attraction, based on Lilo  Stitch. The closure also put a halt to the ride being potentially added to the Paris and Tokyo Disneylands.  Previous guests have since taken to Reddit to share how they were left scarred by the ride. One person wrote: I was so little when I went on this and I swear it was the scariest ride Iaposve ever been on. I was TERRIFIED to go on Stitch because of still being scared of the alien version. Another person said their dad had to carry them off the ride “sobbing” when they were a child. All I remember is having my eyes closed with my head in my momaposs lap sobbing the entire time,” another former guest added. “I still have nightmares about that ride.

When I refused, she smashed a glass on the ground and said, this is why celebrities dont come here Image: Katherine DinsdaleopinionByKatherine Dinsdale:,  Dec | comments“Get paid to party” – scroll through the bartender jobs section of Indeed and this will come up on your feed. Sounds ideal right  Except at that party, you’re the designated driver. Instead of pouring yourself drinks, people keep taking them off you. For all the pub lovers and club fanatics, I’m going to be giving you a glimpse into the world of bartending. So, grab your trusty pink spray and blue roll, and let’s travel to the other side of the suspiciously sticky bar. They say you can’t judge a book by its cover, but that’s part of the job. When someone with a bleach bob haircut and suit jacket asks for a glass of your finest prosecco – you know it’s time to run. It’s not that we care about what you drink, but certain orders do tend to trigger our fight or flight response. And for good reason. A self-described “TikTok influencer” once came into a bar I worked at and demanded I served her a free cocktail pitcher. When I refused, she smashed a glass on the ground and said, “this is why celebrities don’t come here”. I’m sure bar popularity took a real hit from not being featured on her k follower TikTok account. But it can’t all be mixing with the stars. Ordinary people can also be a nightmare when you supply them with enough booze. Once a man downed a pint of Guinness in front of me, looked me straight in the eyes and said: “Where’s my drink  I want to speak to the manager.” I know alcohol is meant to cause memory loss, but surely not to that degree.  And for those of you who decide to order one of each cocktail on the menu five minutes before close – there’s a special place in bar hell for you. But anyone in the industry will tell you that all of this is preferable to the dreaded end of the night toilet checks. Bar toilets are absolute anarchy – especially in the hygiene department.  Take it from me, the woman who once had to witness someone fish a pink wig out of a used toilet on Halloween, and then kindly put it back on her friend’s head. And let’s not forget the time I found a poo-filled bottle of Corona stuck in the women’s toilets. Yes, I’m shaming you. After witnessing the absolute worst of drunkards, you’d think at closing time the last thing we’d want to think about would be alcohol. But after cling-filming every bottle of wine in the building, a pint at  in the morning seems more inviting than you might think. Plus, itaposs free - one of the perks of working at a bar I must admit. So next time you have a particularly wild night out and wake up with that dreaded hangover anxiety, just know your mates aren’t the only ones who have embarrassing stories about you. But we’ll forgive you,you promise to not pay with both cash and card next time you come in.

What do you think about Toriaposs prank  Let us know in the comments...Tori, from US, said she borrowed the idea from the naughty Elf on the Shelf and came up with a prank when her three-year-old girl was misbehaving. Admitting that they are a Christmas after Halloween family, Tori showed her parenting trick on TikTok and said: Our daughter was an absolute s*** today. Elfie is going to have a little surprise for her when she wakes up. She heads outside the home and picks a pebble from the front garden, painting it black so that it looks like a small piece of coal. Tori then places the coal in a red gt box and hides the Elf doll before including a note that writes: To: DJ For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. In a follow-up video, Tori shows her daughteraposs reaction as she reads out the note: Reindeer DJ, I had to go back to the North Pole to tell Santa how mean you have been. I am sad! Please be good so Santa will bring you lots of presents, see you soon. Love, Elfie. When the girl finds a dirty rock in the box, her dad says: Yeah, bad kid gets coal. Many parents disagreed with Toriaposs idea and said she ruined the Christmas spirit. One wrote: Now it lost its magic because you touched it. A second penned: Great, sheaposs traumatised now. Tori hit back at the mean comments and said: My daughter thought it was hilarious. Iaposm sorry for anyone who took this to heart or had a bad experience with their parents. My baby is loved unconditionally and she knows it.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

This startling piece of information comes courtesy of YouTuberTom Scott, who revealed in a recent video that many chippies instead use something known as a non-brewed condiment in place of vinegar. Youaposve probably never been able to tell the dference between the two, as it looks very similar to the real thing and only tastes slightly dferent. A non-brewed condiment is a malt vinegar substitute made from water, acetic acid and ious flavourings - yummy! It takes less time to make than actual vinegar and can be purchased in concentrated form.  It also possesses several other benefits that the real stuff doesnapost have. For example, it doesnapost contain any alcohol, making it halal and a great choice for teetotal customers. Some batches of the condiment are also gluten-free, meaning businesses can cater to a wider range of people with it. But the real question is, will discovering this industry apossecretapos put you off using the aposvinegarapos in fish and chip shops in the future  Let us know in the comments below.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

leaders and title favourites Arthurlie on Saturday November .Star stung the hosts at Cowan Park, Barrhead, with an excellent start to the match, forcing a succession of corners before the ever-dangerous Coll McCallum finished after an excellent delivery by Craig Aitken.The visitors doubled their lead after  minutes when Craig Aitken broke clear down the left and finished with an excellent effort into the goalkeeper’s far corner to put Star - ahead.Star were under pressure for much of the remainder of the half but always carried a threat on the break, with Stuart MacLean’s pace causing the home side no end of problems.Into the second half, Arthurlie forced their way back into the match and pulled a goal back after a rare defensive lapse by Star on  minutes. Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

It is not #green# to have to do a -mile car journey for essentials.#The Co-op also seems to be replacing many branded items with their own products which are nowhere near as good.#He believes this policy is #pricing out rural living#, and continued: #It is particularly hard-hitting for those less mobile, non-car owners and the elderly.#Come on Co-op, a change needs to happen.#His post attracted a big response # with people in other parts of Argyll and Bute supporting his views.Mr Bates has since written directly to the Co-op, but emphasised: #The excellent hard-working management and staff at the Co-op in Tarbert are a big part of our community and are very helpful and kind. They have no control over pricing and stocking policy, which is decided by the board.#Stressing that the supermarket operates a UK pricing policy, a Co-op spokesperson said: #Co-op is committed to serving and supporting its rural communities, conveniently, including areas where other retailers often do not trade due to the increased operational costs.#Like all retailers, Co-op has experienced some patchy disruption to the availability of some products, and it is working with suppliers to re-stock as quickly as possible.#Alongside well-known brands, Co-op#s award-winning own-brand products provide shoppers with choice # delivering quality and value, while also enabling customers and community causes to unlock additional value and benefits through its membership programme.#Mr Bates added: #The Co-op bosses in Manchester need to realise that the Tarbert Co-op and others in rural locations are not convenience stores. These are often the only store for miles and are therefore leline stores.#If they do not understand this, then they do not understand the communities they are serving.#Speaking on Wednesday this week, Mr Bates said he had received no reply from Co-op management.He said ##apart from an automated receipt reply, I have heard nothing further.

extra hour in their daily commute to Edinburgh using the  bus service, which stops at Prestonpans, Wallyford, Musselburgh and Portobello.An online petition launched by Mr Hoy calling for the

continued withdrawal of the service, including challenges with recruitment, the need to prioritise key services and the focus on delivering the  service.ldquoI recognise these challenges, but I also recognise they apply across all routes across the whole of the Lothians and are not confined to the X route.ldquoAfter a number of residents living in Dirleton, Gullane, Aberlady and Longniddry

this up with a third letter to the interim managing director of Lothian Buses.ldquoLothian Buses is owned by the four Lothian council areas, which includes East Lothian Council.

I cant see the situation dramatically changing in the next couple of weeks - we have to watch this space...thats genuinely where we are scientically right now.\": Latest Omicron casein Scotland not connected to othersA total of  cases of the Omicron iant have been confirmed in Scotland so far,including at leastnine which are linked and have been traced back to a single private event held on November .It is unclear whether the three confirmedtoday- two in NHS Lanarkshire and one in the Greater Glasgow area- are linked to this event or separate.One caseidentied in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde region, confirmed on Wednesday, was not linked to that event.The Omicron iant was first detected in Botswana in November and appears to be driving a rapid surge in Covid infections in South Africa, with signs that it is overtaking Delta as the dominant strain.There are concerns that its high number of mutations - including  on the spike protein used by the virus to infect cells - could make it more resistant to current vaccines and immunity.There are signs from Public Health Scotland data that the recent fall in Covid cases stopped on November  with a very small increase in positive cases by November If protection against infection is reduced, however, scientists remain confident that vaccines would still provide a strong defence against serious illness or death - as has already been seen following the emergence of the Delta strain.Prof Bauld said: \"I think we should be worried about Omicron because it really, genuinely does look more transmissible.\"We dont know about disease severity or immune escape from the vaccines, but we have confidence that eventhe vaccines are weakened in terms of transmission and infection that they will still work in terms of saving peoples lives basically. Even these current vaccines that we have.\"So I am worried, but Im not saying that these vaccines are useless - theyre still working and will still work, evennot as well, against Omicron.\": Abnormal spike in neonatal deaths not linked to Covid in mothers orbabiesProf Bauld told podcast listeners that it was \"absolutely imminent\" that boosters will be added to Scotlands vaccine passport apps, allowing people travelling abroad to show that they have had a third jag.Some countries are now requesting proof of boosters for entry as part of border controls, or for access into leisure and hospitality venues.However, Prof Bauld said she was not in favour of tougher rules on arrivals into the UK.The Scottish Government has asked Westminster to consider extending home self-isolation to eight days for travellers arriving from non-red list countries, with people only able to end self-isolationthey test negative for Covid on a PCR test taken on day eight.Currently, all arrivals have to take a PCR test within two days of entering the UK and remain in isolation until they receive a negative result.Prof Bauld said this was \"proportionate\".She added: \"Im really hopeful that we dont go in that direction [eight-day self-isolation] unless we absolutely have to.\"The main reason for that is that when you see domestic spread of this iant, then thinking about travel as the main source becomes less of an issue.\"Its too early to tellthat would occur - governments arent ruling it out - but its not the plan at the moment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snp-shouldnt-get-excited-one-rogue-poll","story":"Nicola Sturgeon is caught between a rock and a hard place and how she handles this is critical.

Now it is experiencing the real dilemmas such behaviour creates for those in authority.Indyref is still in the melting pot and the manold crises in the NHS are not going away, to say nothing of all the other pressing problems in her in-tray. Ms Sturgeon has ridden her luck for many years now. Is it about to run out Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.* JOHN Dunloplikes to submit short acerbic letters to The Herald, usually with an anti-Scottish independence slant. Perhaps he was a bit premature with his latest effort, given the result of the recent Ipsos-Mori poll showing support for Scottish independence at %. Could it be that the electorate of Scotland really do want to catch up with the rest of the modern world, including Barbados Alec Oattes, Ayr.PARTYS OVER FOR JOHNSONCOME on over to his place,Come on, hes having a party.With loads of booze and plenty of nibbles,Boris is having a party tonight.How very galling, how very Downing Street one rule for us and another for those behind the black door. While we all wearily faced another lockdown last Christmas, after a frightening year, and with the prospect of spending a dismal festive season cut off from family and friends, No  staff were merrily rocking round the clock . Whether he was present or not, the party took place within the Prime Ministers official home and on his watch.Given all of Mr Johnsons gaffes since he took office, perhaps we shouldnt really be surprised at this one, but somehow this latest example of cynical insensitivity and lack of solidarity with the rest of the population really sticks in the craw. Mr Johnson declares that all Covid guidelines were followed, but seems unable to grasp that holding the party at all was a breach of his own rules.The partys over for Mr Johnson it will take him a long time to clear up the mess.Ruth Marr, Stirling.WHATS GREAT ABOUT THE CENTRE MARK Smith claims he identies with Sir Keir Starmer because the Labour leader is \"attempting to steer the Labour Party back to the \"centre\" .Perhaps he could elaborate and tell us the last time the Labour Party was in the \"centre\". The last Labour government which I voted for in  will, in my opinion, forever be associated with the following: its kow-towing to the Bush White House and the oil billionaires which determined its policy its sycophancy towards media moguls and policies which allowed the City of London to run rampant. The upshot of course was the biggest financial collapse in the countrys history and one of the biggest foreign policy disasters in the countrys history.Is this Mr Smiths centre Many people I feel will still be in the dark about what Sir Keir stands for perhaps he has let Mr Smith in on his secret. It is worth remembering that the most effective British politician of the th century did not eschew \"radical and damaging ideologies\". This is what made Mrs Thatcher, loathe her or love her, such a towering figure.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.TOO LATE TO THE PROBLEMSTHE debate in Holyrood on Wednesday on the cases of hospital-acquired infections was enlightening. The main argument from SNP politicians was that they had carried out reviews and acted on the recommendations.Just as with the impact of Storm Arwen, the SNP is always chasing its tail trying to fight fires rather than stopping them starting in the first place.Jane Lax, Aberlour.FOLLOW SWEDEN ON MP STANDARDSANDY Macivers article suggesting paying politicians more to get better service was astonishing. For the last few decades we have heard endless justications for the absurdly-high salaries paid to executives . That has not prevented financial disasters, business failures, scandals and revelations of incompetence and corruption.Mr Maciver should perhaps study the government of Sweden, where politicians do not have official cars and drivers or other privileges. They cannot vote themselves extra money for constituency travel. They live in state-owned apartments in Stockholm but do not get allowances for homes or second homes. They have no way of claiming for duck ponds or moat cleaning.Their tax s are publicly available like most other information.In  the deputy prime minister was sacked because she made a small purchase using a government credit card, despite having already refunded the money.If our politicians received salaries comparable with those paid in Sweden and worked under similar conditions, our government would be more credible. But perhaps Mr Maciver thinks that the UK is already much better managed than Sweden Peter M Dryburgh, Edinburgh.START TREATING US AS ADULTSWHILE there can be little doubt that the new Omicron iant of Covid is cause for concern, it is interesting that we are being given very little information about the state of health of the very few people who are unfortunate enough to have contracted it. Are they seriously ill  Hospitalised  Or only mildly affected We donrsquot actually know, because it would appear that governments across the UK keep this information secret in the belief that giving this information to the public would affect their attitudes towards taking precautions. The general assumption is that we canrsquot be trusted to do the right thing to prevent transmission. Well, after nearly two years of bad decisions by our leaders during which, in general, we have followed their guidance, it may be time to treat us more like adults than children.At the start of the pandemic, most of our leaders stated that there would be an open and honest consultation with the public about measures to control the spread of the disease. It didnrsquot happen then, it hasnrsquot happened since, and it isnrsquot happening now.Dave Henderson, Glasgow.FM HAS AGAIN FAILED TO ACTTEN days after Omicron was detected in Scotland the First Minister has failed to act yet again. Unlike Austria she hasnt made the vaccine compulsory, or made it compulsory for NHS or care workers like in England.Nor has she introduced eight-day isolation for people flying into Scotland despite calling for the UK Government to do it in England.She hasnt led by example by making Holyrood Parliament online again, nor has she banned hospital visits, or shutdown or curfewed pubs and nightclubs like many European countries. In other words, once again she has done nothing but try to sht the blame where. As we head towards , Covid deaths in Scotland by the end of this winter, Nicola Sturgeon should be ashamed.David Watson, Edinburgh.IN THE LINE OF FIREJILL Stephensons letterdisplays a curious lack of knowledge, as her reference to investigations would suggest she has never heard of the presumption of innocence. In her eyes it is quite okay to lambast the SNP over its actions, but not so in relation to Mr Johnsons party. I rarely write about politics, but her letter is nothing to do with politics it is about plumbing the depths of shallowness.I much prefer to write on other matters, such as the recent discussion on the elusiveness of snipe and woodcock. It brought to mind my late fathers account of a shoot in Aberdeenshire. The keeper drew up a line of shooters to walk along the face of a gentle slope, placing the men in descending order of quality, with the best shots at the higher end. Almost at once a snipe arose at the top and flew down the entireof the line, with every man firing at least one shot at it until it reached the last in the line, who downed it. The keeper walked over to pick up the bird and, on holding it aloft, declared: \"Thatll teach ye tae flee stracht.\" We should be glad such a bird exists as otherwise, Army marksmen might have ended up being called woodcockers.George F Campbell, Glasgow.Read more: I can reassure the doubters: vaccines are safer than you are being led to believe"},{"url":null,"title":"sophie-raworth-replace-andrew-marr-bbcs-sunday-morning-show-interim-presenter","story":"The news follows Marrrsquos recent announcement that he is leaving the BBC after more than two decades.The BBC said in a statement that Raworth will front the popular show for a ldquoshort period while a recruitment process for a permanent presenter takes place.Once a permanent appointment is made, the programme will relaunch with a new presenter, title and a new look, the BBC said.Marrrsquos last show will air on December ."},{"url":null,"title":"part-3-go-behind-scenes-bearsden-choir-prepare-christmas","story":"The -strong groupwill perform in Kingsborough Sanctuary on Hyndland Road in Glasgow.

The forecasting ides the road network into inidual routes rather than geographic areas making it easier for decision makers to direct resources where they are needed most.#Each island is designated as a route, while the Mainland is ided into eight routes. Up until this year, the decision on how, and when, to treat the road network in the winter months has relied upon the information received from two weather stations at the Mill of Rango in Sandwick and at Kirkwall Airport, basically covering the East and West, while this has been helpful, it was a very broad brush.“The system is being closely monitored by officers throughout the winter season with view to summarise its performance at the conclusion of the trial next year. This will determinewe want to adopt this technology on a permanent basis.”Stressing that road safety remains the top priority, she said:“I want to reassure our communities thatwe are treating areas of the West Mainland, but not parts of the East for example, we are doing this because we are confident – based on the data – that the roads in the East do not require it.”There are km of priority one roads in Orkney, km of priority two routes and km of priority three roads.In line with nationally recommended guidance, the council’s Winter Service Policy - points out that the network will be treated in the morning when road surface temperatures are predicted to be below C, and in the afternoon when they are predicted to be below C.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Scottish Government via Transport Scotland have funded around half the £. million costs.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, is confident that the new m modern fibre glass vessel will have been worth the wait.“We are delighted to be able to announce the start date for the Nordic Sea. The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change. Over this parliament we will invest at least £ million through the fund, delivering real change that people and nature will benefit from across the whole country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney.

In the past, artists could go out and earn extra money through performing at live events. Not now, they couldnrsquot, and they would rely far more heavily on what was coming through from streaming.ldquoWhy should the taxpayer pick up the bill for these international giants who arenrsquot paying their contributors, creators, writers, correctly ldquoThat is wrong.A spokesperson for BPI, which represents record labels, said: ldquoDame Vera Lynn has received and continues to receive royalties for the success of Wersquoll Meet Again as well as all the recordings she made with Decca.ldquoIn fact, from  onwards and throughout her le, Decca and Dame Vera enjoyed a very close working relationship that continues to this day with her family and her estate.ldquoTogether, they have worked on a number of record breaking and chart topping releases.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Last night was the first night.”“I went down on Monday and there was no mention of it. You used to get a  per cent discount.”He added: “I was totally surprised. I only booked my ticket a week or so ago. I wasn’t advised, and it doesn’t seem astheir crew was advised – I did query it with them.”Serco NorthLink’s commercial director Jim Dow said: “We are proud to offer an extensive food and drink menu on board that is very reasonably priced and equal for all passengers.“Our commitment to working with local suppliers continues and we are proud to showcase those partnerships. “While the Islander discount code is no longer in place, all passengers do have access to a iety of choices and price points.”A classic example of where profits are more important than the service Serco gives. Despite it being a leline service, Serco obviously see#s this as an oppertunity to profit from this by penalising islanders regardless. I would suggest people take onboard a lunch box, which would probably be cheaper, on their next trip down south. ...Ryan Taylor has worked as a reporter since , and has been at The Shetland Times since , covering a wide iety of news topics.Before then he reported for other newspapers in the Highlands, where he was raised, and in Fe, where he began his career with DC Thomson. He also has experience in broadcast journalism with Grampian Television. He has lived in Shetland since , where he harbours an unhealthy interest in old cars and motorbikes.NorthLink#s freight sailings have been cancelled, the ferry operator has advised.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4285900.jpg--.jpg?1638548013000\n","title":"ballymena soprano catrina launches classical celtic christmas album","story":"BALLYMENA Soprano, Catrina Scullion, is launching her new album, “Classical Celtic Christmas”, in St Marys Church, Haddington Road, Dublin, tonight at pm.For those who cannot attend, the event will be broadcast virtually from the church.To watch this event please visit https:www.stmaryshaddingtonroad.ie Popular songs will include O Holy Night and Silent Night.Catrinas CD will be available in the Repository at All Saints Church, Ballymena, for pound, with proceeds being donated to St Vincent DePaul.It is hoped the local community in Ballymena will tune in and support Catrina.The Ballymenachatted to Catrina this week.

Led by Linzi McGaughey and Clare Caulfield, the group reached far and wide across the borough to ask for materials and sewers who could turn the materials into scrubs.“Such was the scale of the operation, and the scale of the generosity of local people, that soon teams of people had to be drafted in to help source, sort and allocate materials to the sewers. Sewing machines were dusted off, and a real dference was made to our frontline healthcare system.“Local businesses and communities got behind the group with fundraising, and the demand for their scrubs just kept growing. Up to  hours a day was spent taking orders directly from the hospitals, doctors, nurses, community workers, and care homes. We are all indebted to this group of amazing people, and it was wonderful to be able to view their latest creation in quilt form as a testament to all of their hard work and dedication.”Health Minister Robin Swann added: “The pandemic will be etched in our memories as one of the most challenging, anxious and indeed sad periods in our history but for me it will also be a time when we saw humanity at its very best. Despite adversity, we witnessed teams of volunteers, like NI Scrubs, step forward and achieve so much.“You should all be very proud of the contribution you made and you have my sincere appreciation for your efforts. There is no doubt that Covid has been a hugely challenging time for everyone and this is particularly true for those working in our health and social care services. The tapestry is a very fitting tribute to all the staff who worked tirelessly and courageously for us throughout the pandemic.“I want to again place on record my thanks to every single one of our health and social care workers for everything they do, every day.”Accepting the tapestry on behalf of Northern Health and Social Care Trust, Chairman Bob McCann, said: “I would like to thank the NI Scrubs volunteers for this very poignant and reflective piece of art, which in years to come will be a very important reminder of how far we all came in the fight against COVID-.“The pandemic has clearly had a signicant and sustained impact on all aspects of our health service and our staff have faced many challenges over the course of the last  months. I know that staff were very appreciative of initiatives such as that of NI Scrubs and the generosity and kindness shown to staff buoyed them during some of the darkest days.”Clare Caulfield from NI Scrubs said the tapestry was “a wonderful legacy” to all those who played their part.She added: “At the time we asked all our volunteers to give us a piece of material with their initials on it. We asked them to send the pieces in but we didnt tell them what we were going to do with them. “We had them made into a large tapestry, a wonderful legacy to everyone involved.” Clare continued: “The huge effort of every volunteer will be talked about for generations. It is mine and Linzi’s honour to have played a small part in this incredible team of amazing iniduals who stepped up when our country needed kindness, support and community the most.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4283615.jpg--.jpg?1638527740000\n","title":"demand high for booster jabs says trust","story":"The Seven Towers Mass Vaccination Centre is open for booster jabs for those aged over  group as per Department of Health guidance.

Butwe were all truly honest, isn’t it the side dishes we’re actually looking forward to most  googletag.cmd.push Pigs in blankets, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, roasted parsnips, stuffing… these tasty jewels beside the golden bird are arguably the best bit. We asked some celeb chefs and food writers to share their favourite festive sides, with tips for how to cook them too… . Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” . Mary Berry champions the good old celeriac       “I love celeriac,” says Mary Berry . “I just cook it until it’s soft. It’s knobbly. If you grow it, it doesn’t come to fruition until November. You can buy it earlier. And I cook it until it’s tender then add full-fat cregraveme fresh to it and puree it. It is delicious. It reheats well.” She also makes chestnut stuffing. “I do them the day before and I do it in small shapes and fry them, then all I’ve got to do is reheat them.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. . Is it going to look fabulous under the tree   It’s a minor consideration, but Brookes saysyou make the unwrapping experience a joyful one it can add that little bit of lovely Christmas sparkle to yourgt. “Ribbons, fabric, or even a drop of festive essential oil on the wrapping paper always work wonders,” she adds.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

My whole le came to a halt.Derry Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch aims to raise more awareness and funds for an “illness we don’t talk about enough” Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseReporter: Nicole Lang Dec   addthis, Leslie Hill was sadly diagnosed with Parkinsons disease in April . googletag.cmd.push Parkinsons disease is a condition that affects the brain. It causes problems like shaking and stfness that get worse over time. The main symptoms of the disease are shaking, slow movements and stfness. Treatments for Parkinsons disease include therapies to help with movement problems, medicines and sometimes brain surgery. Parkinsons disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. It’s not yet clear exactly why this happens. Leslie’s first symptoms were shown in his handwriting when it was still neat but very small. Then, in January , the -year-old, was getting ready to go to the dentist when his left hand would not move to brush his teeth. Leslie said: “After several attempts to brush my teeth, I realised something wasnt right. I contacted my GP and was sent to the hospital to do tests. “I was kept in for five days and had numerous tests. It was then that I was diagnosed. My whole le came to a halt. “Shortly after, I became a member of Parkinsons Foyle branch. I really enjoyed and appreciated the support that I got. “I helped to organise events and helped with fundraising. I was a committee member within six months and then I was asked to become Chairman. “It is and was such an honour, I was very pleased to be voted in. I have a vice chairman, Jackie Brolly. “There is a committee of  dedicated members, nothing is a bother to them. My we Rhonda is the secretary and Wendy Stuart is treasurer. “We have approximately  members and we are all one big family. “I have been acting Chairman since September  and officially since March . During my time as Chairman, we have given approximatelyfive to six thousand pounds every year to Parkinson’s research.” Parkinson’s Foyle Branch is a self-funded charity and they depend on the generosity of members of the public to keep the branch going. Their mission is ‘Together we will find a cure, and improve le for everybody affected by Parkinson’s.’ Leslie continued: “We’re close to major breakthroughs. Funding the right research into the most promising treatments, we get closer to a cure every day. “Until then, were here for everyone affected by Parkinson’s. Fighting for fair treatment and better services. Making everyone see its real impact. “People with Parkinson’s, scientists and supporters, fundraisers and families, carers and clinicians, all working side by side. “We are impatient for change, we’re taking a stand, speaking out, chipping in, and playing our part. “I cannot thank the members of the public enough as they have been tremendous. We also organise events with the money we receive to help Parkinson’s patients. “This includes dancing to music, exercise classes, massage and reflexology classes, yoga and many more as exercise is a good medicine for Parkinsons sufferers. “In the month of March, we hold our Annual General Meeting.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  One hundred years ago this week, the Anglo-Irish Treaty to determine the future of Ireland and its relationship with the United Kingdom was signed at Downing Street after tense negotiation. The final outcome would have profound consequences for the city of Derry who would find itself relegated to border town status once the creation of the Northern Irish state loyal to the UK had been established. The Irish negotiators in London were Arthur Grfiths, Michael Collins, Robert Barton, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy. On the British side was David Lloyd George, Lord Birkenhead, Austen Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Sir Gordon Hewart and Sir Hamar Greenwood. What followed was the creation of the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. The British would also retain use of three ports – Berehaven and Spike Island in the south and Lough Swilly in Co. Donegal. A common assumption was this Treaty resulted in the partition of Ireland with six counties being formed as Northern Ireland and would remain part of the United Kingdom. However, partition had already been put into place on paper with the Government of Ireland Act in  with it taking effect on May , . All the Anglo-Irish Treaty did was give the devolved, and predominantly unionist government of Northern Ireland the option to opt out of being part of the new Irish Free State – which they duly exercised. But partition was not an idea born out of a hurried idea to provide a compromised or botched solution to the Irish Question. As Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University reveals, the seeds of it had been sown long before Michael Collins sat down to negotiate with Lloyd George. He said: “One hundred years ago, the issue of partition was on everyones minds in Derry and the North West. “It was first mentioned in the nineteenth century as a solution to, what was called at the time, The Irish Question – the idea that Ireland would be self-governing. “Obviously there was major opposition to that in Ulster from the unionist population. So the idea that partition may be a solution with Ulster being under Westminsters control while the rest of Ireland would be under a Dublin government really began to have an affect on Derry in the early part of the twentieth century. “Especially around the years  and  when Ulster unionism began to mobilise physically in terms of protests, the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Forceand the signing of the Ulster Covenant. “That really had a major impact on the North West – and Derry in particular. There was an eleven-year period then from  to  where partition was in the position that kind of like Brexit is today in that in the last five years or so it was the only thing that people were thinking about. “It did have an acute effect on Derry – particularly around  and , Derry was the centre of attention for the partition question because it was seen as the place most likely to see violence emerge as a result of those political discussions. “But of course everything changed following the outbreak of the First World War. After the war, isions became even more entrenched and violence became a reality instead of just a prospect.” While the British Government continued to hesitate over Home Rule for Ireland, Republican volunteers took matters into their own hands in  by launching the Easter Rising. Ultimately, this attempt to win independence from the British failed and the rebellion was crushed. However, the question of self-determination did not end with the execution of the risings leaders and a growing political force by the name of Sinn Feacutein more than made its mark with a stunning performance at the  General Election. The party went from only having six seats to  – including the constituency of Derry City. Dr Grant added: “The thing about the Derry parliamentary seat is that it was a swing seat – a bit like today with the Fermanagh and South Tyrone Westminster seat. “The Derry City seat was so contentious because most men had a vote in parliamentary elections but not in local elections – an issue that remained controversial right up to the early s. “With the parliamentary vote, nationalists and unionists were evenly split in terms of the voting rights in the city. So election results tended to go unionist-nationalist-unionist-nationalist throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century. “So it wasnt a huge surprise when Sinn Feacutein won it in . But at the same time, it was always very close and there was huge media attention on it because it was so close. “The big thing in  was that the Irish Parliamentary Partyand Sinn Feacutein made a pact in Ulster that meant Derry was kind of pre-decided almost for Sinn Feacutein. “The IPP pulled back and gave Sinn Feacutein a free run at Derry but they would have got free runs themselves where such as West Belfast for example when Sinn Feacutein pulled out there. “Cardinal Michael Logue – who was the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland – brokered a pact between Sinn Feacutein and the IPP as they were afraid that they would knock each other out in seats like Derry and West Belfast and let the Unionists in to sweep up the seats.”  Read more: When unionists lost control of Derry Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  With Sinn Feacuteins electoral success in the Derry City seat in  General Election, nationalists turned their eyes on local government. The running of affairs within Derry had been in the control of Protestants Unionists since the days of when King James II unsuccessfully laid siege to the city in . However, the introduction of a proportional electoral system for council elections had been introduced prior to the  local government poll – the result of which was seismic for Derry. A coalition of Sinn Feacutein, the Nationalist Party and an independent Nationalist councillor, Hugh ODoherty, won control of Derry Council from the Unionists by just two seats with ODoherty himself being appointed Mayor of the city. Not surprisingly, the result caused resentment amongst the Protestant and unionist community which spiralled into the Derry riots of June . Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “The riots of  in the city are interesting in that while partition had been on peoples minds, serious violence had not occurred in the city since  .   “The  election was signicant in that it was a landslide for Sinn Feacutein and the whole country changed politically. So there was a fear on the part of unionists of an independent Ireland. “But to my mind, the most signicant thing was the  local elections in January of that year. “The unionist minority in Derry had held control of the city since the siege in . So theyve had two hundred or so years of dominance. “Because of the introduction of proportional representation, for the first time ever, the nationalists and Sinn Feacutein took control over local government after winning a combined majority of just two. “That in turn meant the Mayor of Derry, Hugh ODoherty, was both a nationalist and the first Catholic to hold that position since . So that was a hugely signicant and symbolic event because it meant that control of local government had been taken out of the hands of unionists and into those of nationalists. “That was hugely important politically because all of the conversation in ,  and into  was about would there be partition  andthat was to happen, where would the line be drawn . “If Derry Corporation was under nationalist control, then the propaganda victory and the moral argument would have tipped the balance towards the argument that Derry should be a Free State city rather than a Northern Irish one. “So unionists were very nervous and scared of their futures because of those signicant changes that took place. Weekend by weekend throughout the year, there was violence, rioting and fighting in the streets that became more and more intense. “You had events in the south with IRA attacks and counter-attacks from the Black and Tans that made things in Derry even more intense and then it all kicked off one night in June . “It spiralled from the Diamond into the Fountain area followed by a counter-attack from the Bogside and by the end of the week, there were twenty people dead – a really, really terrible week in the citys history.”  Read more: Derry the centre of attention in Partition question Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

This week marks the centenary of The Anglo-Irish Treaty that would see Derry in a precarious position in its bid to be part of the new Irish Free StateReporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, This week marks the th anniversary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish Treaty. In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  The riots that took place in Derry in  eventually came to a close but tensions in the city were still on a powderkeg. While Sinn Feacutein held the Derry City Westminster constituencyand a Nationalist coalition in control of both the citys Council and the Mayors office, events where would decide the future of Derrys fortunes. Partition of the Ireland had been an idea since the nineteenth century but it became a reality late in  with the Government of Ireland Act. The bill meant that six of Irelands counties would form the state of Northern Ireland to be run by a devolved – and predominantly unionist – administration in Belfast. May  saw the enforcement of the Act and it left Derry cut off from the rest of Ireland – especially from the trade it had with neighbouring Co. Donegal. Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “Partition – on paper – took place as a result of the Government of Ireland Act in . That piece of legislation allowed for the creation of two separate parliaments of two politically jurisdictions – Northern Ireland in the six counties and Southern Ireland in the  counties. “Northern Ireland was founded with the unionist political establishment ran the legislation to establish a parliament, set up a police force and put into place the whole mechanisms of a government.  Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University  “Whereas in the south, the whole concept of there being a Southern Ireland never really took hold because it wasnt accepted by nationalists or Sinn Feacuteiners as a solution to the issue. “So essentially, the Government of Ireland Act was just ignored. The Southern Irish parliament was never founded which meant the  counties were in a state of limbo while Northern Ireland was being founded. “It was only when the Treaty negotiations took place that the concept of the Free State of Ireland came into play. “Though it had taken place on paper, actual partition didnt take place until after the Free State had been founded. “With the partition on paper, the news of that did not go down well at all with Derrys nationalist community. “I think that once that happened, it was just a matter for them to try and keep their heads down and use the power that they had gained in the local elections earlier in  to try and argue for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “There was a twin-strategy. The ultimate outcome would be a united Ireland that was independent – whether it would be a republic or not would be another point. There was a feeling that the IRA and Sinn Feacutein could achieve their aims and there would be no worries about partition and treat it asit was something to be ignored. “Others probably more realistically thought that partition was going to happen whatever the outcome was. For those nationalists and republicans, their strategy was to argue forcefully in the press and in the political circles for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “They went out mapping, interviewing people throughout the potential border area to ask their opinion on where they would like to reside and put out the message that Derry was a nationalist city and should not be included in Northern Ireland. “They also wanted to keep control of local government so they could continue to make that point.” While nationalists in Derry went about arguing their case, Michael Collins himself was planning a campaign of destabilisation to collapse the new Northern Ireland and have Derry and the North within the Free States fold. However, events close to home would prevent that. A turn that would have profound consequences on Derry for decades to come.  The second and final part of “Derry and the Anglo-Irish Treaty”, will be in next Mondays edition of The Derry News on December .

A Christmas adventure set in Derry is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Once upon a time, what started as a bedtime story could become a Christmas best-seller. googletag.cmd.push Derry-based writer, Robert Campbell, has released a new childrens novel, “Sled Down!” where four animal schoolchildren from Culmore venture into the city to save Christmas. The characters, Ralph , Susan , Finbarand Bettyget wind of Santas elves crashing the sled on a test run over the River Foyle and the reindeer have escaped. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is one and he makes his way inside Derrys Walls where he comes across an unscrupulous fake Santa Claus looking to use him to fleece the citys Christmas shoppers out of their cash. Robert,  and originally from Doagh in East Antrim, admitted the story started when he was making up a bedtime tale for his children and from there it grew into something more. He said: “Im not an author by profession although I have written other things. This is my first childrens story.  The author of a new childrens novel set in Derry, Sled Down!, Robert Campbell  “I have three young boys – Boyd , Henryand Adamand it was really a story that I told the children at bedtime and then I just sort of wrote it up properly and then published it. “The children seemed to enjoy my story. Generally they would give a pretty honest reaction on what they really think. Sothey enjoyed it, then maybe other children would too. “Without giving too much away about the plot, Santas elves have taken the sled out for a test run right before Christmas. “They have been messing about on the Foyle and have crashed the sled. “The animal children in the book get summoned by their headteacher, who has heard what has happened, to go and round up the loose reindeer and help get the sled back to their school in Culmore. “Meanwhile, around Derrys walls, there is a character who is a  Santa Claus and hes not very nice. “Hes managed to get a hold of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer himself and sets up a scheme to get people to have their picture taken with Rudolph for five pounds a go. “With Rudolph, the idea came about of where would he have gone to  following the sled crashing. “The bad Santa is not based on anyone in particular. Hes not really that bad except he is a bit of a chancer. Hes also up to a couple of other things that would not be classed as being environmentally friendly. “All the book is set in Derry. The walls get a mention as do the bridges where the elves are messing about with the sled. Culmore of course is mentioned as thats where the childrens school is. “Without giving too much away, like most Christmas tales, the day is saved by the children – although the real Santa makes an appearance as well.” Robert has been living in Derry for close to the last  years and admits that by setting the book in the city, he is paying homage to it. He added: “Im not actually from Derry myself. Im a blow-in from Doagh – near Ballyclare – in East Antrim. “My we is from Derry and Ive been living here for eleven or twelve years now. The book is probably a wee homage to Derry as well. “Its a lovely place up here. You could set a Christmas book anywhere but a festive story works perfectly well here. “Theres so many places in Derry that you could use for the book.” Robert Campbells book, “Sled Down!” is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street, Derry or from Amazon at: https:www.amazon Sled-Down-friends-rescue-Christmas dp BKNZQN  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

A Christmas adventure set in Derry is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Once upon a time, what started as a bedtime story could become a Christmas best-seller. googletag.cmd.push Derry-based writer, Robert Campbell, has released a new childrens novel, “Sled Down!” where four animal schoolchildren from Culmore venture into the city to save Christmas. The characters, Ralph , Susan , Finbarand Bettyget wind of Santas elves crashing the sled on a test run over the River Foyle and the reindeer have escaped. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is one and he makes his way inside Derrys Walls where he comes across an unscrupulous fake Santa Claus looking to use him to fleece the citys Christmas shoppers out of their cash. Robert,  and originally from Doagh in East Antrim, admitted the story started when he was making up a bedtime tale for his children and from there it grew into something more. He said: “Im not an author by profession although I have written other things. This is my first childrens story.  The author of a new childrens novel set in Derry, Sled Down!, Robert Campbell  “I have three young boys – Boyd , Henryand Adamand it was really a story that I told the children at bedtime and then I just sort of wrote it up properly and then published it. “The children seemed to enjoy my story. Generally they would give a pretty honest reaction on what they really think. Sothey enjoyed it, then maybe other children would too. “Without giving too much away about the plot, Santas elves have taken the sled out for a test run right before Christmas. “They have been messing about on the Foyle and have crashed the sled. “The animal children in the book get summoned by their headteacher, who has heard what has happened, to go and round up the loose reindeer and help get the sled back to their school in Culmore. “Meanwhile, around Derrys walls, there is a character who is a  Santa Claus and hes not very nice. “Hes managed to get a hold of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer himself and sets up a scheme to get people to have their picture taken with Rudolph for five pounds a go. “With Rudolph, the idea came about of where would he have gone to  following the sled crashing. “The bad Santa is not based on anyone in particular. Hes not really that bad except he is a bit of a chancer. Hes also up to a couple of other things that would not be classed as being environmentally friendly. “All the book is set in Derry. The walls get a mention as do the bridges where the elves are messing about with the sled. Culmore of course is mentioned as thats where the childrens school is. “Without giving too much away, like most Christmas tales, the day is saved by the children – although the real Santa makes an appearance as well.” Robert has been living in Derry for close to the last  years and admits that by setting the book in the city, he is paying homage to it. He added: “Im not actually from Derry myself. Im a blow-in from Doagh – near Ballyclare – in East Antrim. “My we is from Derry and Ive been living here for eleven or twelve years now. The book is probably a wee homage to Derry as well. “Its a lovely place up here. You could set a Christmas book anywhere but a festive story works perfectly well here. “Theres so many places in Derry that you could use for the book.” Robert Campbells book, “Sled Down!” is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street, Derry or from Amazon at: https:www.amazon Sled-Down-friends-rescue-Christmas dp BKNZQN  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

Reynolds had a previous spell at the club back in - under Stephen Kenny and he admitted he felt he had unfinished business at the Brandywell. “I’m not sureI ever thought I would arrive back here but it is a club I have a good affinity with,” he said. “I really enjoyed my spell here in  and . At times I felt like it was unfinished business that I would end up here at some stage because of the relationship I had with some of the people up here. I’m delighted to be here, it’s a new challenge and there’s a lot expected from us, but we’ll embrace that and enjoy it.” City boss Ruaidhri Higgins took his time deciding on his number two and feels he has now got the right man for the job. “Alan is a fantastic coach and it is important for me to have someone of his quality and experience here,” he stated. “He knows the league inside out and will have the trust of the players, which is key. He’s been here before which always helps as well, and he will bring plenty of ideas and energy to the club. “We are comfortable with where we are in our preparations for the new season and are looking forward to getting going again in the coming weeks. ”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

With  minutes played, the Maghera side trailed their Antrim counterparts by - to - and looked to be fading into the December chill. However, Thomas McKeagneys nd effort got St Pats moving again, and they had closed the gap to five points at the second half water break. When James Friels th minute free dropped straight to the net, it left just the minimum between the sides and Maghera outscored Garron Tower by - to - in the final ten minutes to take the spoils. The defeated St Killians side. The Derry men had started brightly too, and a Callum OKane brace had them - to - up after just five minutes, but a magnicent double save from Odhran McElhinney proved a warning for St Pats. Two huge frees from Joseph McLaughlin got St Killians off the mark, and after Niall McGarrell had put them ahead on  minutes, McLaughlins third gave them a - to - lead at the water break. Well in the ascendency, Garron Tower were swaggering, and hit three points in as many minutes from McLaughlin , Cormac McKeown and Niall McGarrell to extend the lead to five points. James Friel hit back with two long range frees, but a long range Padraig McKillop effort in stoppage time saw St Killians lead by - to - at the break. The Antrim side continued where they left off in the second half, another brace of McLaughlin frees and a McGarrell effort opening up a seven-point lead, but then things began to turn.  St Pats Knock out Our Ladys to reach Mageean semi final  The Maghera school will now meet St Killians, Garron Tower in the semi final.   Thomas McKeagney punched the air after hitting St Pats first second half score on  minutes, and Callum OKane wriggled free to point and leave them trailing - to - at the water break. Corner back Conor Shiels raised a roar from his team with a long-range free on  minutes to close the gap to three, before St Pats got the little bit of luck they were craving. James Friel sent in a long free, and despite several swinging hurls, the ball floated over them all and into the net. Another Shiels free levelled matters in the th minute, but the expected St Killians backlash never came, and McKeagney nudged Maghera in front on  minutes. A sublime sideline cut from Eoin Scullion doubled the lead three minutes later, before Conor Shiels third free opened a - to - gap. Only a goal would do for Garron Tower, but they watched in disappointment as Seanie McIntosh’s attempt at dropping the ball into the box floated over the bar, and Conor Shiels restored the three-point margin with a nd minute free, his fourth of the day. A satisfying comeback for the Maghera side, who will now contest a Mageean Cup final with either St Louis Ballymena or St Patricks Downpatrick, who meet at the Dub on Friday night.

The group, made up of Derry born singer harpist Gemma Doherty, of the Delacroix Dohertys, and Belfast-born singer Morgana MacIntyre, are currently playing their first tour in almost two years. googletag.cmd.push I caught up with Gemma after their triumphant Nerve Centre debut last weekend: What’s it like playing for crowds again after a year of livestreams  “It was amazing to see creative people come together and make some really special online shows in the absence of live music. “That said, it’s hard to beat the feeling of people coming together and experiencing something live in a room. “I really missed the feedback you get from the audience and how that feeds into the performance. “It can completely dictate the energy of a show, and that’s just not something you can create with only cameras in the room. “I think we’ve been a lot less nervous chatting and engaging with the audience since everything has opened back up, and we’re a lot more aware of being in the moment since it was taken away from us for a while.” Which do you prefer  Stripped down shows or playing with the full band  “I absolutely love playing the shows with the full band, especially with the seven-piece or the -piece band that we got to play with for our album livestream back in June. It’s a dream to hear the full scale of the album arrangements behind us when we’re on stage. “But I’ve been really enjoying the run of more intimate two-piece shows that we’ve been playing over the last few weeks. “When you strip the songs right back to their core, it becomes all about the vocals and finding the journey of each song with just one instrument behind it. “ We seem to lock into a dferent kind of flow and it feels like we’re engaging with the audience on a dferent level.” What was it like opening for Keane in America before lockdown  “It was great craic. Those were some of the biggest venues we’d ever played and the crowds and venues were beautul. “The last show we played in the states was in the stunning Dolby Theatre in LA where the Oscars had been held just a few weeks before. “It was supposed to be a  date tour, but we got to play  shows on the West Coast before things started closing down and we had to come home.” What’s been the best part of touring again and why was it playing Derry  “Hearing people sing along to the tunes from the second album has been really special, and as I mentioned before, being able to feel the audience in the room again and react to their energy. Derry was a class gig, we loved it. “It’s always a bit nerve-racking playing in your hometown, the stakes feel higher. “But it was the warmest welcome we could have asked for, and the same in Morgan’s hometown Belfast the following night.” Did you make any changes to the new album after lockdown delayed it’s release  “Thankfully we had just got our final mixes back around the beginning of March , and by the time the first lockdown hit we were already getting it mastered. It would have been so tempting to go back in and tweak it endlessly with the perceived extra time that lockdown gave us. I’m grateful in a way that it was finished before all that, and that it got to stay true to itself before the world went a bit mad.” How did it feel to win the NI Music Award’s Album of the Year   “Thank you! There were so many great albums out this year so we were genuinely shocked when it was announced. We missed the ceremony in the Ulster Hall unfortunately as we had a show in Waterford that night but we came off stage and looked at our phones and got a lovely surprise! And we got to celebrate properly a few nights later with the hometown shows in Derry and Belfast.” Other Voices is  this year. Want to share some memories of it from over the years  “Some of our favourite experiences as a band have been with the Other Voices gang. “There Courage livestreams were so inspiring and really set the bar for what a streamed experience could be, taking hold of some of the country’s most beautul spaces and opening them up in a new way. “We did an Other Voices livestream in the Guildhall last July with the string quartet from the Crash Ensemble and I think it was one of my favourite shows of all time. “ We’ve had some of the best weekends in Dingle over the years too, playing in St James’ Church in  was a massive one. “We met Lisa Hannigan for the first time outside the church after that gig, which lead to us going on tour with her a few months later, and having her feature on our most recent album.” Saint Sister’s brilliant second album, ‘Where I Should End,’ is available in Cool Discs on Foyle Street and other good record shops.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too.

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13259713.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Well maybe, but not as low as % which is now the accepted benchmark for making cataclysmic constitutional change. Still, % must be worrying for advocates of Irish unity.One of the consequences of a  years of partition is that most southerners don’t really know people from the north. And we don’t know them very well either. If Taoiseach Micheal Martin arrived at the average house in Northern Ireland he probably wouldn’t be recognised. It’s far more likely that he would be mistaken for someone who wanted to tarmac your driveway.Give anti-vaxxers the wrong treatment. For a broken leg prescribe listening to Van Morrison’s latest albumSo this poll is a real opportunity for unionism.Let’s face it Ulster Protestants have an, often unfair, reputation for being ... how can I put this politely ...dour, sour-baked, stubborn, thran, carnaptious and frankly unpleasant. This is a real asset to be exploited.So here’s my advice to unionists. Forget about trying to make Northern Ireland work, , instead concentrate on making yourselves so thoroughly obnoxious and unattractive as to ensure a landslide No vote down south. Unionists should immediately launch a campaign to put southerners off a United Ireland. We could call it “Operation You Couldn’t Like Us”This, of course, is where Jim Allister would really come in to his own. Exposing Jim to a southern audience and letting him just be himself is bound to enrage and alienate anyone who sees him. He should set up a southern branch of the TUV and run for the Dail and get on RTE as much as possible. But don’t stop there. Unionists should go on special missions down south with instructions to annoy as many people as possible. Firstly, every time you meet a southerner make sure to always call the south “Eire”. It really winds them up. Deliberately mispronounce Taoiseach and Tanaiste – to be fair unionists are already great at doing this — and always remember to roll your eyes and sigh when anyone speaks Irish.Keep reminding southerners that a British team won the All-Ireland this year. Also keep asking southerners what the All-Ireland is. Drop in to Aras an Uachtarain*and demand to know where the Deputy First President’s Office is.Send Stephen Nolan on a  county live tour and let people stare in amazement as he claims to be the “biggest show in the country”. “Country  The  Counties is a country  ”Or best of all just drive a big bus all around the south with a slogan written on the side of it: “Britain gives Northern Ireland £ billion a year. How much are you willing to pay ”That’s the Union safe for another  years. You can thank me later.• I would give anti-vaxxers medical treatment – the wrong treatmentHow has your week been Probably better than that of a North Macedonian women’s football fan. Or a Barbadian royalist. Or a council chief executive watching ‘Spotlight’. Mine was OK until I tried to watch ‘I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here’. I didn’t recognise any of the celebrities. My son said they were all Z list nobodies and were so obscure he was surprised I didn’t get the call.I didn’t let this annoy me because I’m an easy-going person, a stranger to anger. But I’m afraid to say that this week the mask-dodgers, Covid-sceptics and vaccine scaredy cats really are starting to challenge my natural equanimity.Three DUP MPs voted against mask-wearing. What have the DUP got against masks  Fair enough the Shinners have traditionally been very pro-mask. Especially in the s, s and s but that was pre-pandemic.Worst of all there was an anti-vax protest in Belfast last week during which a woman read out an anonymous letter from a ‘real’ nurse. Among the numerous ludicrous allegations in this farrago of fabrication and fakery was the claim that medical staff were being asked to lie in hospital beds and pretend to be sick with Covid. This was simultaneously hilarious and grossly offensive to hard-working NHS staff. But what can NHS staff do when faced with bare-faced liars  How do you deal with hysterical people who compare having to show a QR code on your phone to the Nazi death camps The Hippocratic Oath requires medical people to treat the ill, no matter how stupid those people are. I’m not saying that anti-vaxxers should be denied medical treatment. Of course not. I would give them medical treatment. But I would give them the wrong medical treatment. If an anti-vaxxer turns up at AE with a broken leg simply prescribe listening to Van Morrison’s latest album. It’ll take their mind off the pain. Or even better let these self-appointed medical experts treat each other. Anti-vaxxers should play Russian Roulette with their own health the same way they do with ours. Let Piers Corbyn do Paul Frew’s ingrown toenail. Let Paddy Barnes have a go at an appendectomy. After all they’ve all done their “own research”. How hard can it be  The Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Traditionreport has been published, after a long delay.Setting up such a commission was the right thing to do. If Northern Ireland is to be a harmonious, stable society in which people across the community can feel respected in their identity and cultural affiliations, then the very least we can do is try to navigate a way through these thorny topics.The report is  pages long so will take some time to absorb. That it has been able to make  recommendations given the breadth of its commissioner baseis progress of sorts.But on core topics such as flying flags from lamposts and public buildings, on terrorist memorials, and on the handling of bonfires there is no agreement.That Declan Kearney, the chairman of Sinn Fein, is calling for an “orderly implementation” of the proposals hardly gives cause for optimism about the likely fate of the report.While the approach of republicans towards, for example, the Northern Ireland centenary has been depressingly intransigent, in a way it has helped to clary things. There is no generosity and there seems to be little prospect of generosity.Disgracefully, Northern Ireland has not been allowed to celebrate its th birthday — we have not even been allowed to be marked at Stormont with a centenary stone. Not even a church service of celebration of our wonderful country .What chance is there of wider agreement And what prospect is there of consensus on bonfires given that Sinn Fein and the SDLP over the summer took to the courts to try to force a resolution to a contested bonfire in north Belfast  Or when there are efforts to float the idea of two national flags flying on public buildings in NI, which would be a symbolic undermining of UK sovereignty and the consent principle ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon will benefit from greenway works in Dromore and secure cycle parking, bike repair stands and cycle counters.Mrs Kelly said: “The announcement of an additional £m funding from SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon will benefit projects and people locally and across the North. Since becoming a minister, Nichola Mallon has made greenway and active travel projects a key priority for her and it’s great to see this delivery building on the success of other projects in this area. “In Upper Bann, cycle parking facilities and its usage have been generally very low but a large proportion are located on private land for customer use. However, the potential cycle parking solutions considered by Council offers a higher level of cycle parking given the visibility and security of the locations, followed by off street car parks, parks and then within the existing footways of the town centre. “The fact that SDLP Minister Mallon received more applications for funding than anticipated demonstrates the popularity of these projects and schemes across the North.“ The coronavirus pandemic highlighted the importance of having local greenways and outdoor spaces that people can enjoy and this funding commitment from the Minister will improve the lives of communities across the North. “The SDLP is determined to deliver the projects that matter to local people and I’m delighted to see SDLP Minister Mallon continue in this vein.” New hospital for Craigavon in limbo as Departments of Health and Finance wrangle over costEditor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.
