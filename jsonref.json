Opposite a country club, it was the biggest and \u0027flashiest\u0027 home that Meghan lived in during her youth. However, the inside was fraught with problems and was where Thomas Jr allegedly smoked weed all day, while dad Thomas Sr worked night and day           The Duchess of Sussex, here on her birthday August 4,  lived in multiple modest homes before finding fame with her role in Suits and marrying Prince HarryMeghan lived on the property until she was two years old and it was the biggest and \u0027flashiest\u0027 home she lived in during her youth.It was located opposite a country club - but the inside was fraught with problems, according to acclaimed biographer Andrew Morton, who wrote the book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess.Thomas Jr smoked weed all day and even her mother would share a joint with a neighbor, while TV lighting director Thomas worked night and day, and wild teen Samantha would be out clubbing.Doria and Thomas had married at the Self-Realization Fellowship Temple on Sunset Blvd, in a \u0027hippie wedding\u0027 in December 1979.They orced four years later and Meghan went to live with her mother in a top-floor apartment on S. Cloverdale Ave, Mid-Wilshire.It was once the garage and loft space for the main front property.This was recently renovated and is currently for rent at $3,950 a month, ten times what her mother would have been paying over 30 years previously.Although Meghan lived in modest homes, she attended a prestigious private nursery and kindergarten called Little Red Schoolhouse which starts at $18,800 a year for kindergarten and $22,600 year for sixth-grade.  After her parents orced in 1983, Meghan and her mother Doria moved into a top-floor apartment (pictured) in the Mid-Wilshire neighborhood of LA. The apartment previously served as the garage and loft space of the main front property. The Duchess of Sussex split her time here and at her father\u0027s home until she graduated high school in 1999    Meghan and Doria lived behind this two-bedroom, one bathroom house (pictured) on South Cloverdale Avenue. Their home was a short walk from Sunset Gower Studios where her father worked and where she spent time after schoolThe school was a short walk from Sunset Gower Studios where her Emmy-winning father worked on the set of Married With Children and where she would spend her days after school.Her mother Doria, 62, had a less glamorous location for her line of business, which was still only a stone\u0027s throw away from the school - now called the Hollywood Schoolhouse.She owned a gift shop called Distant Treasures and a clothing store called A Change of a Dress - both at the same location on N. La Brea St in Hancock Park for 14 years - until she went bankrupt in 2009. As can be seen in our photos, the run-down shopping precinct is now home to a liquor store, kosher market, and an aquarium, which is where Doria\u0027s shop was situated.When Meghan moved on to the $15,900-a-year Immaculate Heart High School, which she attended from 1991 to 1999, she lived with her dad on Vista Del Mar Avenue, a shabby street behind the Hollywood strip, only a few hundred yards from one of Scientology\u0027s most important buildings, founder L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition.This is where Thomas recently said in an interview that he\u0027d warned his daughter off the controversial religion after catching her lingering outside the building.Her father\u0027s apartment was on the ground floor and had two tiny bedrooms with bars across the windows.She lived there until she was 17. Now the place has been renovated, as photos show the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms that she shared with her dad throughout her teenage years.          Meghan\u0027s mother Doria, 62, previously owned a gift shop called Distant Treasures and a clothing store called A Change of a Dress - both at the same location on N. La Brea Ave in Hancock Park - just a few blocks away from Meghan\u0027s elementary school for 14 years - until she went bankrupt in 2009. The run-down shopping precinct is now home to a liquor store, kosher market, and an aquarium (pictured) which is where Doria\u0027s shop was situated          Meghan began splitting her time between her mom\u0027s house and her dad\u0027s Hollywood apartment (pictured) when she was 11 until she left for college in 1999. Thomas Sr was living in a two-bedroom ground floor flat on Vista Del Mar Avenue, a shabby street behind the Hollywood strip, only a few hundred yards from one of Scientology\u0027s most important buildings, founder L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition          Thomas Sr\u0027s apartment, pictured above with bars across the window, was a short distance to Meghan\u0027s high school. According to a biography on the duchess, \u0027it made sense for her to live with her father during the week,\u0027 however, as she got older, there was friction between the two since she felt she was the one who was mothering her father          Not so shabby: The home has since been renovated, as photos show the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms that she shared with her dad throughout her teenage years. Pictured above is the large living space of the Hollywood home   The two-bedroom, two-bath home located in the heart of Hollywood is now listed for rent. Pictured left is a renovated kitchen, while the right shows an upgraded living space with hardwood floors According to Morton\u0027s book, \u0027it made sense for her to live with her father during the week.\u0027\u0027It was a decision that would have far-reaching implications for the way she was seen by her new teachers and classmates…The older she became, the more she felt she was the one who was mothering her father. It was a source of friction, especially when she started dating,\u0027 the book states. Meghan also had various part-time jobs and volunteer work including bussing tables and serving food at the Hippie Kitchen in Downtown Los Angeles, a Catholic set up to help the homeless living in the notorious Skid Row.She was an assistant at the Paper Store in Beverly Hills, where she also taught calligraphy, and served frozen yogurt at Humphrey Yogart, in Sherman Oaks.When she left high school to attend Northwestern University in Illinois she met film producer Trevor Engelson in a bar on one of her visits back home in LA.Royal reporter claims journalists are being kept at a...Meghan Markle \u0027is at her wits\u0027 end over her father\u0027s public...Share this article \u0027When Meghan first met him on that night out in West Hollywood, she liked what she saw and was attracted to his passion, drive, and ambition. He was a guy with an aphorism for every occasion. \u0027Hope is the greatest currency we have in this business,\u0027 he told the wide-eyed wannabe.\u0027 True or not, it\u0027s a great pick-up line,\u0027 Morton wrote. The pair lived behind Whisky A Go-Go, a notorious club on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, where Engelson still lives today and Meghan resided there until getting her big break in Suits and relocating to Toronto for filming in 2011, orcing the 41-year-old two years later.    Meghan lived in different humble abodes growing up, but received a private education from kindergarten until high school. She attended Immaculate Heart High School (pictured) on Franklin Ave in Los Angeles from the age of 11 up to 18. Tuition is now $15,900 a year          She attended a prestigious private nursery and kindergarten school called Little Red Schoolhouse, pictured, which cost $18,800 a year for kindergarten. It is now called Hollywood Schoolhouse          This is where Meghan and her first husband Trevor Engleson lived - behind Whisky A Go-Go, a notorious club on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood on Hilldale Ave during their marriage until they split in 2013. Engelson reportedly still lives there todayYet it was her childhood that defined Meghan, the aspiring actress and now adored royal. \u0027While her childhood experiences were the crucible that set her on the path to activism,\u0027 says Morton.\u0027Her mother believes that she was hardwired from birth to try to make the world a better and more equal place. In short, she had a moral compass.\u0027Despite wanting to be a Hollywood star, it was her faith that was equally important and the central pillar for Meghan and Doria. So much so, that we can disclose she was once a youth minister for the Agape International Spiritual Center, which her mum is still a member today, along with TV host Oprah Winfrey.Sharon Fox, now an executive producer at California Motion Picture Company, was also a member and told her Facebook followers about bumping into the duchess and her husband Prince Harry in Dublin earlier this month.\u0027It was such a nice surprise to bump into them when I went to Dublin to view the Book of Kells. Meghan was very sweet and I had a short chat with her during her stop on the walk about regarding our church, the Agape International Spiritual Center, and our mutual minister, Reverend Michael Bernard Beckwith... Meghan was a youth minister at my church, Agape, in LA years ago when I used to volunteer with the babies and toddlers on Church Sunday at Agape… I can not recall if I ever met her back then but it is clear she radiates that Agape spirit where ever she goes.\u0027 Her new digs: Meghan\u0027s childhood homes are a far cry from her new home in Kensington Palace (pictured)           Meghan and Harry moved into Nottingham Cottage, opposite Princess Diana\u0027s former home "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/07/02/4EE37D9000000578-6033569-image-m-14_1533605788771.jpg","title":"David Victoria Beckham family caught Bali earthquake","story":"The Beckham family, from left Romeo, David, Victoria, Brooklyn, Cruz and Harper arrive in Bali, a few days before travelling to Lombok where the quake struck          The Beckham\u0027s two oldest children, Brooklyn and Romeo, aged 19 and 15, are pictured arriving in Bali with the rest of their family earlier in the week\u0027They certainly felt the earthquake.

Ola co-founder Bhavish Aggarwal said the ride-hailing company plans to expand its servicesWhy is Ola avoiding London?In Ola’s attempt to enter the UK market, it will avoid London, the capital city where Uber just managed to achieve a 15-month extension on its operating license and will begin operations in South Wales and Greater Manchester.Bhavish Aggarwal, the co-founder and CEO of Ola, said: ‘The UK is a fantastic place to do business and we look forward to providing a responsible, compelling, new service that can help the country meet its ever-demanding mobility needs.’‘We look forward to our continued engagement with policymakers and regulators as we expand across the country and build a company embedded in the UK.’Uber managed to save its London business temporarily and after a court appeal, it now offers free insurance, limited operating hours for drivers, a customer helpline and better handling of incidents during rides.Both companies are backed by Japan\u0027s SoftBank Group and recently ventured into the food delivery business, further intensifying their rivalry.   Ola could experience a better uptake because it allows customers to choose black cabs Compared to other cities, London has a stricter attitude towards new ride-hailing providers and Taxify OU is also in the midst of ongoing negotiations with the city’s transport regulator after being suspended in September.However, Ola could experience a better uptake because it allows customers to choose black cabs, the industry that has publicly resented ride-sharing apps. At present, Gett and mytaxi also provides this service.Ola will also offer voice support and options to share journey details with a passenger’s emergency contacts.Jennifer Aniston is worried about Brad Pitt over custody battle with Angelina JolieCelebrity Big Brother 2018: Coronation Street star Ryan Thomas threatens to pull outChuckleVision to be shown on BBC iPlayer in memory of Barry ChuckleHalsey met K-Pop superstars BTS in South KoreaJimmy Kimmel says Trump has done a \u0027good job of convicting himself\u0027 on TwitterInternational Cat Day 2018: Everything you need to knowWill The Bachelorette and Southern Charm crossover?

At £72.56 a month it wasn\u0027t cheap, but it gave them the peace of mind that their children George, 13, and Harry, ten, would be protected financially should either of them fall seriously ill. But when Steven\u0027s heart stopped in August last year, leaving him in a coma for 72 hours and requiring surgery, Aviva refused to pay the couple\u0027s claim.They said this was because Steven, 46, had suffered a cardiac arrest and not a heart attack — and Aviva had not updated its policy to include cover for cardiac arrest until July 7, which was 24 days after the Jacksons had signed up.Earlier this year Money Mail revealed how Aviva had also refused to pay Steven and Vicky Huddleston\u0027s £66,500 claim because he, too, had suffered a cardiac arrest and not a heart attack. The couple had bought their critical illness policy in 2002 — some 11 years before Aviva updated its terms and conditions.However, after Money Mail contacted Aviva, it offered to pay more than £20,000 to cover the couple\u0027s lost income.

Today, they cover as many 174, including cardiac arrest, Crohn\u0027s disease and benign spinal cord tumours, according to research by critical illness comparison firm CI Expert.Many older policies also contain far stricter terms and conditions. Up until 2015, for example, many major insurers said customers had to lose two limbs rather than one in order to qualify for a payout.They were also more strict on blindness claims. Previously they required customers to get a Snellen eye test score of 360 — i.e. someone can read a letter at three metres that a person with normal vision can read at 60 metres — whereas today it is typically 660.          In the Nineties, insurers typically offered cover for around 23 conditions. Today, they cover as many 174, including cardiac arrest, Crohn\u0027s disease and benign spinal cord tumours, according to research by critical illness comparison firm CI ExpertHowever, there are some instances where older policies provide better cover. For example, prior to 2003, many insurers paid out if customers were diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer. This condition is no longer covered because survival rates today are much higher.Between 2002 and 2010 insurers also stopped paying full claims for coronary angioplasty — to widen blocked arteries — as patients are now often able to leave hospital the same day.Alan Lakey, director of CI Expert, says: \u0027Over the years critical illness plans have improved immeasurably, but insurers do not have to inform existing customers of any changes or ask if they want to upgrade their cover.\u0027It means that if customers do not review their policies every couple of years, they could miss out on vital cover.\u0027Steven Jackson collapsed while at the gym. His heart had stopped and he needed CPR and two defibrillator shocks to get it going again. After being rushed to hospital the doctors said they thought he had suffered a cardiac arrest which may have been caused by a heart attack. They fitted him with a stent — a small mesh tube that is used to treat weak arteries — and put him into a coma for 72 hours.          Steven Jackson collapsed while at the gym. His heart had stopped and he needed CPR and two defibrillator shocks to get it going again (stock image)However, doctors later concluded there was not enough evidence that the cardiac arrest had been caused by a heart attack.According to the Aviva policy, a heart attack is \u0027the death of a portion of the heart muscle as a result of inadequate blood supply, as evidenced by an episode of typical chest pain, new electrocardiograph changes and the elevation of cardia enzymes\u0027.A cardiac arrest on the other hand is a disruption to the electrical system of the heart, causing it to stop beating.Julie, who works in a school office, says: \u0027We didn\u0027t even know there was a difference between the two.\u0027Aviva would have known when we bought our policy that they were about to change their terms and conditions, yet no one told us — and now they refuse to show any compassion when considering our case.\u0027A series of complications meant Steven was re-admitted to hospital twice, in October and November. He then had to return in March to have a permanent defibrillator fitted in his chest as he was at risk of another attack.      He missed around 18 weeks of work. And as an agency worker in the banking industry he was entitled only to statutory sick pay. Julie also had to reduce her hours to help care for her husband and children.The couple contacted Aviva on September 7 to make a claim for £251,352. Aviva then failed to tell them until January that they were not covered. When the couple complained, the insurer offered them £250 compensation for poor service. The Jacksons escalated their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, but it ruled in Aviva\u0027s favour.In its report the Ombudsman said: \u0027Although the terms heart attack and cardiac arrest can be used synonymously, there is a difference between the two and the plan schedule showed that the cover was limited to only certain types and severities of specified illnesses.\u0027An Ombudsman spokesman says: \u0027People take out critical illness cover in good faith, expecting the insurer will help them should they ever need to make a claim. But too often we hear from people, like the Jacksons, who only find out after they\u0027ve had an illness that it\u0027s not covered by their policy.\u0027An Aviva spokesman says: \u0027Mr Jackson\u0027s medical evidence was assessed against the terms of his contract and unfortunately, as his policy does not cover cardiac arrest, we were unable to accept the claim.\u0027With Mr Huddleston, we felt it appropriate to offer some support while he was under cardiology review and to assess if any other underlying cause was established that would alter our ability to pay his claim.\u0027We understand Mr Jackson has recovered and has returned to work, and, therefore, we do not feel ex gratia support is appropriate in his case.\u0027 £150 Expedia voucher to switch"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/09/4C59672C00000578-0-image-a-17_1526546481303.jpg","title":"Amsterdam introduce mop pauses red light district","story":"    Amsterdam becomes a \u0027lawless jungle\u0027 after dark according to the city\u0027s official ombudsmanBye bye beer bikes?

On top of this, in the past few months firms have slashed perks on current accounts and hiked credit card rates.Just last week Lloyds Banking Group revealed that its profits had jumped by almost a quarter to £3.1 billion in the first half of the year.HSBC has also reported a 4.6 per cent jump in its half-year profits to £8.3 billion. RBS announced last week it would be paying its first idend to investors in ten years after reporting a £1.8 billion profit.Ewen Stevenson, chief financial officer and executive director at RBS, then told analysts that the firm expected to make even more money from rising rates. Barclays and Santander reported declines in profits, but still made £1.7 billion and £903 million respectively.

This is Money podcastMORTGAGE COSTS ARE CREEPING UPMortgage borrowers have enjoyed record-low interest rates for many years, with some homeowners able to lock into two-year fixed deals as low as one per cent. But as interest rates begin to creep back up, lenders are looking for ways to make money from their customers.Around 1.3 million borrowers with mortgages that track the Bank of England base rate will already have seen their rate rise since last week, with some customers reporting that they had received emails and texts informing them that their bills were going to increase within minutes of the announcement.A further 1.8 million are on what is known as their lender\u0027s standard variable rate. Unlike with a fixed deal, which is protected from any rate rise for the duration of its term, banks and building societies are free to increase the cost of their standard variable deals at any time.          Mortgage borrowers have enjoyed record-low interest rates for many years, with some homeowners able to lock into two-year fixed deals as low as 1per cent. But as interest rates begin to creep back up, lenders are looking for ways to make money from their customersAnd less than a week after the Bank of England\u0027s decision to increase rates, Barclays, Lloyds, Halifax, Nationwide, TSB, the Co-operative Bank\u0027s Platform brand, Skipton BS and Danske Bank have already said they will pass on the entire 0.25 per cent hike.It means that anyone who does not realise their cheap fixed deal has expired, or is trapped on their lender\u0027s standard variable rate (SVR) because they do not meet new affordability rules, will see their monthly mortgage bills jump.Someone on the average standard variable rate of 4.72 per cent, for example, will see their rate rise to 4.97 per cent. On a typical £150,000 loan taken over 25 years, monthly repayments would increase from £853 to £874 — an extra £252 a year.Banks have been accused of treating loyal customers like cash cows, with the gap between what lenders charge new customers and those on a SVR ballooning five-fold in the past six years.For example, Yorkshire Building Society currently offers new customers with a 35 per cent deposit a 1.35 per cent two-year fix, while those on its standard variable rate pay 4.99 per cent. On a typical £150,000 home loan taken over 25 years, this is an extra £3,444 a year.Switching to a fixed-rate deal will shield borrowers from rate rises, but if you have waited until now to do so you may find you have missed out on the best deals.          Some banks and building societies began increasing fixed rates on mortgages as early as April when it was widely expected that the Bank of England would vote to increase interest rates in May. However, when no change was made, lenders failed to lower their rates againSome banks and building societies began increasing fixed rates on mortgages as early as April when it was widely expected that the Bank of England would vote to increase interest rates in May. However, when no change was made, lenders failed to lower their rates again.In January, borrowers looking to lock into a two-year fixed rate mortgage would have paid on average 2.35 per cent, according to data analysts Moneyfacts. In May, average rates for two-year deals had risen to 2.51 per cent, and today they stand at 2.53 per cent. Five-year fixed rates have also risen but at a slower pace from an average of 2.87 per cent in January to 2.9 1per cent in May, and 2.93 per cent in July.Around 28 mortgage lenders also increased their fixed rates in July ahead of last week\u0027s rate rise, but many of the changes were small as lenders did not want to deter new customers.Meanwhile, mortgage fees are creeping up. The average fee on a fixed mortgage deal is now £1,028, up from £1,019 at the start of the year, according to Moneyfacts.CREDIT CARD RATES SOAR Credit card interest rates have jumped to a near record high over the past nine years. When the Bank of England base rate plunged to 0.5 per cent in 2009, the average credit card rate was 15.72 per cent, according to official figures. Yet despite interest rates remaining low, the average annual percentage rate (APR) has since rocketed by almost three percentage points to 18.26 per cent.It means that someone with a typical £1,000 balance would pay around £183 in interest over the course of a year compared with £157 before — an extra £26.And rates are continuing to inch up. Since March this year, Bank of Scotland, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds, M\u0026ampS Bank, Post Office Money and Sainsbury\u0027s Bank have all increased their credit card APRs by one percentage point from 18.9 per cent to 19.9 per cent. Experts say firms give a number of reasons, alongside wider interest rate rises, for pushing up rates.          Credit card interest rates have jumped to a near record high over the past nine yearsFor example, if the regulator finds evidence that credit card lending is hitting dangerous levels, firms may push up rates to put off the most risky borrowers.The cost of transferring debt to an interest-free card has also increased. At the start of the year the average balance transfer fee was 2.04 per cent, according to Moneyfacts. Today it\u0027s 2.15 per cent. On a £2,000 balance this would mean paying £43 instead of £40.80.Figures from the Office for National Statistics show households spent more than they earned last year for the first time since 1988. The average family went £900 in the red — yet banks keep encouraging us to borrow more on cards.Citizens Advice has warned some banks are upping credit limits without customers requesting an increase. Nearly six million people received an uninvited credit limit increase over a 12-month period, an average increase of £1,481.OVERDRAFTS RAKE IN BILLIONSBanks made around £2.3 billion from overdraft fees in 2016, according to the City watchdog. The majority of this came from planned overdrafts, with just under a third made up of unauthorised overdraft charges.This is where customers have accidentally slipped into the red without giving their bank warning and face hefty penalties. According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), around 13 million Britons use overdrafts and in the worst cases pay as much as £450 a year in fees.Currently, if customers exceed an agreed overdraft limit they are typically charged a set fee of between £5 and £10 per day, meaning they pay the same charges regardless of how much they go over their agreed limits. Customers typically pay between 0.1 per cent and 0.5 per cent per day in interest for an agreed overdraft, but this soars to more than 10 per cent when it is unauthorised.  £150 Expedia voucher to switch"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/07/21/4EE909CA00000578-6036869-image-a-3_1533674680856.jpg","title":"IRA mouthpiece Gerry Adams reveals writing Negotiators Cook Book","story":"    Gerry Adams (pictured), the former president of Sinn Fein – the political wing of the IRA has released The Negotations Cookbook that would contain recipes with ‘some of the best-kept secrets’ of the 1998 peace processEntitled The Negotiators’ Cook Book, it is expected to be printed before Christmas. The news that Mr Adams – who defended the IRA despite its atrocities during the Troubles – was trying to rebrand himself as a cuddly cookery writer was attacked by one of the group’s victims last night.Lord Tebbit, who had to be pulled out of the wreckage of the 1984 Brighton Bomb attack which paralysed his wife, told the Mail: ‘I hope it chokes him.’Mr Adams, who has always denied having been a member of the IRA, gave details of the book during a talk at a festival in west Belfast on Monday.And he also revealed he was a fan of many British children’s books such as the works of Enid Blyton, Biggles, Roy of the Rovers and the Just William series.

This is Money podcastMORTGAGE COSTS ARE CREEPING UPMortgage borrowers have enjoyed record-low interest rates for many years, with some homeowners able to lock into two-year fixed deals as low as one per cent. But as interest rates begin to creep back up, lenders are looking for ways to make money from their customers.Around 1.3 million borrowers with mortgages that track the Bank of England base rate will already have seen their rate rise since last week, with some customers reporting that they had received emails and texts informing them that their bills were going to increase within minutes of the announcement.A further 1.8 million are on what is known as their lender\u0027s standard variable rate. Unlike with a fixed deal, which is protected from any rate rise for the duration of its term, banks and building societies are free to increase the cost of their standard variable deals at any time.          Mortgage borrowers have enjoyed record-low interest rates for many years, with some homeowners able to lock into two-year fixed deals as low as 1per cent. But as interest rates begin to creep back up, lenders are looking for ways to make money from their customersAnd less than a week after the Bank of England\u0027s decision to increase rates, Barclays, Lloyds, Halifax, Nationwide, TSB, the Co-operative Bank\u0027s Platform brand, Skipton BS and Danske Bank have already said they will pass on the entire 0.25 per cent hike.It means that anyone who does not realise their cheap fixed deal has expired, or is trapped on their lender\u0027s standard variable rate (SVR) because they do not meet new affordability rules, will see their monthly mortgage bills jump.Someone on the average standard variable rate of 4.72 per cent, for example, will see their rate rise to 4.97 per cent. On a typical £150,000 loan taken over 25 years, monthly repayments would increase from £853 to £874 — an extra £252 a year.Banks have been accused of treating loyal customers like cash cows, with the gap between what lenders charge new customers and those on a SVR ballooning five-fold in the past six years.For example, Yorkshire Building Society currently offers new customers with a 35 per cent deposit a 1.35 per cent two-year fix, while those on its standard variable rate pay 4.99 per cent. On a typical £150,000 home loan taken over 25 years, this is an extra £3,444 a year.Switching to a fixed-rate deal will shield borrowers from rate rises, but if you have waited until now to do so you may find you have missed out on the best deals.          Some banks and building societies began increasing fixed rates on mortgages as early as April when it was widely expected that the Bank of England would vote to increase interest rates in May. However, when no change was made, lenders failed to lower their rates againSome banks and building societies began increasing fixed rates on mortgages as early as April when it was widely expected that the Bank of England would vote to increase interest rates in May. However, when no change was made, lenders failed to lower their rates again.In January, borrowers looking to lock into a two-year fixed rate mortgage would have paid on average 2.35 per cent, according to data analysts Moneyfacts. In May, average rates for two-year deals had risen to 2.51 per cent, and today they stand at 2.53 per cent. Five-year fixed rates have also risen but at a slower pace from an average of 2.87 per cent in January to 2.9 1per cent in May, and 2.93 per cent in July.Around 28 mortgage lenders also increased their fixed rates in July ahead of last week\u0027s rate rise, but many of the changes were small as lenders did not want to deter new customers.Meanwhile, mortgage fees are creeping up. The average fee on a fixed mortgage deal is now £1,028, up from £1,019 at the start of the year, according to Moneyfacts.CREDIT CARD RATES SOAR Credit card interest rates have jumped to a near record high over the past nine years. When the Bank of England base rate plunged to 0.5 per cent in 2009, the average credit card rate was 15.72 per cent, according to official figures. Yet despite interest rates remaining low, the average annual percentage rate (APR) has since rocketed by almost three percentage points to 18.26 per cent.It means that someone with a typical £1,000 balance would pay around £183 in interest over the course of a year compared with £157 before — an extra £26.And rates are continuing to inch up. Since March this year, Bank of Scotland, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds, M\u0026ampS Bank, Post Office Money and Sainsbury\u0027s Bank have all increased their credit card APRs by one percentage point from 18.9 per cent to 19.9 per cent. Experts say firms give a number of reasons, alongside wider interest rate rises, for pushing up rates.          Credit card interest rates have jumped to a near record high over the past nine yearsFor example, if the regulator finds evidence that credit card lending is hitting dangerous levels, firms may push up rates to put off the most risky borrowers.The cost of transferring debt to an interest-free card has also increased. At the start of the year the average balance transfer fee was 2.04 per cent, according to Moneyfacts. Today it\u0027s 2.15 per cent. On a £2,000 balance this would mean paying £43 instead of £40.80.Figures from the Office for National Statistics show households spent more than they earned last year for the first time since 1988. The average family went £900 in the red — yet banks keep encouraging us to borrow more on cards.Citizens Advice has warned some banks are upping credit limits without customers requesting an increase. Nearly six million people received an uninvited credit limit increase over a 12-month period, an average increase of £1,481.OVERDRAFTS RAKE IN BILLIONSBanks made around £2.3 billion from overdraft fees in 2016, according to the City watchdog. The majority of this came from planned overdrafts, with just under a third made up of unauthorised overdraft charges.This is where customers have accidentally slipped into the red without giving their bank warning and face hefty penalties. According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), around 13 million Britons use overdrafts and in the worst cases pay as much as £450 a year in fees.Currently, if customers exceed an agreed overdraft limit they are typically charged a set fee of between £5 and £10 per day, meaning they pay the same charges regardless of how much they go over their agreed limits. Customers typically pay between 0.1 per cent and 0.5 per cent per day in interest for an agreed overdraft, but this soars to more than 10 per cent when it is unauthorised.  £150 Expedia voucher to switch"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/07/21/4EE909CA00000578-6036869-image-a-3_1533674680856.jpg","title":"IRA mouthpiece Gerry Adams reveals writing Negotiators Cook Book","story":"    Gerry Adams (pictured), the former president of Sinn Fein – the political wing of the IRA has released The Negotations Cookbook that would contain recipes with ‘some of the best-kept secrets’ of the 1998 peace processEntitled The Negotiators’ Cook Book, it is expected to be printed before Christmas. The news that Mr Adams – who defended the IRA despite its atrocities during the Troubles – was trying to rebrand himself as a cuddly cookery writer was attacked by one of the group’s victims last night.Lord Tebbit, who had to be pulled out of the wreckage of the 1984 Brighton Bomb attack which paralysed his wife, told the Mail: ‘I hope it chokes him.’Mr Adams, who has always denied having been a member of the IRA, gave details of the book during a talk at a festival in west Belfast on Monday.And he also revealed he was a fan of many British children’s books such as the works of Enid Blyton, Biggles, Roy of the Rovers and the Just William series.

The Labour leader said the view that Israel has a right to exist was an example of the BBC\u0027s bias toward the country ‘There is pressure on the BBC from probably Mark Thompson, who seems to me to have an agenda in this respect,’ he said.‘There seems to be a great deal of pressure on the BBC from the Israeli government and the Israeli embassy, and they are very assertive towards all journalists and to the BBC itself – they challenge every single thing on reporting the whole time. Labour moderates in secret plot to oust Jeremy Corbyn are...Labour DROPS probe into veteran MP Margaret Hodge for...Share this article\u0027I think there is a bias towards saying that Israel is a democracy in the Middle East, that Israel has a right to exist, that Israel has its security concerns.’Reacting, Jewish Leadership Council chief executive Simon Johnson said the comments were at odds with Labour’s policy on Israel.          Dame Margaret Hodge (pictured) has described her own party as a \u0027hostile environment for Jews\u0027 He said: ‘Sorry Mr Corbyn. Do you therefore think that Israel is not a democracy, does not have a right to exist and does not have security concerns? And that an organisation is biased if it does believe these things? Wow.’Jennifer Gerber, director of Labour Friends of Israel, said: ‘The Labour Party is now defending Jeremy Corbyn peddling wild conspiracy theories and questioning Israel’s right to exist on Iranian state TV. For a party which aspires to be in government, this is not normal behaviour.’Labour’s new code of conduct had omitted four IHRA examples of anti-Semitism, though it was later suggested Mr Corbyn would adopt three of those four tenets for its own anti-Semitism definition.           Jeremy Corbyn came under fire for this appearance on Iranian state TV as concerns about anti-Semitism continue to dog his leadership But Dame Margaret criticised his handling of the issue. And it emerged last night that members of the We Support Jeremy Corbyn Facebook group have attacked the peer. One member sarcastically wrote: ‘Please stay Margaret, we need the right kind of Jew in the party like you.’ Others described her as ‘scum’, ‘parasite’, ‘treacherous fraud’ and ‘bitch’.Yesterday Dame Margaret attacked the Labour leadership’s ‘bullying’ approach to critics – and said she was in ‘no doubt’ figures at the top of the party want to purge opponents of the leader.She told the Evening Standard the party had become a ‘hostile environment for Jews’. Discussing Mr Corbyn’s comments from 2011, a Labour spokesman said the remarks were taken out of context and the leader supported a two-state solution. He added: ‘Jeremy was arguing that, despite... the lack of a Palestinian state, Israeli concerns and perspectives are more likely to appear prominently in news reporting than Palestinian ones.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/03/15/4ECCB69900000578-0-image-a-65_1533305524229.jpg","title":"New audio reveals details day 1966 pupils saw UFO Australias largest mass sighting","story":"Rapidly moving UFO is accidentally caught on camera as man...Share this article\u0027He called it the most amazing flying he had ever seen in his life,\u0027 McDonald added.\u0027The planes were doing everything possible to approach the object and he said how they all avoided collision he will never know.\u0027Every time they got too close to the object it would slowly accelerate, then rapidly accelerate and then move away from them and stop.

He is standing trial alongside Ryan Hale, 27, and Ryan Ali, 28 – two men he allegedly knocked out in a brawl near the club.Prosecutors allege trouble flared after Stokes and Mr Hales caught up with Ali, Hale, Mr O\u0027Connor and Mr Barry on a nearby street. The cricketer is accused of knocking out Hale and Ali. Ali allegedly threatened Mr Hales with a bottle, with Hale said to have picked up a metal pole from a street sign.              Stokes starred in the cricket last week (pictured) as England beat India at EdgbastonStokes claims he was acting in self-defence and took action after Ali and Hale were homophobic towards Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor. But Nicholas Corsellis, prosecuting, said Stokes was instead acting with \u0027revenge, retaliation or punishment in mind\u0027.The jury also heard allegations that Mr Hales kicked the prostrate Ali in the head. Mr Hales was not arrested but interviewed under caution in connection with the fight. He was never charged.The Nottinghamshire batsman, 29, had been credited by the prosecution with trying to calm the fight. But when the jury were shown footage of the incident by Detective Constable Daniel Adams, Hale\u0027s barrister Stephen Mooney asked him: \u0027What I am going to suggest you see here is Alex Hales stamping down upon Ryan Ali at least twice. Does that accord with what you see?\u0027DC Adams replied: \u0027Yes, a stamp or a kick.\u0027 Mr Mooney said: \u0027We have someone lying on the floor, Ryan Ali, and just above him, moving towards him is Mr Alex Hales.

These include limiting tweet visibility, requiring a user to delete a tweet, placing accounts in read-only mode or, for more serious or repeat offences, permanently suspending an account.” A professor of internet studies at Deakin University, Matthew Allen, says the social media platforms have open platform policies that often result in the publication of material that violates community standards in Australia.“The default business model for all social media platforms is to encourage as much use as possible and to permit users to do and say almost anything, and then to react when negative publicity about such posts outweighs the revenue generated by having an open platform,” Allen told  Australia.Allen does not believe the global media platforms have got the balance right but cautions against tougher regulation.“That’s the philosophical challenge we face if we were to overreact to largely inappropriate commentary. Is it not better to know that Cottrell thinks and says those things?”Allen says social media has joined the mainstream media as a powerful force in determining community standards but its decisions about appropriate content are unregulated and secretive.“Social media organisations are now one of the primary regulators of speech in society and, as events of the last year have shown, they have a poor track record of proactively managing speech which may be deemed inappropriate,” he says.Allen says there is so much content on social media it is impossible to keep abreast of it, although the platforms are now using artificial intelligence to flag problematic behaviour.“There is a concern if they were to be more active regulators because they do not necessarily embody community standards in the other direction,” he says. “How would we frame it when we think they’re doing too much?“It’s a very difficult balancing act. But the challenge is that underpinning all of this is the profit motive. And the capacity of these organisations to manage and mandate their activities based on hypothetical global norms rather than national standards.”Access to the social media networks is vital to people like Cottrell, who encourages people to contact him on social media for more information about his political activities. The social media platforms are slow to act and all have different thresholds. Just take the recent case of Alex Jones.Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify have all banned the American conspiracy theorist from their platforms, saying he promoted hate speech and violence, but Twitter has allowed Jones to continue posting on the platform. Its founder, Jack Dorsey, said the company was committed to promoting “a healthy conversational environment” – which included Jones because he “hasn’t violated our rules” ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70198efce20be3cb7933cffbf1d6be5e472eb113/1_0_1768_1061/master/1768.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90c5d271e6c4c356dc36d16ef79f6df2","title":"fanfiction fifty shades star trek harry potter","story":"Since it began in the 1960s, fanfiction has been both loved and dismissed as the work of nerdy amateurs. Now, a new generation of authors is dissolving the distinctionDevotees of fanfiction will sometimes tell you that it’s one of the oldest writing forms in the world. Seen with this generous eye, the art of writing stories using other people’s creations hails from long before our awareness of Twilight-fanfic-turned-BDSM romance Fifty Shades of Grey: perhaps Virgil, when he picked up where Homer left off with the story of Aeneas, or Shakespeare’s retelling of Arthur Brookes’s 1562 The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet. What most of us would recognise as fanfiction began in the 1960s, when Star Trek fans started creating zines about Spock and Captain Kirk’s adventures. Thirty years later, the internet arrived, which made sharing stories set in other people’s worlds – be they Harry Potter, Spider-Man, or anything and everything in between – easier. Fanfiction has always been out there, if you knew where to look. Now, it’s almost impossible to miss.In the last few years, fanfiction has enjoyed something of a rebrand. Big-name authors such as EL James, author of the Fifty Shades books, and Cassandra Clare, who has always been open about writing Harry Potter fanfiction before her bestselling Mortal Instruments series, have helped bring it into the mainstream. These days, it’s fairly common knowledge that some people just really like writing about Captain America and Bucky Barnes falling in love, or Doctor Who fighting demons with Buffy. The general image of fanfiction has brightened somewhat: less creepy, more sweetly nerdy.“Here’s the thing,” Naomi Novik explains over the phone from New York. She is the bestselling author of the Temeraire books, a fantasy series that adds dragons to the Napoleonic Wars, and Spinning Silver, which riffs on Rumpelstiltskin. “I don’t actually draw any line between my fanfiction work and my professional work – except that I only write the fanfiction stuff for love.”In between writing her novels – or indeed during, as she admits that fanfiction is one of her favourite procrastination techniques – Novik is an active member of the fanfiction community. She is a co-founder of the Archive of Our Own (AO3), one of the most popular hosting websites, and a prolific writer in the universes of Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Merlin and many more. And she’s not the only professional at work. Rainbow Rowell, the bestselling author of Eleanor and Park and other novels, once told the Bookseller that between two novels, she wrote a 30,000-word Harry Potter fanfiction. “It’s Harry and Draco as a couple who have been married for many years, and they’re raising Harry’s kids,” she said. “It’s them dealing with attachment parenting and step-parents and all these middle-aged issues.”The ide between a fanfiction writer and an original fiction writer can look very arbitrary when looking at authors such as Michael Chabon, who once described his own novel Moonglow as “a Gravity’s Rainbow fanfic”. Or Madeline Miller, whose Orange-prize winning The Song of Achilles detailed the romantic relationship between Achilles and Patroclus, and whose latest novel Circe picks up on the witch who seduces Odysseus in the Odyssey. Miller said she was initially worried when one ex-boyfriend described her work as “Homeric fanfiction” but has since embraced her love of adapting and playing with Greek mythology. The tag could also be applied to classics such as Jean Rhys’s Wide Sargasso Sea, reworkings of Shakespeare by the likes of Margaret Atwood and Edward St Aubyn in the Hogarth series, and a spate of parodies: Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, or Android Karenina.“I believe that all art, if it’s any good, is in dialogue with other art,” Novik says. “Fanfiction feels to me like a more intimate conversation. It’s a conversation where you need the reader to really have a lot of detail at their fingertips.”For writers still wobbling on training wheels, fanfiction offers benefits: the immediate gratification of sharing writing without navigating publishers passionate readers who are already interested in the characters, and a collegial stream of feedback from fellow writers.“There was an audience of people who wanted to read my writing,” says young adult author Sarah Rees Brennan, who wrote Harry Potter fanfiction in her teens and twenties before she published her own novels, the latest of which, In Other Lands, was a Hugo award finalist. “Here were all these people online who wanted stories about familiar characters. Audiences were pre-invested and waiting.”For writers, whether already published or on the path to being published, this instantaneous readership functions as a writer’s workshop: Novik calls it a “community of your peers”. Spending hours thrashing out the details of Draco Malfoy’s inner life can’t help but function as a crash course in character motivation. And the limits and constraints of working within a pre-existing world, with its own characters and settings, is a unique challenge.“Fanfiction is a great incubator for writers,” Novik says. “The more constraints you have on you at the beginning, the better. It’s why people do writing exercises, or play scales. That kind of constraint forces you to practice certain skills, and then at a certain point you have the control to bring out the whole toolbox.”Once some writers get those tools, they never look back. Rees Brennan no longer writes fanfiction. “I had a friend say it’s like the difference between babysitting kids and having children of your own,” she says. “With a world you built yourself, and characters you built, there’s this sense of deep, overwhelming love.”But Rees Brennan is still a fan of collaborative writing and shared universes, as in the short stories she writes with Cassandra Clare about characters from Clare’s Mortal Instruments universe. “It’s amazing to gather around a kitchen table and yell at each other excitedly about what’s going to happen to mutually beloved characters,” she says. “I want that for every creative person – a chance to find their imaginative family, wherever it may be.”Novik scorns the idea that published authors should turn their back on fanfiction. She recalls being on a panel where one member said he couldn’t understand why someone would waste their time writing it over an original work: “I said, ‘Have you ever played an instrument?’ He was like, ‘Yeah, I play piano’. I said, ‘So, do you compose all your own music?’” “When I was first published, I deliberately went to my editors and said, ‘Yes, I’ve been writing fanfiction for 10 years. I love it.’ It was non-negotiable for me. As soon as you do that, by the way, it turns out that like half of the publishing industry has read or been involved in fanfiction,” she laughs. “Shockingly! It’s amazing how all these women who like storytelling have some connection to the community.”For Novik and many other writers, fanfiction is a fundamental a way of expressing oneself, of teasing out new ideas and finding a joyous way to engage with writing again after the hard slog of editing a novel. The journey to become a published writer isn’t a straight line it’s a spiral, as we grow older and continue to explore the characters and tropes we love. There’s so many stories waiting to be told – perhaps one or two of them could involve getting Captain America laid. God knows he needs it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07c4496555f4681a9d9f9194f6596699b74a859b/23_451_6661_3997/master/6661.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3aab0dc39c5a39618c90393226967d35","title":"in pursuit of civility by keith thomas review","story":"From terrible table manners to defecating in public to ideals of civilisation as a class weapon … a brilliant work by a consummate historianWe’re all appalled when we witness signs of the decline of civilisation. Whether it is the spread of casual xenophobia, the pollution of the oceans or the ubiquity of texting in restaurants, each of us carries around a mental picture of what an ideal society ought to look like, and an instinctive antipathy towards behaviours that don’t measure up. “That’s so uncivilised,” we think, contemplating Donald Trump, or an ugly facial tattoo, or someone noisily consuming smelly food on a crowded train.In truth, of course, standards of civility are changeable. As Keith Thomas points out in his wonderfully entertaining history, according to Giovanni della Casa, the 16th-century authority on polite behaviour, it was perfectly proper for the master of a household to relieve himself in front of his servants and inferiors. When King James I went out hunting all day, he similarly didn’t bother getting out of the saddle to answer calls of nature and when parliament met in Oxford in 1665-6, Charles II’s courtiers left behind “their excrements in every corner, in chimneys, studies, coal-houses, cellars”. Seventeenth-century searchers after potassium nitrate were keen to excavate under church floors, because they knew that, during services, “the women piss in their seats, which causes excellent saltpetre”. Visiting England in 1763, Casanova was startled to find people defecating in the streets: evidently he wasn’t used to such behaviour elsewhere.What really alarmed foreign visitors throughout this period, though, were the table manners of the English: using their fingers, belching and spitting at table and, especially, sharing drinking vessels. In 1784, a French observer was revolted by the sight of a group of 20 people all drinking beer from the same glass, while an English gentleman visiting Paris was surprised to discover that everyone was given their own goblet.Thomas, one of the English-speaking world’s greatest living historians, made his name in the 1960s as a pioneer of the anthropological approach to history. Since then, he has published pathbreaking books and essays on topics as varied as the sexual double standard, the decline of witchcraft, the history of farting, the purpose of life, and the relationship between humans and animals in premodern England. His latest work considers English attitudes to civilisation between about 1500 and 1800.It’s a characteristically huge subject: his approach encompasses not just civility in the sense of manners and interpersonal behaviour, but also civilisation, as both a process and a condition. As a consequence, the book touches on everything from the practice of warfare, to codes of speech, to the wellsprings of colonialism.Ideals of civility and civilisation, he argues, were ubiquitous in this era because they fulfilled two vital, though partly contradictory, functions. On the one hand, the distinction between “civilised” and “barbaric” behaviour was a powerful ideological tool, endlessly used to enforce hierarchies of sex, class, race and culture. The common people could never hope to be “polite”: their different dress, level of cleanliness, speech, food, table manners and sexual conventions confirmed their lesser status. The same was true of the Welsh, Scots and Irish, and even more so of nations further afield. Some commentators believed that even the Romans had not been truly civilised – because they didn’t know about gloves, or liked watching gladiators, or indulged in “unnatural vices”.In Pursuit of Civility pulls no punches in showing how the concept of civilisation was often merely a smug, prejudiced self-description, used to justify the merciless exploitation and extermination of “lesser” humans, both at home and abroad. In any case, as a hit play of 1713 explained, the civilising mission was good for the natives too, a means to “make human nature shine, reform the soul  And break our fierce barbarians into men”.Yet norms of civility also had another, more positive function. In an age in which religious, cultural and political passions were even more extreme than in our own, they enabled people to overcome deeply rooted and potentially dangerous differences, to live harmoniously side by side, and to discourse with one another without rancour, violence or abuse. Ultimately for Thomas this is their more important and enduring purpose, as “restraint, tolerance and mutual understanding” are the necessary preconditions for humans to coexist and flourish.Thomas’s working methods are as famous as they are inimitable. He reads everything. Not just the latest scholarship across innumerable topics, but also theorists – whether Marx and Engels, Gramsci or Bourdieu. Above all, his keen eye and omnivorous appetite has hoovered up thousands of telling quotations from the printed literature of the time. No wonder Hilary Mantel has proclaimed him her favourite historian. For the text is so thick with quotations that reading it is like listening to a continuous conversation between countless articulate voices from the past, periodically interspersed with Thomas’s own witty, self-effacing but deeply learned observations.Inevitably, in a work of such scale there are trade-offs. Time and again, the book skims in just a few paragraphs over complex subjects to which other scholars have devoted entire books. Its structure doesn’t easily allow us to grasp what the key changes were over the period, and why they happened. And the drawback of reading a history made up of quotations is that we never get to consider any inidual source or person in depth. But In Pursuit of Civility is nonetheless a beautifully written and continuously stimulating tour de force. It would be ill mannered to ask for more.• Fara Dabhoiwala’s The Origins of Sex is published by Penguin. In Pursuit of Civility is published by Yale.

Speaking six months after the relaunch, he added: “We have been working hard to iterate and improve Snapchat based on the feedback from our community.”Snapchat is dogged by many of the same issues it has always been: an appeal to teens and young adults but limited attributes for significant take-up beyond those age groups."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcce99d1968b6c6757832af10f3d9a988403b8b1/0_122_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d0ba8d2c51905b60fc5e2c5675144e3","title":"weight watchers oprah effect regain americans trust","story":"Strategy of targeting members’ general health as well as diet boosted by its star ambassadorThe Oprah effect has continued to work its magic for Weight Watchers, with the company reporting 1 million more members in a year and revenue up by one-fifth.It is a transformation that has made Winfrey, already worth about $3bn (£2.3bn), another fortune. Her stake, bought for $43m, had risen to more than $400m even after she sold one-quarter of her shares in March.In January 2015, Weight Watchers was in the doldrums and its management could not understand why. It was the new year and Americans were meant to be signing up to beat the flab. But nothing happened.Membership of the company, founded more than 50 years earlier, had been falling for a year even as obesity in the US was rising to record levels. What was wrong?It turned out US consumers had lost faith in diets – and companies dictating what they should weigh. Instead, consumers wanted wellbeing, which could include losing weight but also exercise and strength, both physical and mental.Weight Watchers replaced target weights with a broader healthy living plan, including exercise and supported by more emphasis on cognitive thinking. It also updated its apps and social media to help members improve their general health. Fitness tracking devices now offer FitPoints for activities such as walking, cleaning or dancing, which are used to calculate diet guidance.Not for the first time, the company contacted Winfrey, whose fluctuating weight was part of the personal story that had made Americans take her to their hearts. Winfrey had rebuffed earlier approaches, but in 2015, she agreed to promote the company, buying its shares and joining the board.The combination of tuning into consumers’ needs and nabbing the ultimate brand ambassador transformed Weight Watchers’ fortunes. The company piled on members and revenue soared. For the past year, the company’s growth has been led by its chief executive, Mindy Grossman, who had turned around the Home Shopping TV channel. The New York Times billed Grossman as the second coming of Jean Nidetch, the Brooklyn-born entrepreneur who founded Weight Watchers in the early 1960s.Last year, Grossman acknowledged Winfrey’s effect on the company, but said its renewed success was also down to getting things right for its customers. “We’re looking at the future of experiences and how you personalise it. We can inspire people to have healthy habits ... That’s not just about losing 10lbs, but creating a structure you can live within,” she said.Presenting the results this week, Grossman said Weight Watchers wanted to reach beyond its middle-aged female base to target men. The company has enlisted the producer DJ Khaled and the comedian Kevin Smith, who lost weight after a heart attack, as ambassadors in the US. Giudici said attempts to attract men and younger, more affluent female customers could fall flat or even backfire.  “They have been positioned very strongly in serving mass market customers above the age of 35 and Oprah is the right influencer for that market,” he said. “They are now using influencers to try to tap into this new generation, but they need to keep focused on the mass market. There may be a trade-off. It remains to be seen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c80e7b74b1e499bd4dcb123febccedc958957877/0_1003_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3edc347e561c628b94d73f459c9afc5b","title":"earth wind and air filters how our environment affects our wellbeing","story":"Incorporating nature, water and the right colours and lighting into our built environments can have an immeasurable impact on our health, happiness and productivity – Gemma Askham explains whyVitamin NBiophilia may or may not be a word you’re familiar with, but it’s the reason that everything from your yoga studio to your accountant’s office has a peace lily in it. It was the title of a 1984 book by biologist Edward O Wilson, who claimed humans are genetically drawn to seek out and feel more zen in nature. In 2005, author Richard Louv proposed that not seeing your greens could cause Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD), a low-mood condition similar to Seasonal Affective Disorder (Sad).“Nature is good for us because humans are part of nature,” says Dr Miles Richardson, director of psychology at the University of Derby and founder of the Nature Connectedness Research Group. The science of why is down to a three circles model, where wellbeing is a delicately weighted balance between drive, contentment and threat. “Being constantly driven at work can mean our threat response is overactive, positive emotions are reduced, and we become anxious. Nature reduces sympathetic nervous activity associated with drive, and increases parasympathetic nervous activity associated with calm,” he says.  Relaxation comes whether you bathe in a forest or simply look at some roses – so it’s not necessarily being in nature that relaxes you, but feeling connected to it. “Simply noticing three good things in nature every day, such as a flower growing on the pavement, increases connectedness and, therefore, wellbeing,” adds Richardson. Light rightThere’s a reason that getting the window seat is such a big deal – it is, in fact, scientifically good for us. A study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that sitting by a window during your working day results in 46 minutes more sleep every night.Where windows-for-all isn’t an option, architects are plugging into the new trend for circadian lighting: LED systems that mimic the angle and colour of the sun to sync with our bodies’ awake and sleep cycles. “Evolution has led us to expect a bluer light in the afternoon and a redder light in the morning and evening. Manufacturers are starting to produce systems with wavelengths to echo this,” explains Joe Croft, head of environmental and sustainability at Overbury, a wellbeing-focused fit-out firm. Air-ratedPolluted air doesn’t just create temporary physical symptoms such as problematic skin, and irritated eyes, nose and throat, it also contributes to the risk of chronic illnesses – but new tech is assisting the fightback against bad air. “The world’s first smartphone with air-quality sensors was released in February. Soon, more and more people will have the technology in their pocket to measure the quality of air around them,” says Croft. Colour of creativityThe psychology of shades has been a talking, dressing and wall-painting point ever since psychologist Angela Wright identified how colour influences our reactions back in 1984. Today, much of the focus is on how our environment spurs creativity. Sensory “triggers”, such as different textures of materials, are thought to keep the brain engaged, improving our ability to access knowledge. The significance of colour is also now thought to vary depending on where you are. According to the Human Spaces report, creativity is best boosted by green and purple colours in the UK, red design accents in India and water features in Brazil. Immersed in waterThe effect of urban water on wellbeing is the very latest area of environmental research. While the value of green space is in no doubt – the charity Fields in Trust equates the health benefit of the UK’s parks to around £34bn – water features, such as rivers, are less well examined. A special project will look at how 18,000 Europeans’ lives are influenced by water, meaning we could soon be splashing around a new buzzword: blue health.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

Author and beauty expert Lindsey Kelk shares the latest intel on keeping your skin protected from its harmful effects  According to Dr Doris Day, “urban dust” has been shown to contain a cocktail of 224 toxic chemicals, making it possibly the only cocktail I have never been tempted to try, and all those chemicals can lead to a whole host of skin problems dryness, loss of collagen, acne and there has even been research linking air pollution to dark spots. Because getting those from too much sun wasn’t already enough of a problem … Start at the sourceAs we all know, prevention is always better than the cure – and while topical products designed to fight the effects of polluted air are a must, preventing damage before it takes place starts with your diet. A diet rich in antioxidants is the first way to help neutralise free radicals (those are the particles floating around in the air that attach themselves to your skin and damage it at a cellular level – find out more about these epidermal vampires here). Dr Andrew Weil recommends loading up on fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, watermelon, blueberries, carrots and leafy greens. On top of your fruits and veggies, protein is also key to rebuilding cells – your best bets are tofu, lean meat, fish, eggs, beans and nuts. As well as eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water is an essential factor in the fight against damage caused by pollution. Hydrated skin is healthy skin and ensures your epidermis – the top layer of skin and our barrier against all the chemicals and particles in the air – stays plump and in tact. For extra hydration and antioxidant protection, try adding green tea to your diet. It’s packed with catechins, which not only help your skin repair itself, they have also been proven to improve heart health and help combat hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Also, red wine is a great source of resveratrol, which is amazing for skin (and yes, I know the alcohol dehydrates my skin but the wine gods giveth and they taketh away). Get city-readyEven though people living in densely populated, urban areas are generally found to have better skincare regimens than those living in more rural areas, thanks to all the pollution we face – and the free radicals that accompany that pollution – our skin usually shows signs of ageing more quickly than our country-dwelling counterparts. This is where your choice of products really comes into play. Look out for formulas targeted specifically at protecting your face from pollution, then follow up with with the same considerations as with your diet. Every skincare expert you can name, from Caroline Hirons to Nadine Baggott, has extolled the wonders of vitamin C, the collagen-building wonder ingredient that brightens and evens tone, protects from free radicals and, some studies have shown, may even help protect against sun damage. It works well in conjunction with vitamin E, so look out for products that contain both.While it’s important to protect against free radicals, it is essential to protect against the effects of the sun. UV rays and pollution work in tandem to destroy skin cells and cause lasting damage so always make sure you have protection, all year round. Remember, if there is daylight, there are UV rays. Sunscreen is for life, not just bikini weather. And, yes, I know it sounds dull, but long sleeves and covered legs will help protect your skin even more. Physical barriers against the sun and polluted air are one of the reasons your body ages so much more slowly than your weather-battered face, so maybe try one of those surfer-chic long-sleeved swimsuits next time you’re at the lido.After exposureAt the end of the day, your skin will need serious cleansing, even if it doesn’t look dirty. Double cleansing is a must, for city and country dwellers alike. Over the course of a day, your face has had to deal with pollution, sunscreen and makeup and they’re just the best case scenarios. Thorough cleansing should never strip skin, you definitely don’t want to compromise your natural barriers. Try a cleansing balm for your first cleanse, to dislodge the daily grime then move on to a soothing cream or refreshing wash-off cleanser for the second cleanse, whatever feels best for your skin type. Post cleansing, your skin should feel soft and clean but never tight. Apply your treatment serums and moisturising creams immediately after cleansing. Leaving skin to “breathe” isn’t a real thing, as soon as you’ve rinsed away your cleanser, it starts losing moisture – skin doesn’t need to breath, it needs to be cared for so be a pal and give it what it wants: proper hydration.While the effects of pollution on the skin do sound really rather frightening, they don’t have to be. I’m probably not going to give up going outside for the sake of a smoother complexion, but with the right diet and skincare tips, I don’t have to. Gentle cleansing, a hardworking hydrating cream, daily SPF and lots of red wine, I mean, lots of water, should ensure glowing skin, wherever you may be.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

No other high school movie has affected me in quite the same way, nor offered a teenage female character like Veronica Sawyer that I could relate to as much. I didn’t see the film when it first came out I couldn’t have, it was made in 1988, the same year I was born, so it would be a long while before I got to see Winona Ryder in action. It would be another 14 years before I actually saw the movie, having stumbled across the VHS tape while perusing my parents’ collection and sneakily watching it after school one day.After that initial viewing, I must have watched it 100 times. I was in awe. The film was meant to be an antidote to the John Hughesian high school films that had dominated the earlier 1980s, like The Breakfast Club or Pretty in Pink, but even 14 years later it still functioned as a refreshing alternative to the teen comedies of the 2000s that skimmed over any real social or cultural comment on youth culture.What Heathers offered was an examination of rape culture, eating disorders, school shootings and teen suicide – all taboo subjects that the mainstream wouldn’t have deemed fit to be explored in a teen comedy. And it presents these dark themes through the perspective of an imperfect, and sometimes unsympathetic, female protagonist.Thankfully, when I was at secondary school, these weren’t exactly the issues I was dealing with but the dynamics of the social hierarchy were still pretty much the same. We all aspired to be the popular people at school, or at least their friends, and you often felt like you had to change yourself to get there: whether it be getting drunk on White Lightning on a Friday night or dumbing yourself down so you’d seem more appealing to the boys, and some of the girls too.Veronica had risen up the school ranks to “the Heathers” – the popular clique – before the movie had even started, earning a spot on their squad even though her name was nothing like theirs. That’s the first point you realise this girl was still an outsider: that, although she rolled with them between classes and after school, she was still an inidual who wanted to fight against their social dictatorship. Michael Lehmann, the film’s director, says this is the eternal appeal of Veronica, because “she could be on either side of the fence”.“She can hang with the geeks and hang with the people that were not being included but could also fit in with the group of powerful girls who rule the roost,” he explained. “I think we all relate to this because we all experience this. We want to be in the popular crowd, we want to be accepted by the people in power, in social power but, at the same time, if we identify at all with the people who are subjugated by that power then we fall into this moral no man’s land which is exactly what the story’s about.”High school is all about sheep and shepherds and, when I was a teen, I felt that as an outsider – a brown girl from London in a predominantly white northern school – I had to conform to what the popular kids thought was cool. However, seeing Veronica fight against this, dismantle the Heathers and their iron grip on Westerberg High, then walk off into the distance with the formerly bullied Martha Dunnstock, my 14-year-old self felt empowered to start embodying that attitude too. I stopped trying to dumb myself down, stopped feeling like I had to lose my virginity just because some of my peers had. I wasn’t suddenly wearing a red scrunchie and ruling the roost for the rest of my high school days, but Veronica helped me realise I didn’t need to put so much pressure on myself to conform to the status quo.That’s a timeless perspective that is relevant today as it was 16 and 30 years ago, and I will always hold it with me. Thank Heathers for Veronica.• Hanna Flint is a freelance writer and editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a251a08b26ac6625efa72e6ef123df0dee433291/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e6881804913f706ac18080dfe37ba8a","title":"ruby rose cast as lesbian superhero batwoman in new tv series","story":"The CW network casts gender-fluid Australian actor to be first openly gay lead of a live-action superhero showRuby Rose will play the first openly gay superhero in a TV series with her latest role as Batwoman.Rose’s Batwoman will be introduced to US television audiences on The CW network in a December crossover episode with its other DC Comics shows, including Arrow, The Flash and Supergirl.A standalone series about Batwoman, whose real name is Kate Kane, is in development for the 2019–20 US TV season. Kane is described as a highly trained street fighter with a passion for social justice and a flair for speaking her mind.Rose, 32, wrote Tuesday on Instagram that she was “thrilled and honored” and “an emotional wreck” over the news.“This is a childhood dream,” the Australian actor said. “This is something I would have died to have seen on TV when I was a young member of the LGBT community who never felt represented on tv and felt alone and different. Thank you everyone. Thank you god,” she wrote.Batwoman first appeared in the DC Comics universe as a romantic interest for Batman to dispel suggestions of his homosexuality, mainly in response to Senate subcommittee hearings in 1954 investigating the impact of comic books on juvenile delinquency.Batwoman has been openly gay in the comic books since 2006 when she was reintroduced as a lesbian of Jewish descent who found a love interest in former Gotham police detective Renee Montoya. DC Comics representatives said at the time that they made the decision to better reflect social ersity. The TV adaptation was announced in July.The Batwoman script will be written and co-executive-produced by The Vampire Diaires’ Caroline Dries. According to the casting description for the role, “Young Ms Kane is physically and intellectually confident while being a woman who is proud to be openly gay. However, Kate still deals with her inner demons that go back to her history with her dad. Their relationship is quite complicated as she struggles to get praise from him.“She once aspired to have a successful military career, but those dreams sadly came to an end as she was kicked out of West Point once she came out of the closet. But that didn’t stop her from becoming the crime-fighting vigilante known as Batwoman ...“While she has her shield up when fighting criminals, she lets herself be vulnerable when dating women.”Ruby Rose, an Australian actor, DJ, model and TV personality, first entered the public eye as a presenter on MTV Australia. She gained international recognition after she was cast in season three of the Netflix series Orange is the New Black.She also appears in Hollywood films The Meg, Pitch Perfect 3 and John Wick: Chapter 2.In 2014, she released a personal short film titled Break Free, which celebrates her gender fluidity.“As a little kid, I was convinced that I was a guy,” she told the  at the time. “I used to bind with ACE bandages, which is really, really bad for you. I was like, five or six? I was really young. I didn’t have anything there to bind! I used to sleep on my chest because I thought it would stop me from getting boobs. I used to pray to God that I wouldn’t get breasts.”She said as a teenager she tried to be feminine, “And then one day it just got too much. I shaved my head and just went ‘Fuck you’ to everyone who thought I need to look a certain way.”Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef692d03e43437b13506ada3671e8461bc232e25/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=105147ad355c7a4d41f4bb230db43270","title":"the september issues autumns big fashion magazines digested vogue elle","story":"Before you even think about shopping next season, memorise Givenchy’s look No 9 : an oversized zebra-print turtle-neck sweater worn over a high-shine black pencil skirt with monochrome court shoes.

The press samples of Victoria Beckham’s leopard-print coat must have racked up a lot of air miles, too.I know, I know – after a record-breaking heatwave you can barely recall what a jacket is, let alone a coat, so this feels way too theoretical.

In a double-page spread of coats featured in Vogue, more than half come with incorporated belts in Bazaar, camel coats by Versace and Alberta Ferretti are cinched by tan leather belts. No 2: the rich-girl just-stepped-out-of-a-limo, shoulder-robing thing is totally over. (Too Melania.) Wear your coat straight-up, sleeves and all.The skirt suit is cooler than the trousersuit for the first time in years. Chanel tweed two-pieces feature in Vogue and Bazaar Vogue also has a Marc Jacobs skirt suit while Bazaar has skirt suits by Dior and Gucci. If you stick to trousers, wear them wide-legged with a ladylike blouse and chunky trainers. “Embrace the neck-tie blouse and forgo structured blazers for relaxed tailoring,” advises Vogue.“Oversized dungrees take on new sensuality when worn over form-fitting Chanel,” advises Vogue.“Have fun clashing tartan with florals and leopard print, as seen at Michael Kors,” says Red.“Think of silver, like leopard, as a very modern neutral,” tips Bazaar’s fashion director Avril Mair.Slick Woods shows off her bump on the cover of Elle Cameron Russell holds her baby son Asa on the cover of Bazaar while Kanye West holds North and Saint inside. In her own mini power move, North West “wears her own clothes”, according to the credits, and has a plaster on her knee.Chip-shop counters are the new sunset. After Gucci’s campaign set Harry Styles against a St Albans frying counter, Vogue suggests “a Friday night special: Louis Vuitton and chips”, framing model Fran Summers in a £2,600 leather jacket accessorised with a chip fork in her local chippy in Richmond, North Yorkshire.Smiling (and even smizing) is over, as is the winsome chin-tuck-into-knitwear. Direct eye-contact with a borderline-challenging, did-you-spill-my-pint-mate vibe is de rigeur for models in the September issues. Extra points for holding your handbag as a “wristlet”, with the chain strap wound tightly around your fist, which suggests you might be about to launch it as a weapon.“Brobdingnagian” makes it into Vogue as the hot new word for oversized. Coined by Swift in Gulliver’s travels, it now applies to voluminous jackets and ultra-wide trousers. Elle champions “sustainability” as the season’s buzzword, with a special issue printed on recycled paper. Designer Kevin Germanier, whose glittery cycling shorts are featured in Elle, says: “I’m trying to challenge the aesthetic of sustainability, to educate people. If someone sees a nice dress, they are interested, and then I can say: ‘Did you know this is made from waste?’” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Its power is muffled, however, by a growing reliance on shopworn YA tropes and a general air of bet-hedging blandness. The pieces of a potential franchise are put in play here without stakes being raised or pulses quickened.The silly startpoint is a condition called Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration – its acronym a boon for fans of Lee and Herring’s Ian News sketches – which has obliterated much of America’s youth and left survivors with Jedi-like mind powers that pose an obvious threat to the country’s s. Heroine Ruby (Amandla Stenberg) flees the camps to land squarely between two boys: non-threatening proletarian pin-up Liam (Harris Dickinson, dialling back the complexity of last year’s Beach Rats) and sneering president’s son Clancy (Patrick Gibson). As has become YA-standard, this relatable playground melodrama is accorded the same dramatic weight as the end-of-the-world material.The further Ruby travels from custody, the more The Darkest Minds seems like an exercise in recycled teen wish-fulfilment. Our girl gets a Katniss-like makeover involving a flowing red dress, while the second half of the film is an extended layover at a postapocalyptic summer camp where everybody takes a telekinetic twirl. The leads are sympathetic – particularly Hunger Games alumna Stenberg, long on the verge of a breakthrough – but director Jennifer Yuh Nelson seems overly impatient to get on to Bracken’s later books, and the spectacle she generates is tentative at best, as if the studio wasn’t yet sure whether to go all-in on the budget.

Liverpool’s Champions League-winning manager of 2005 has said he sometimes feels he gets “punished” for improving players and, in Mike Ashley, he is employed by an owner delighted to inflict such pain.Ashley does not like splashing the cash on footballers so, possessing a manager capable of finishing mid-table with minimal outlay, represents nirvana to the sports retail magnate.Unfortunately he now seems in real peril of losing Benítez next summer – and perhaps before – with the manager seeming to be at the end of his tether as he enters the final year of his contract and continues to decline to sign a new deal. Granted there is a deterrent to resignation in the form of a clause in the contract stipulating that the manager must pay Ashley £6m if he quits – perhaps this is one reason why Benítez recently parted with his Spanish agent? – but as the months roll by, restraint of trade laws will surely dictate that it becomes obsolete. “I can’t guarantee what will happen,” says Benítez. “But in my head, it’s stay and fight.”The reluctance to allow any managerial speculation to accumulate is not merely restricted to transfers – where Newcastle are showing a healthy profit this summer – but extends to infrastructure. Indeed Ashley’s failure to provide assurances that he is willing to upgrade the training ground, under-23 set-up and academy largely explains why Benítez has claimed that “everything” is wrong behind the scenes at St James’ Park.The Spaniard is primarily concerned about the depth of his squad and though he this week managed to secure West Brom’s Salomón Rondón in a 12-month swap deal involving Dwight Gayle, he also wants a No 10, a centre-half and a left back, but claims to have “no idea” as to whether they will be secured. “The fans have to be concerned,” he said. “We are concerned. I’m really worried.”His anxieties are amplified by an unresolved debate between players and the board over bonus payments – which means the squad are currently refusing media commitments – but there has also been an erosion of trust between the manager and Lee Charnley, Newcastle’s MD who serves as a conduit between Ashley and Benítez.The latter is a practised politician but his latest complaints run much deeper than merely being a case of a coach putting pressure on his board before the closure of a transfer window.Perhaps by way of punishing the former Valencia, Liverpool, Internazionale, Chelsea, Napoli and Real Madrid manager for not agreeing that new deal, Benitez has been told he must sell to buy and will not be receiving the £45m he initially banked on spending.The suspicion is that while the latter remains hungry for trophies and European adventure, simply treading water in the Premier League with its gargantuan broadcast deal is sufficient for Ashley.Summer arrivals feature Martin Dubravka having made his move from Sparta Prague permanent for £4.5m, while Kenedy has also rejoined, on loan from Chelsea, Ki is now a midfield option after leaving Swansea on a free transfer and £3m transported Switzerland’s Fabian Schär from Deportivo La Coruña to Tyneside. A £9.5m deal for Mainz’s Japan forward Yoshinori Muto has also been completed.Against that Mikel Merino has joined Real Sociedad for £10m, Aleksandar Mitrovic was sold to Fulham for £22m, Chancel Mbemba made an £8m move to Porto and Matz Sels headed to Strasbourg for £3.5m.Benítez remains adamant a team vastly improved by the arrival of Dubravka and Kenedy on loan last January requires further reinforcement. Strengthening at centre-half seems a priority with Florian Lejeune now sidelined for most of the season with a serious knee injury.As if Benítez’s mood was not already gloomy enough he is disappointed to have lost his key ally and press officer, Wendy Taylor, to the FA, where she will work with Phil Neville’s Lionesses. Meanwhile Peter Beardsley, Newcastle’s Under-23 coach has now been suspended since January while the club conduct a seemingly interminable investigation into bullying and racism claims, which he denies. The sense of stasis is both unfortunate and serves as a microcosm of the club’s wider woes.Given that his team’s first five Premier League fixtures – Tottenham at home, Cardiff away, Chelsea at home, Manchester City away and Arsenal at home – are somewhat brutal, Benítez’s fears appear anything but overblown. Jonjo Shelvey is capable of lifting the team to a different level but the playmaker needs help not to mention high-calibre strikers to aim those Hoddle-esque passes at.One problem is that Ashley prefers to sign players aged 26 and under as they generally possess greater resale potential. He sees experience as overly expensive and was duly reluctant to pay hard cash for Rondón, who is nearly 29.It all creates an overwhelming sense of an opportunity wasted. With their imposing city centre home invariably packed to 52,000-plus capacity, Newcastle should arguably be competing in Europe almost every season but, paradoxically, their fanbase’s apparently unconditional love for the club is a weakness as well as a strength.During the past decade there have been a number of pressure groups and organised protests against Ashley’s regime - the latest if #ifRafaGoesWeGo – but they have barely raised a scratch on one of the thickest skins in football.The owner might take notice were crowds to drop but Newcastle fans are both intensely loyal to the team and considerably less militant than often advertised. Things might change if Benítez quits but, significantly, the branch of Sports Direct sited on Northumberland Street, one of the city’s main shopping thoroughfares, continues to thrive.In an ideal world Ashley would sell Newcastle for £400m but buyers remain elusive – at least at that price – and Amanda Staveley’s much mooted bid for the club last season ultimately came to nothing.If it is not impossible that Tyneside could wake up one morning to learn that the club has been taken over by a new rich owner – as Manchester City have proved the most significant buy-outs tend to occur amid utter discretion – but it is also quite likely that the current regime will outlast Benítez at St James’."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51ef7827d0e8d29fb3c83d3132a0828b95309eb8/0_213_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e73027ba6cd49f80b637bcdc9fa612e","title":"world cup winners whose age was lower than their shirt number","story":"Plus: playing for England and England C, bumper reserve-fixture crowds and more late transfers changes of heart“If Lucas Hernández was born a year and a half later, his age would be lower than his shirt number (21). Have any World Cup winners achieved this?” muses Edward Gibson.Squad numbers were introduced in 1954, and since then we’ve had three World Cup winners who’ve been younger than their squad numbers, advises Mark van Dijk: In 1970, Brazil’s Emerson Leão was 20 years old and wore No 22. In 1994 Brazil’s Ronaldo was 17 and wore No 20 and in 2002 Brazil’s Kaká was 20 and wore No 23. Also worthy of note are Brazil’s Zé Maria and France’s David Trezeguet who, in 1970 and 1998 respectively, wore their age on the back of their shirt 21 in the case of Zé Maria and 20 in the case of Trezeguet. “Another close call is Shkodran Mustafi, aged 22 and wearing No 21 in 2014,” writes Robert Hickman. But Hernández is the closest to achieving this having played in the final itself, with only Alberto Tarantini (22 and a half wearing No 20 in 1978) and Mario Götze (Just turned 22 and wearing No19 in 2014) in close competition.Meanwhile, Chris Charlton notes that in the 2011 Women’s World Cup final, Japan’s Mawa Iwabuchi came off the bench in the final minute of extra-time, aged 18, wearing shirt number 20. She did not take a penalty, but her side did win on penalties, beating USA 3-1 to settle a 2-2 draw. “David Stockdale got called up to the England squad in 2011, although he never got a game,” tweets Owen Collins. “Would he have become the first player to play for both England and the England C team – or has it been done before?”Pete Tomlin can answer that! “There have been two footballers who have played for both England and England C,” he teaches. “The first was former Leicester City and Arsenal striker Alan Smith. I can’t find any details of his appearance(s) for England C, but the Alvechurch FC website confirms that he did represent them. This would have been in 1981 or 1982 before he moved to Filbert Street, and as well as winning 14 caps for the full England team, he also represented England B on four occasions.The second player to achieve the feat was Steve Guppy. He appeared for England C (then known as England Semi-Pro) in 1993 while he was at Wycombe Wanderers. Guppy is the only player to have represented England, England B (one cap), England C and England U21 (1 cap).Otherwise, there are a number of other players who have represented England C followed by their national side: Junior Agogo (Nigeria), Kevin Betsy (Seychelles), George Boyd (Scotland), Ken Charlery (St Lucia), Danny Collins (Wales), James Comley (Montserrat), Clayton Donaldson (Jamaica), Barry Hayles (Jamaica), Steve Jones (Northern Ireland), Craig Mackail-Smith (Scotland), Steve Morison (Wales), Eamonn O’Keefe (Republic of Ireland), Reece Styche (Gibraltar), Andy Yiadom (Ghana).Finally, there are two others who have sort of represented England C and England: Danny Alcock played for Team GBR at the 2011 World Universiade (aka the World Student Games) and Alex Rodman played for the England Futsal team from 2005-2007 and was also a member of the English \u0026amp British Universities squad when he was a student.”Missing from that list is Sam Ricketts who, notes Chris Williams, played four times for England C before winning 52 caps for Wales. It seems we forgot another high-profile Scottish forward from our list of players who had a late change of heart on their transfer destination.“I’m sure you are forgetting Mo Johnston on his return from France to Scotland,” emails David Sutherland, “who stated that ‘there is no other British club I could play for apart from Celtic’. He was paraded in a Celtic shirt, had signed a pre-contract agreement, and was all set for a return to Parkhead. Things are a bit misty on why he didn’t sign, but joining Rangers, Celtic’s bitter rivals, angered many fans of both clubs.” “I was wondering,” wrote Robert Sleigh in 2010, “what was the highest ever attendance at a reserve game?” OK, so who’s going to start the bidding? 15,000 anybody? 10,000? No? What about 8,559? “Back in 1982 Gillingham drew Spurs at home in the League Cup third round,” writes James Tong. “Knowing that this was a money spinner, the club decided to sell the terrace tickets through the turnstiles at an evening reserve match. Orient were the visitors, and Gills beat them 3-1 in front of a club record crowd for a reserve match of 8,559.”Unfortunately for Gills fans, though, the Priestfield Stadium cannot lay claim to the record. There were 33,800 at Ibrox on 30 August 1997 to watch Rangers’ second string take on Celtic following the cancellation of the first-team Old Firm clash due to the death of Princess Diana. The presence of Antti Niemi, Stuart McCall, Gordan Petric, Tony Vidmar, Barry Ferguson, Gennaro Gattuso, Jonatan Johansson, Ian Durrant and Jörg Albertz in the Rangers line-up probably helped swell the numbers (although they were held to a 1-1 draw by a Bhoys side comprising 11 teenagers).That figure narrowly eclipses Sunderland’s 33,517 for their 1-0 win over Liverpool reserves in January 1999. There was free entry and £7,000 raised for charity. Michael Proctor (remember him?) scored the only goal of the game, while Liverpool’s Brad Friedel saved a penalty.And since then the Knowledge has unearthed this picture of Arsenal reserves versus Chelsea reserves at Highbury in 1948. We’re not sure what the attendance is but Highbury looks full - and a few years later, in 1951, a crowd of 72,408 packed into the ground to watch an FA Cup fourth-round tie against Northampton.• For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the archive.“What is the hottest English league or cup game on record?” asks Mike Dunn.“The Washington Valor arena football team just won their league’s championship, having finished bottom of the table with a 2-12 record but still qualifying for the end-of-season play-offs in which they triumphed,” writes Kyle Hill. “Their final record was 4-13. In that spirit, what’s the worst football club to ever end up as champions (or just promoted)?”“This week Sydney Swans AFL player Alex Johnson will play his first game since 2012,” notes Graham Clayton. “He has missed nearly six seasons due to five knee reconstructions.

It may seem an odd thing to say given they have lost their captain, John Egan, and winger Florian Jozefzoon, to Championship competitors this summer but few clubs navigate transfer windows better than Brentford. They do not panic but rather rebuild and, once more, Dean Smith’s stimulating side – top of the tree after a thumping 5-1 opening-day win – have plans of surprising the field.They are comfortable in their own shell, happy at being different from the rest, visionaries of sorts. Brentford cross-reference potential signings through owner Matthew Benham’s statistical-analysis company, SmartOdds and ditched their £2m-a-year academy two years ago. This pre-season the manager, Smith, scrapped the captaincy altogether – long before the £4m sale of skipper Egan to Sheffield United – preferring a leadership group. Smith is intrigued by rugby, particularly the freedom for players to get involved in the tactics of the game. He has gleaned titbits from visits from the French Rugby Federation and London Irish, while he has an invitation to watch Eddie Jones’s England team.“I think we’re not afraid to break the mould,” Smith, who exited Walsall for Brentford in 2015, says. “I’m not sure the model of having one captain fits within football now. Sometimes when you have a captain you end up with more followers than leaders, and we want to create leaders. I like the way they think in rugby and I think that’s something we can learn from as well. We work on set-pieces in football and the players are struggling at times to remember 12 different routines but in rugby you can have 120 different lineout calls and they’re expected to remember them.”A hybrid of intrinsic planning, forensic scouting and sage spending is fundamental to their recruitment, headed by the technical director Robert Rowan, in tandem with the co-directors, Rasmus Ankersen, also the chairman of FC Midtjylland, the Danish club owned by Benham, and Phil Giles, a maths graduate with a PhD in statistics. Brentford buy not only by numbers but personality they do their homework, extensive due-diligence and referencing.They are scavenged for their best players season-on-season but, successfully replenish their squad in a similar way in which Southampton, in the Premier League, and Peterborough United, in League One, have done so they invest in potential, create value and, more often than not, sell for a healthy profit. When top-scorer Clayton Donaldson left for Birmingham City in the summer of 2014, they signed Andre Gray for £500,000 and Scott Hogan for £750,000 – players they sold for £9m and £12m respectively in 2015 and 2017. Two years ago, they sold future England defender James Tarkowski to Burnley. Sometimes it is a roulette of calculated risks last summer, the sales of Harlee Dean, Maxime Colin and Jota – who left for a total of almost £12m – were countered by the arrivals of £1.8m Ollie Watkins, £1.6m Neal Maupay and Kamohelo Mokotjo, for £880,000. The list goes on and on – in total it is estimated they have made a profit of £50m by selling 11 players since 2014. This summer, Ezri Konsa, the England Under-21 defender, replaced Egan, while Julian Jeanvier arrives from Ligue 2 champions Reims.Brentford are not naïve, they know if a bigger fish comes calling for Chris Mepham, the Wales international and a graduate of the B team that replaced their academy side, or Watkins, they could be blown out of the water. Bournemouth admire both, Leicester City particularly the former, while Ryan Woods, a £1m buy from Shrewsbury Town in 2015, will likely leave for seven times that amount if Swansea City meet his valuation. “There has to be a balancing act, we cannot keep selling our best players all of the time and we have to stand firm sometimes at what can be head-turning finances for some of our players,” Smith says.A slow start hindered Brentford last season – they did not register a league win until 23 September – but they went on to secure a fourth consecutive top-10 finish since promotion in 2014. For a team that have quietly unearthed tomorrow’s stars, on the pitch, Brentford are making a case to be heard. Now, in their last full season at their 104-year-old Griffin Park home (famously a stadium with a pub in each corner), there is an explicit ambition to take the next step, with an opening-day trouncing of Rotherham United setting the bar high for the remainder of the season, including Saturday’s trip to the Potteries.• Sheffield Wednesday are working with the EFL to lift their transfer embargo. Joey Pelupessy, the Dutch midfielder, has been Jos Luhukay’s only signing since his appointment in January. Owner, Dejphon Chansiri, said: “Some people, maybe more, say I spend not wisely on players which I disagree.”• Nigel Adkins eats, sleeps and breathes positivity but there is no hiding from the disenchantment among Hull City supporters. A crowd of just over 14,000, a number which includes Aston Villa’s travelling contingent of more than 2,000, witnessed their 3-1 home defeat on Monday – their smallest opening home gate since moving to the KCOM Stadium in 2003.• Ninety-four minutes into their new season, Blackpool are manager-less after Gary Bowyer quit. The 47-year-old departed two days after an opening-day 0-0 draw, having grown tired of economic frailties, including the sales of key players and a situation whereby he paid for training facilities in Preston out of his own pocket before being reimbursed by the club.• Having retained Christian Doidge, Forest Green Rovers are feeling optimistic. Manager Mark Cooper stressed the importance of staying grounded after a 4-1 win over Grimsby but their hopes are plain for all to see they have three stars emblazoned on the back of this season’s shirts, one to commemorate promotion to the Football League last year, and the other two to “represent the chairman Dale Vince’s ambition to reach the Championship in the coming seasons”.• Brandon Barker has joined Preston on a season-long loan from Manchester City.

Ings has attracted interest from several Premier League clubs this summer having reluctantly accepted he should leave Anfield for regular first team football after an injury-plagued few years. Newcastle United and Crystal Palace are possible destinations for the striker, who was also wanted by former club Burnley before they switched their attentions to signing Matej Vydra from Derby County. Liverpool want £20m for the 26-year-old. Liverpool have received several loan enquiries for Ojo, their talented 21-year-old winger, with Aston Villa keen to take him to the Championship. The Anfield club would prefer a permanent deal, however, and West Bromwich Albion are interested. As for other would-be departures such as Simon Mignolet, Divock Origi and Lazar Markovic, they all have suitors in Europe and, as such, have until the end of the month to finalise transfers.Jérôme Boateng has been on the blower, to let down Mr Mourinho gently and inform the Portuguese that he will not be swapping the Oberpollinger for the Trafford Centre:Done deal klaxon! Adama Traoré joins Wolves on a whopping five-year deal after the club activated his £18m release clause at Middlesbrough. The 22-year-old speeding winger, once of Aston Villa, graduated through the Barcelona academy and becomes Nuno’s fifth summer signing following promotion to the Premier League. Meanwhile, there are a few murmurs that Wolves that five may become six, with Sam Clucas reportedly of interest. The Swansea City midfielder failed to agree terms on a move to Burnley but is said to be a target, with Brentford midfielder Ryan Woods still keen on a move to south Wales.It may have got lost amid the noise around the big-boys, but Bournemouth shattered their transfer record last night, signing the Colombia midfielder Jefferson Lerma for a club-record £25m fee. Eddie Howe’s No 1 summer target, a player the club had tracked long before his World Cup appearances in Russia, has signed contract until 2023 on the south coast. That £25m eclipses the £20m they shelled out for Nathan Aké, last summer. In 2013, their transfer record stood at just £2.5m, when they signed striker Tokelo Rantie from Swedish club Malmo. Want another crunching dose of context? Lerma arrives 10 years to the day that Bournemouth were handed a 17-point deduction in the fourth tier of English football ...Lyon sound far from certain they will retain their captain, Nabil Fekir, this month. The attacking midfielder, who had come close to a £53m switch to Merseyside in June, returned to training on Monday after an extended post-World Cup break and was not included in his club’s travelling squad for Tuesday’s friendly at Chelsea. “For the moment, it’s too early to say whether he will stay,” said the Lyon manager, Bruno Génésio. “He wanted to leave at the end of last season, but he came back on Monday and was happy to come back. “Who knows? There may be opportunities that come up before the end of the window but, for now, he is a Lyon player.” Any other takers?A big dollop of Chelsea news to get us started ... with Kepa Arrizabalaga en route to London to finalise a £71.6m move – a world-record fee for a goalkeeper – to Stamford Bridge. Mateo Kovacic is also expected in the capital ahead of sealing a season-long loan move from Real Madrid, Dominic Fifield reports:Kepa Arrizabalaga and Mateo Kovacic are travelling to London today to complete their respective moves to Chelsea, deals that are likely to conclude the Premier League club’s incoming business ahead of Thursday’s cut-off. The goalkeeper will cost £71.6m from Athletic Bilbao, having made that payment at 9.22am Spanish time to trigger his buy-out clause in Madrid (apparently the player has to meet the fee in Spain, with the buying club presumably providing him with the required funds) before flying to England.The end is near, this very nearly the final descent. Who will be sitting pretty come 5pm on Thursday? Who will be tearing their hair out, resigned to their fate? Will Athletic Bilbao’s Kepa Arrizabalaga become Chelsea’s Kepa Arrizabalaga?

Yet non-coeliac gluten sensitivity appears to be a modern condition. While the notion that some forms of gluten could be a potential source of the digestive difficulties, growing numbers of people report suffering has circulated in complementary medicine circles for decades, the gluten avoidance trend has really taken off in the past decade. When Miley Cyrus went public about her “gluten allergy” in 2012 and, in 2013, Gwyneth Paltrow published a gluten-free recipe book, the standard bearers for the anti-gluten movement were born.It is noticeable that gluten sensitivity seems to preoccupy women more than men, which instantly locates it on gendered territory where it can be dismissed, like a Victorian diagnosis of “hysteria”, as an imaginary malady of attention-seeking, fashion-conscious, mainly younger women. Statistically, women are more likely than men to be gluten sensitive: two to three times as many women as men suffer from coeliac disease, going up to six times more for non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.Gluten-free diets yield mixed results. One woman I spoke to, who described her symptoms as her stomach “blowing up like a balloon”, gave me this verdict on her experiment. “I lived above a bakery in Paris. Three months of gluten-free torture and denial, but it didn’t work.” But others do see a benefit. In one recent study, researchers concluded: “Participants’ reasons for gluten avoidance in the absence of a medical diagnosis of coeliac disease were, for the most part, reasoned and logical. The vast majority of participants believed that adhering to a gluten-free diet led to improvements.”Even so, we are still encouraged to file the non-coeliac gluten-free regime in the dustbin of baseless celebrity fad diets, to write it off as a 21st-century exercise in mass neurosis. After all, why should grains that we have been eating, apparently without incident, for as long as 14,000 years suddenly become too hard to stomach? Maybe we need to rephrase that question: what is it about the grain-based staples that most of us are eating, that could be causing population-wide digestive difficulties? Or, as the Real Bread Campaign co-founder, Andrew Whitley, says: “We should be asking why the food system has done this to us, asking how it dares to sell us crap that’s made us like this”.What does he mean? For a start, the wheat we are eating has been bred, largely at the behest of industrial bakeries and food manufacturers, to have higher levels of stronger gluten. (The more gluten, the fluffier and more voluminous your loaf.) In the UK, the oldest modern bread wheat cultivar we grow is Maris Widgeon, which dates back to 1964 the rest were developed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries for higher yield and higher gluten. These cultivars are not what our ancestors ate. What other unintended mutations might this breeding have caused in these varieties, and what effects might they have on the people who eat them?Our great-grandparents’ grain was not sprayed with pesticides, either. These days, it is common practice among non-organic farmers to spray their wheat on days before harvest with the controversial pesticide glyphosate, to dry off the crop for processing. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies it as a probable human carcinogen. Debate rages about the long-term safety of these pesticides and possible effects on human health, especially when deployed so close to harvesting.In the factory, heavily automated bakery conglomerates have stripped out most of the time, human effort and craftsmanship from the bread-making process, replacing traditional methods with a chemistry set of additives and undisclosed processing aids, notably enzymes synthesised in the laboratory. These enzymes, and the 27 potential allergens that scientists have identified in wheat, are now firmly in the frame for causing “baker’s lung”, an occupational hazard of bakery factory workers. Could they also be affecting the health of their customers in a less dramatic manner? Although all the additives used to make modern bread and processed food products are “generally recognised as safe”, in the circumspect language of the US Food and Drug Administration, some researchers have associated a number of food additives with some of the gut alterations seen in both coeliac and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, as well as in inflammatory bowel disease. For instance, one study found that emulsifiers, a common category of food additive found in industrial breads and baked goods, may promote intestinal inflammation by disrupting the barrier between the immune system and the microbiome – the collection of microbes that inhabit our bodies. The cumulative cocktail effect of modern combinations of additives we eat could also be cause for concern, as the safety of each is only tested in isolation and any possible cocktail effect has not been systematically studied.For the past 20-30 years, industrial bakeries have also been adding extra gluten to their products, known as “vital gluten” in the trade, but often labelled innocuously as “wheat protein”. Consumers are eating more gluten now than ever before. And, in a belt-and-braces strategy to make their goods look as big and as good-value as possible, they have also bumped up the amount of yeast (another known food allergen) in their formulations.Today’s industrial baked goods sound even less like a recipe for digestive comfort when you consider that the most crucial step in traditional bread making – long, slow fermentation – has been stripped largely out of the industrial manufacturing process, making it possible to create finished loaves in two hours, as opposed to the traditional time frame of 16 hours or more. Some experts argue that without this traditional fermentation – the process by which parts of the grain begin to be broken down in the presence of lactic acid bacteria – many people simply can’t digest grains properly to absorb the desirable micronutrients they contain. “We hear time and again from people who have found they can eat one type of loaf but not another,” says Chris Young of the Real Bread Campaign. “Some people report their trouble is triggered by contemporary strains of modern wheat, while real bread made with heritage varieties are fine. Or perhaps they are limited to eating ancient types of wheat like einkorn, emmer or spelt. Other people have found that the only bread they can enjoy is genuine sourdough, made by a long fermentation process using a live starter sourdough culture.”So, while gluten need not be a digestive disruptor, per se, it could perhaps become so when encountered in its inadequately fermented forms, particularly when it is mixed with pesticide residues, food additives and processing aids that could be troublemakers in their own right. Other possible triggers for gastric difficulties could be Fodmaps, or Fermentable, Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides and Polyols. These sugars are by no means exclusive to gluten-containing foods, but they are naturally rich in them. The thinking here is that it is not necessarily gluten, but badly absorbed Fodmaps that generate symptoms similar to those observed in gluten sensitivity. A Fodmaps diet involves cutting out high Fodmap foods for six to eight weeks before reintroducing them one-by-one, over time, to pin down the culprit(s). The verdict? “Very difficult to do. I don’t know anyone who has stuck to it,” was the anecdotal response I got from one person who tried this.And what about fibre, which is enshrined in government healthy eating guidelines? We are exhorted to eat products made from whole grains, such as those with lots of wheat bran, rather than white refined ones, but, without thorough fermentation to break down whole grains into a digestible form, might the insoluble fibre in such products inflame our guts? A recent scientific review of the effects of dietary fibre on those who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome noted that: “A general recommendation to increase fibre intake in this group of patients would be inappropriate since it could worsen the symptoms.” Yet most of us still assume, because we have been told over and over again, that “brown is best”.People dogged by the spectrum of symptoms labelled as a gluten intolerance turn hopefully, or in desperation, to the burgeoning, highly lucrative larder of gluten-free alternatives that manufacturers have put on our shelves. But relying on gluten-free alternatives could be counterproductive. The vast majority of gluten-free creations touted as “tummy friendly” contain the same questionable enzymes and additives that food technologists use in the standard, gluten-containing industrial equivalent. In addition, they also rely on hi-tech food manufacturing ingredients to provide their architecture. These include xanthan gum, a strong, glue-like substance also used in the oil industry to thicken drilling mud, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, also used in the construction industry for its water-retaining properties in cement, and tapioca starch, a nutritionally depleted, chemically modified starch from the cassava root. Are these items in many gluten-free products a boon for under-par guts, or a prescription for swapping diarrhoea for constipation?The habits of a relatively small number of extreme eaters are one thing, but attempts by many more people to tackle their weight or gastric issues by seeing if they do better on a gluten-free regime, are quite another. And behind them sits an even bigger debate. If an excess of sugar and carbohydrate foods is the real driver of obesity, as is increasingly hypothesised, then all those people cutting out gluten-containing carbs as a sort of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey exercise in tackling spreading thighs and bulging bellies may not be too wide of the mark.Given the troubled state of the nation’s guts and the girth of its waist, our fixation on gluten is unlikely to disappear any time soon, although a rival food fashion trend could be its nemesis. Google searches for “plant-based diet” spiked over the past year, while searches for “gluten-free diet” have gradually declined since a 2012 peak.There is a conflict here. Mapping out a realistic, workable diet free from gluten – or, indeed, Fodmaps – yet big on plants is nothing if not challenging. If, that is, you want to eat a real-food diet and stay as far away from ultra-processed junk as possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26a6c7d916a625bafc99a8f467a48481bef921b4/0_111_3888_2331/master/3888.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7aa95fd9d7c5e7f54f4c87aecfc6ddfb","title":"mcdonalds happy meal healthy advert children asa","story":"ASA rejects complaint against fast-food firm but bans ads for KFC and Kellogg’s Coco PopsThe UK advertising watchdog has ruled that McDonald’s Happy Meals can be advertised during children’s TV shows because they are “healthy”, but banned ads for KFC and Kellogg’s Coco Pops for promoting junk food to young people.McDonald’s has strived to improve the nutritional value of Happy Meals by making cheeseburgers available only on request, reducing the serving size of fries that come with Chicken McNuggets and cutting the sugar in chocolate milk, but health campaigners still see the home of the Big Mac as the frontline in the fight against junk food advertising.The Advertising Standards Authority dismissed a complaint that a Pokémon-themed Happy Meal ad, which featured products including Chicken McNuggets, should not have been allowed to run between episodes of Peppa Pig.Under UK rules, children cannot be targeted with adverts for products that are high in fat, salt and sugar, and licensed characters should not be used to promote such products to them.While customers can order products such as cheeseburgers, Coca-Cola and milkshakes with Happy Meals, McDonald’s does not feature them in its advertising, so it can comply with UK laws regarding targeting junk food ads at children. The company said it had not advertised that cheeseburgers are part of the Happy Meal range for more than a decade in the UK.A spokeswoman for McDonald’s defended its advertising strategy. “We comply and go beyond the UK’s stringent regulations on marketing to children and use our marketing to help families understand more about the range of food options we offer,” she said.While McDonald’s avoided a ban, the ASA ruled that a Kellogg’s Coco Pops ad for a granola product, which appeared between episodes of the Mr Bean cartoon, broke the UK advertising code. While the ASA deemed that the granola product itself was not junk food, the wider content of the ad broke UK law.The advert featured the Coco Pops monkey and focused on making the cereal “chocolatey” – a hallmark of the wider Coco Pops range, which is deemed to be too sugary to market to children – and not enough on the healthier granola. The ASA banned the ad.Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, which lodged the Coco Pops complaint, said: “This is just another example of the ever-evolving tricks brands use to get their products in front of children, and why we need stronger regulatory protection online and a 9pm watershed on junk food adverts on TV.”The watchdog also banned a poster for KFC’s Mars Krushems drink for appearing on a phone box near the entrance to a primary school, which is not allowed. KFC said the ad was placed there in error.Later this year the government is launching a consultation on junk food marketing restrictions in an attempt to tackle the growing childhood obesity problem.The consultation will look at measures including two-for-one junk food deals and the sale of sweets and chocolates around supermarket checkouts, as well as the potential for a pre-9pm ban on junk food ads.Barbara Crowther, the coordinator of the Children’s Food Campaign, said: “Clear guidance about what constitutes a HFSS advert and a stronger legislative framework to restrict junk food marketing are needed if we are to adequately protect children from obesity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bbe1a9321f40b51a7a473cb271fe27a4f732eb8/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4efd3da96923a2424415eb8d30e0b51","title":"booking com overbooked refund out of pocket","story":"I booked rooms in a hotel in Antalya, Turkey through Booking and confirmed that a 2am check-in would not be a problem.When I arrived with my elderly father and two young daughters the hotel was overbooked.

Gerry Adams, the former president of Sinn Féin and a veteran Irish republican, has revealed he is writing a cookery book.The book, which is being teed up for the Christmas market, will contain recipes with “some of the best-kept secrets” of the 1998 peace process, he said.Adams gave details of his latest venture at a talk in Belfast, tweeting what appeared to be the front cover of the book, entitled The Negotiator’s Cookbook.The revelation cooked up a storm on social media, with suggested recipe titles including “the peas process”, “pizza in our time”, “Mary Lou’s Irish stew” and “Cookie Ár Lá” – a reference to the Irish republican phrase Tiocfaidh ár lá, meaning “our day will come”.However, others voiced incredulity at Adams’ decision to publish something so seemingly frivolous when there were still so many questions about deaths during the Troubles.His co-authors Ted Howell and Padraic Wilson are fellow republicans.

He succeeded his father as MP for the constituency in 2010 and has said he would stand in a byelection if one is called. Given that his majority is more than 20,000, some might consider it unlikely that he would lose any subsequent byelection.A report by the Commons standards committee found Paisley’s actions “were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute”, after it emerged that he had breached the rules on paid advocacy.After he received the holidays from Sri Lanka’s government, he wrote to David Cameron on 19 March 2014 to lobby against supporting a UN resolution on human rights abuses there.He also breached rules by failing to declare the personal benefit in his letter to the prime minister, and on the register of interests.Under the 2015 Recall of MPs Act, which came into effect in 2016, MPs who are convicted of a criminal offence and jailed, barred from the Commons for 10 sitting days or convicted of providing false information on allowance claims can lose their seat if there is a successful petition to recall them.Last week, the Sinn Féin Northern Ireland assembly member Philip McGuigan said he had written to the electoral office to demand it puts in place the maximum number of voting centres and introduces more flexible voting times.“The decision by the electoral office to locate petitions in only three locations in a large rural constituency like North Antrim is extremely disappointing and greatly reduces people’s ability to reject Ian Paisley’s disgraceful behaviour,” he said.“Some people will have to travel up to 20-25 miles to vote in one of these three centres, and those who work outside of the constituency won’t have time to vote outside of working hours.”McGuigan said the number of voting centres for the Paisley petition was significantly lower than for the 2017 general election, when there were 94 ballot across 49 locations.He said some people would feel uncomfortable signing the petition at the Ballymoney centre in County Antrim because of the area’s strong unionist influence.

However, women can elect to freeze their eggs privately for non-medical reasons. Currently the standard for elected freezing is that eggs can be stored for a maximum of 10 years.“While women should be supported in their choices, they must be informed about the relatively low success rates, high costs and side effects associated with egg freezing and IVF treatment,” said Adam Balen, professor of reproductive medicine and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG).“If a woman does decide to freeze her eggs for social reasons, she should have counselling with a reproductive specialist and choose a clinic that has plenty of experience. The clinic should provide a realistic idea of potential success related to her age. Evidence suggests that the best time to freeze eggs is in a woman’s early twenties and certainly under the age of 37 years old,” Balen added.“Success rates for egg freezing have improved significantly in recent years so offer an opportunity for women to freeze their eggs for social reasons if they’re not ready to have children yet,” Balen said. “However, it must be stressed that egg freezing does not guarantee a baby in the future.”In two articles published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, experts expressed arguments for and against the idea that “social egg freezing should be offered to single women approaching their late thirties”.Among the supportive arguments, experts from Imperial College London and the Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health noted that improvements in egg freezing technologies mean a far better chance of egg survival now.However, the second group of experts, from Imperial College London and Chelsea and Westminster hospital, said that women in their late thirties face higher costs – due to the need for more eggs than at a younger age – and that having a baby later in life was linked to a higher risk of complications in pregnancy.Stuart Lavery, consultant gynaecologist and director of IVF at Hammersmith hospital, told the  that permission to store frozen eggs needed to be extended beyond 10 years.Currently, women are caught between having eggs stored during a period where they still have good fertility but the storage time limit might expire before they want to use the eggs, and waiting until later to store them – when their eggs might be of poorer quality – but the possibility of having a child is extended further.Lavery said the decision of women to freeze their eggs for non-medical reasons, including because they have not yet met a partner with whom they wish to raise a child, should not be termed “social egg freezing”.“The term social egg freezing I think is too pejorative. I think people really get very judgemental about it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/792d71d1f3dffca9ae53406f269b1ba90be6fefe/0_2_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8e12c85475c7a3203a6e2a068e823ce","title":"paul gray universal credit ministers wrong ignore committee","story":"After eight years of difficulty and controversy, universal credit may well be about to move into an even more fraught phase, suggests Paul Gray, who has just stepped down after six years as chair of the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP) social security advisory committee (SSAC).Up to 3 million people will start to be “migrated” on to the new benefit system next year. And Gray, who as a senior civil servant was closely involved in the rollout of tax credits under a Labour government, says the potential operational and political risks for universal credit (UC) are huge: “This is where it gets really serious.”If ministers do not heed the lessons of the past few years, the migration process, he reckons, could trigger more strife. As well as the sheer numbers moving on to the new system, they include working people on tax credits who will have to adapt very quickly to a complex and, for many people, less generous new system – and if they don’t, they will face penalties.The mental health charity Mind has already flagged up its concerns that many vulnerable claimants will fall though the net, leaving them without income. Gray says this is a fair observation. Ministers must ensure that proper help for all claimants is in place, properly funded. The current universal support arrangements may not be enough. “My sense is that the jury is still out on whether that is satisfactorily in place, sufficient and effective in different parts of the country.” Yet, for all this, he is optimistic about UC: “I think it is the right broad direction of travel. Frankly, if it needs to take a bit longer, beyond 2023, is that the end of the world? No, I don’t think it is. The important thing is to get to a point where it is working.”Gray gives credit to former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith for his ambition, but the idea that this would be up and running within a single parliament was, he says, “with the benefit of hindsight and possibly foresight too, never going to be doable”.Was there – in the words of the public accounts committee – a “culture of indifference” in the DWP? Gray says it was more, perhaps a “mistaken sense of self-sufficiency”. It must listen more to external voices, to service users and its own frontline. Senior DWP officials, he noted, had been striving in recent years to encourage staff to “speak truth to power”, he says. “Clearly, they haven’t been wholly successful. There is a cultural problem they need to tackle.”In 2014, the SSAC carried out a major consultation on ministers’ proposals to introduce a seven-day waiting period before a claim for benefits could be made. It said that would seriously affect vulnerable claimants – who would have to wait at least six weeks to receive any money – and public expenditure savings would be illusory. Don’t do it, the committee advised. Ministers ignored it, only to scrap the policy four years later, when its malign effects became obvious.He hopes ministers will listen more carefully to the SSAC in future: “We are raising issues of genuine concern. Wouldn’t it be better for everybody if more notice was taken up front, which avoids the need for people to go through unnecessary pain … and frankly the government could save itself a headache.”Family: Married two sons and two grandchildren.Education: Wyggeston Boys’ School, Leicester London School of Economics, BSc economics.Career: 2008-present: executive coach to public and private sector leaders 1969-77 and 1979-2007: UK civil service (senior roles included 2006-07: executive chair and permanent secretary, HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs 2004-06: deputy chairman, HMRC 2002-04: second permanent secretary, Department for Work and Pensions.

The scheme is similar to a model encouraging businesses to offer free water refills to non-customers. The Refill campaign aims to break the stigma around asking for water for free even if customers have not purchased anything else.Some areas – including Bolsover, Milton Keynes, Redditch and Wakefield – are without a single free public toilet. The BTA said this could be a challenge for many, particularly older people, families with small children and people with medical conditions.A spokesperson for the Local Government Association said: “Councils are doing everything they can to keep public toilets open and ensure there is provision for people with particular needs.

There has also been a substantial increase in demand for depression and anxiety medications in recent years – on both sides of the Atlantic. According to Zion Market Research, the “general anxiety disorder market” is undergoing rapid growth and is expected to generate revenue of $3.7bn by the end of 2020 in the US. Meanwhile, the UK has become the world’s second-largest market, after the US, of illegal online sales of the anti-anxiety medication Xanax.We can blame some of our current angst on the tempestuous US president. “Trump anxiety disorder” is not an official disease, but therapists have started using the term. The clinical psychologist Jennifer Panning coined the phrase in a 2017 essay and the CBC, Canada’s public broadcasting company, recently ran a piece on the phenomenon, describing how American mental-health professionals are reporting “unusually high levels of politics-related stress in their practices.” Nicely trolled, Canada. Nicely trolled. Meanwhile, to throw a little personal anecdata into the mix, my New York doctor told me he saw a spike in patients asking for sleeping pills after Trump was elected.Now, I’m sorry to say this, but we can’t blame Trump for everything that’s wrong in the world – or in our psyches. We are in the grip of an anxiety epidemic that predates his presidency. Indeed, we have become so collectively consternated that a 2016 analysis led by the World Health Organisation estimated that, without more treatment, 12bn working days will be lost because of anxiety each year. The study estimated the cost to the global economy up to 2030 at $925bn.It is jarring that the study framed anxiety as a threat to global productivity, because the imperative to be constantly productive is one of the things that makes me acutely anxious. In a capitalist economy, we are prompted to measure our self-worth by our output. We are constantly told that there is nothing better than being busy success means getting up at 5am, punishing ourselves at the gym and then producing, producing, producing. I\u0026nbsphave frequent anxiety attacks where I feel as if I’m not doing enough, achieving enough, earning enough, etc. I have to constantly remind myself that it is important to take time out. In a world which urges constant activity, it’s important to do nothing occasionally.The big lie that the burgeoning anxiety industry sells is that we all, inidually, have the power to fix our problems. That if we buy the right book or take the right pills we will be able to quiet our worries and feel better. It is certainly true that the right books and the right pills can help. But there isn’t enough acknowledgment that the reason we have entered an “age of anxiety” is structural. It would be bizarre if most of us, particularly millennials, weren’t anxious: inequality is skyrocketing, the job market is becoming more precarious and house prices are increasingly out of reach. Add in political instability and there is a lot to worry about. The one thing you shouldn’t worry about, however, is that you are the only one feeling anxious.Using a plastic straw these days is basically akin to walking around with a sign saying: “I love stabbing baby turtles in the nostril.” In today’s anti-straw environment, there is no faster way to demonstrate that you are the sea life-murdering spawn of Satan than sipping your artisanal iced coffee with a single-use piece of plastic.Listen, I know very well that they are evil and unrecyclable, but the inconvenient truth is that plastics straws are great. Sure, they may kill innocent sea turtles, but they don’t turn to mush in your mouth like their paper equivalents, which are an abomination. And please don’t tell me I should just drink with my mouth that’s disgusting.At the risk of sounding like one of those unhinged rightwingers who has developed a bizarre passion for straws in an attempt to “own the libs”, I feel compelled to announce that I find this witch-hunt against straws incredibly irritating. One of my main bugbears is the way it has become a smug form of virtue-signaling. Shunning plastic straws is 2018’s answer to the reusable water bottle, which has become something of a status symbol among young people. There is nothing wrong with showing that you care about the environment, of course – that should be applauded. It’s just that the amount of attention the anti-straw movement has garnered seems disproportionate they are literally a drop in our plastic-filled oceans. Further, getting rid of straws is a convenient way for polluting companies to make themselves look good without really changing or jeopardising their bottom line.But it’s too late for straw-truthers like me. The tide has turned. The anti-straw industrial complex will not be stopped. The only thing one can really do now is suck it up.I recently met a sweet little dachshund in the park. “What’s he called?” I asked the attendant human. “Alan,” the owner said blithely. “Oh, how nice!” I replied.Obviously, I didn’t mean that. It should be illegal to call your dachshund Alan. Not that I have anything against Alans it’s a perfectly good name for a retired footballer. It just isn’t suitable for a cute canine. Dogs should have sensible names such as Rascal and Spot. Ever since my Alan encounter, though, I seem to keep meeting dogs with human names and I’m finding it very unsettling. Call it my pet peeve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d2d78f20e066aacfe002f802c936cf1a33c6f9c/0_1_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=515c2fef7f93efc51f3bc5da5e32eccc","title":"dina asher smith wins 100m euro gold","story":"In a stadium suffused with history, and on a night broiling with heat and high expectations, Dina Asher-Smith and Zharnel Hughes produced performances for the ages to claim double European 100m glory for Britain.First to strike in temperatures that drifted into the mid-30s was Asher-Smith, who smashed her own national record to win gold in 10.85sec – a staggering performance that also made her the first Briton to win this event since Dorothy Hyman, a miner’s daughter from Yorkshire, in 1962.Then, 20 minutes later, two Britons went toe-to-toe in a breathtaking men’s 100m battle with Zharnel Hughes taking the gold medal on the dip to win in 9.95sec – a new championship record – from Reece Prescod.Prescod’s consolation is a silver medal and a new personal best of 9.96. But at one stage, as he loomed on his teammate’s shoulder, he must have sniffed the possibility of even more.That encounter was certainly the race of the evening. But there was no doubting what will linger longest in the memory: the sight of the 22-year-old Asher-Smith powering away from the field to set the fastest 100m time in the world this year.Behind her was the home favourite Gina Lückenkemper, 21, who claimed silver in 10.98 – a new personal best – while the Dutch athlete Dafne Schippers was third 0.01 further back. Britain’s other representative in the final, Imani-Lara Lansiquot, was sixth in 11.14. But they were battling for the minor medals from almost the first stride. “I am so happy,” said Asher-Smith. “To run a 10.8 in the championships is a big deal. I did everything right. I knew I had it in me but anything can happen in finals.“I did everything right. I was so happy to nail it in the final because I know there are so many talented people around me but you have to ignore that.”Last year Asher-Smith finished a history degree at King’s College, London. Now, in the stadium where Jesse Owens defied the Nazis and Usain Bolt set a world 100m record of 9.58sec in 2009, she was determined to create her own.That much was obvious in the way she destroyed Schippers, who had beaten her at every major championship final they had contested since the 2014 Europeans – a run that stretched through the 2015 world championships, the 2016 Olympics and last year’s worlds in London.What made this victory even sweeter was that in 2017 Asher-Smith spent months recovering from a broken foot that made her fear whether she would ever be the same athlete again. She was right in one respect. She is not the same athlete. She is better. Much better.Yet amid the euphoria of this victory there was also an impressively icy calm, with Asher-Smith maintaining that her job in Berlin this week is only a third done. Next up is a rematch with Schippers over 200m before, if all goes well, attempting a third gold in the 4x100m relay at the weekend. No Briton has ever won the sprint treble – a feat last achieved by the East German Katrin Krabbe in 1990 – and Asher-Smith appears determined to change that.“I’m going to let myself enjoy the emotional high but then refocus,” she added. “I have to take the 200m like another championship, it’s a completely clean slate because I’m only one third of the way there.“You don’t know what those girls are going to bring, some of them haven’t run the 100m, so we’ll have to see. But I have said to myself ’I’m here to win, I’m not taking any less.’”Eyes then switched to the men’s 100m and the possibility of the first British 1-2-3 at the Europeans since 1998 when Doug Walker, Doug Turner and Julian Golding claimed all three medals in a modestly run men’s 200m. Those chances seemed to rise sharply when the Frenchman Jimmy Vicaut, who had run a European Championship record of 9.97 in his semi-final, pulled out 30 minutes before the final after feeling a niggle during his warm-up.When the gun went off, Hughes was perhaps quickest away with Prescod and CJ Ujah chasing hard behind. With 30 metres remaining Ujah began to fade, eventually finishing fourth in 10.06 behind the Turk Jack Ali Harvey. But Prescod kept pushing to the line and only just lost out on the dip.“I am happy and the job is done. I felt a bit of cramp so I don’t think I could have gone any faster but I’m just happy,” said Hughes. “Prescod is a fast finisher, so I knew I had to stay relaxed as he would challenge me towards the end. I am happy that we came out victorious.”As he spoke Asher-Smith was already heading to the tunnel, away from the fans who had vigorously cheered her name to tell the world: “I am hoping to do the same thing that I did today in Tokyo!”And after this victory, why not? Today, queen of Europe. Next year and in 2020, the world?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1009c18ce06c4129c275efc8f952ff2b9c4ed4c/0_202_4099_2459/master/4099.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=776d52cd05f57d7888e5886aeb90e88f","title":"talking horses pendo brighton mile","story":"John Best’s improving gelding is a tempting price at 12-1 in the standout race on the first day of the Brighton Festival meetingThe three-day Brighton Festival meeting – or the second leg of Sussex Fortnight if you are an old-timer like me – gets underway on Wednesday afternoon on predictably fast ground given the weather over the past couple of months, and even a concerted programme of watering has only maintained the official going as good-to-firm, firm in places.That is as quick as ground ever tends to get these days, at courses with a watering system at least, and only two of the eight races this afternoon have managed to draw a double-figure field. One of those, though, is the Brighton Mile, the highlight of the first day of the meeting and it is as open a race as an 11-runner handicap is ever likely to be, with the entire field priced up between 4-1 and 20-1.Last year’s winner Lord Clenaghcastle is just 2lb higher today and arrives on the back of a narrow win at Sandown Park last time out. He is a fair price at around 13-2, but a closer look at the form of last year’s race suggests that Pendo (3.10), who was two lengths away in second, is an even better price at around 12-1.John Best’s gelding was not the most reliable of performers in the early part of his career but has improved his strike rate since joining his current stable a couple of years ago and has had only four starts since last year’s Brighton Mile. He is 6lb better off this time around and has probably been trained with today’s race in mind from a long way out.Elsewhere on the card, Solveig’s Song (5.10) could be worth a small interest at around 12-1 to bounce back to form at a track where she recorded two wins in 2016. She is now down to a basement mark of 45, is a winner at Brighton off 55 and 51 and showed her first glimmer of form for a while back at this track earlier in the year.Imbucato (4.10) ran well at Chepstow last time and looks fairly priced at around 100-30, while on the day’s other cards, Reverend Jacobs (3.50) is on the up and will be very difficult to beat at Pontefract. Classic Pursuit (4.20) is another to think about at the same track, while in the final race of the day at Kempton Park, Zaajer (9.10), who was behind two subsequent winners at Lingfield Park last time, should get off the mark at at the fifth attempt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4b1b0c202bb9592143eb4067ad65c6ff44c1f4e/0_0_1616_970/master/1616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a2f801418d10bc2e51395a1dbd7c39b","title":"android 9 pie google new mobile os everything you need to know","story":"Google’s new mobile OS is rolling out to a select group of phones. Here’s the lowdown on the new featuresGoogle’s next version of Android finally has a name: “Pie”. It’s rolling out right now and is packed with new features, from extended battery life to new gesture navigation.Pie marks one of the biggest changes in the way Android looks and feels in some years, with a more colourful interface, a collection of new movement animations and rounded edges on almost everything. Thankfully, it’s still as fast as Android Oreo, at least on Google’s Pixel smartphones.Right now, if you have one of the recent Google Pixel smartphones or the Essential Phone via an over-the-air update. Either wait for the notification to update or head to Settings \u0026gt System \u0026gt Advanced \u0026gt System update and hit the “Check for update” button.Others will have to wait for their smartphone manufacturer to deliver the update. Those with phones such as the OnePlus 6 that were included in the Android P beta programme over the last couple of months will probably see the update soon. Those with Samsung, Huawei or other mainstream manufacturer devices may have to wait some time to see the update on their phones.Android 9 Pie is a free update for eligible devices – if you are ever asked to pay for Android updates, someone is trying to con you.Google has introduced the biggest change to the way you get around in Android since the traditional three buttons of home, back and overview (recently used apps).The new gesture navigation button occupies the same space as the traditional on-screen buttons, but the home button is now a pill-shape and it moves.Tap it to go home, flick it up to see recently used apps, swipe upwards twice or pull it up further to get to the app drawer, or hold it down to activate Google Assistant. Youcan also drag it to the right to switch to the last app (similar to the double tap of the overview button) or drag and hold to cycle through recently used apps.The back button still appears when needed, but the overview button has gone.The gestures are not activated by default for now, which means to try them out head to Settings \u0026gt System \u0026gt Gestures and toggle the “Swipe up on Home button” option.It’s a small change, but arguably the most useful. Now when you have rotation lock turned on to stop the screen rotating orientation accidentally, and you turn on your phone intentionally, a little button appears in the navigation bar.Tap the button to rotate the screen from portrait to landscape or vice versa – perfect for those few times that you actually want the screen to rotate but not, say, when you’re lying down in bed.Android 9 Pie has moved the time from the top right of the status bar to the top left. It may not seem the most dramatic of changes, but it makes room for screen cutouts called “notches”, as found on the OnePlus 6 and Huawei P20 Pro, among others.Google has decreed that only two notches may be used on one screen for it to be able to run its version of Android, so at least you won’t have to deal with one in each side of the screen.Short of navigation gestures, Adaptive Battery is the biggest improvement to Android. Using systems developed by Alphabet’s AI-outfit DeepMind, Adaptive Battery learns an inidual’s usage patterns and directs the power to only the apps you need at the time you need them for more predictable day-to-day battery life.AI has also been integrated into Android Pie’s brightness control, so it will now learn from your manual adjustments – something you could be forgiven for thinking already happened.Smart replies have been in several apps for a while, including Gmail and Google’s dedicated Smart Reply app. But now they’ll be pushed to more apps and accessible directly from the notifications for easy, one-button replies.App actions is another AI-integration attempt by Google, which seeks to predict not only the app that you want at any particular moment, but an action from within that app too. For example, I normally play my Discover Weekly playlist from Spotify in the mornings, so when I open the app drawer at about 8am it’s right there as a suggestion for one-tap access.Apple’s iOS has had a magnifying glass for text selection for ages – now Android does too. Tapping on a bit of text still selects it, but when you drag one of the text selection handles you now see a magnified box appear immediately above your finger to make fine grain selection easier, particularly with tiny text.Google is revamping the way Android handles background apps to better protect user privacy. Starting with Android P, apps given permission for location, the microphone, camera and network status will no longer be able to access them when idle in the background. This means it will be harder for rogue apps to spy on users without their knowledge.The changes follow a recent tightening of control over the running of apps that were made with Android Nougat and Android Oreo, primarily to prolong battery life and performance.While Android 9 Pie has been released, not all the features shown off by Google at its developer conference in May are fully baked yet. Two big new features have yet to arrive: Slices and Google’s Digital Wellbeing tools. Expect them to materialise in the Autumn for Google’s Pixel devices and later for other smartphones.Slices displays information from apps directly within the Google search app, in a similar manner to the way Google displays snippets of information within boxes directly in web search results.Examples include showing photos taken in Bali from Google Photos, when searching for Bali, or live prices and times to get you home from Lyft when searching for the app.Google’s anti-smartphone addiction tools, collectively called “Digital Wellbeing”, are currently in beta testing for a select number of users. They include Dashboard, which shows you how much time you’re spending on your phone and in apps App Timer, which allows you to set time limits for certain apps a beefed up Do Not Disturb (DnD) function that silences both visual and audible alerts and Wind Down, which switches on DnD and fades the screen to grayscale as bedtime approaches.To sign up for the beta on a Google Pixel smartphone running Android 9 Pie, go here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c11a4dceebaee11982192443c466d053fc60e37/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ded815c720dd528d9834e8c3bc475f4","title":"elon musk tesla inc private","story":"Musk tweets plan as it emerges Saudi Arabia has built up $2.9bn stake in tech giantElon Musk has launched a campaign to take Tesla private on a day that included several provocative tweets, a suspension (and resumption) of trading in the company’s shares, reports of a significant Saudi investment, a surge in stock price, and an evocative, Musk-tinged appeal to the Tesla faithful: “The future is very bright and we’ll keep fighting to achieve our mission.”The tweet appeared to be triggered by a report in the Financial Times that Saudi Arabia has built up a stake in Tesla worth up to $2.9bn.In a follow up tweet, Musk wrote: “I don’t have a controlling vote now and wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.”In the letter sent out to Tesla employees, Musk did not say that Tesla had secured funding. He wrote instead that “a final decision has not yet been made, but the reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best”.Musk described the “wild swings” in Tesla’s stock price as a “major distraction” and said the quarterly earnings cycle puts “enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term”.PIF, which manages more than $250bn in assets, reportedly made an overture to Musk earlier this year, offering to invest money in the company in return for new shares.Tesla ignored the approach, prompting PIF to begin acquiring shares in the company through stock markets, with the assistance of JP Morgan.Analyst Gene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, told Bloomberg: “Elon Musk does not want to run public companies. His missions are big and make it difficult to accommodate investors’ quarterly expectations. Our guess is there is a one-in-three chance he can actually pull this off.”No Wall Street bank contacted by CNBC said it was aware of any transaction or had any knowledge of commitment to funding a leveraged buyout of Tesla.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also declined to comment on the matter.The confusion increased speculation that Musk was engaged in a stunt – which could backfire if Musk is found to have violated fiduciary directives governing how senior executives at publicly-held companies are permitted to release information that could affect a firm’s stock price.In 2013, the SEC ruled that companies are allowed to use social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter to announce news. But many thought Musk could be making a pun by twice tweeting “420” – an abbreviation of 420, code for the consumption of cannabis.Musk’s fondness for making statements via Twitter has backfired in the past. He attracted furious criticism after baselessly calling a British er who helped rescue the boys trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand a “pedo”. Tesla’s share price dropped and Musk was forced to apologise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a8fd50512d1b702263df5c689601080e0e32c91/0_203_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b284915eef938401fb9e8d663de881b","title":"missoula montana us forests mountains arts scene","story":"With forests, mountains and Native American reservations nearby, this town is a goldmine for the adventurous, and there’s a homespun arts scene, too• In this series:  Eugene, Oregon | Chapel Hill, North Carolina | Portland, MaineTen years ago, if you wanted to live in a town on the edge of a mountainous wilderness, surrounded by people prepared to let you be whoever you wanted, you moved to Boulder, Colorado. Everyone did, and property prices became unaffordable. Now you raise your eyes a little further north, and keep your wagon rolling on up to Missoula, Montana, a town about as isolated as the most voracious reader of Henry David Thoreau could hope for.Missoula is an oasis of civilisation deep in the Rockies, surrounded by Native American reservations, national forests and five different mountain ranges. Deer pass through people’s front yards moose can be seen from the road and bears sometimes venture downtown to Greenough Park.While Missoulians have many of the same outdoorsy preoccupations as the rest of cowboy country – huntin’, shootin’ and fishin’ – they’re also stubbornly different in other ways. Suspicious of Missoula’s artsy inclinations (the University of Montana has a renowned creative writing programme) and the wild parties said to go on there, Montanans dubbed it “Zootown”. The townsfolk certainly know how to have a good time – the population of 72,000 sustains a live music scene that would be the envy of somewhere five times as big.Kiah Abbey works at Forward Montana, an advocacy group mobilising young people to participate in the political process. “Missoula is really fun,” she says. “A lot of people here love to hike, and in the summer the river is a big focus – everyone is on it.”Development, however, gets a mixed response: a hotel is being built on the site of the demolished Mercantile building, despite some protest, while across the river the “Hip Strip” and the Old Saw Mill district are revitalising their neighbourhoods. But Missoulians are generally stubborn – they don’t want to see too much change.In 1970, an aspiring actor called Jim Caron broke down in Missoula on his way to a friend’s wedding in Oregon and ended up staying on to play Sancho in a local production of Man of La Mancha. The resultant friendship with his Don Quixote, Don Collins, sparked one of the most innovative children’s companies in America. The pair would drive into small communities in a big red bus (complete with scenery, props and costumes), audition local children, and teach them a show in a week. The theatre now employs more than 100 staff, operates in 50 states as well as 15 other countries, and has established Missoula’s Center for the Performing Arts.• 200 North Adams Street, mctinc.org“I go once a month at least,” says Kiah Abbey. “It’s free, and they highlight indigenous artists, which is really cool.” Contemporary Native American works are at the heart of the collection, which is in a 1903 library built by Andrew Carnegie, updated and expanded with a modern gallery in 2006. As well as national travelling exhibitions, the museum hosts regular lectures and activities. “They’ve got community events, they bring in artists to talk about their work, so it’s a fun cultural spot and it attracts a lot of young people,” says Abbey.”• 335 North Pattee Street, missoulaartmuseum.orgMontana is an outdoorsy place year-round. In summer, along with traditional outdoor pursuits there’s also mountain biking, ziplining and chairlift rides, on top of the river fun mentioned earlier. In winter, there’s 2,600 vertical feet of skiing and snowboarding at Snowbowl, just 20 minutes from downtown (and plenty more at Discovery, Blacktail and Lost Trail Powder Mountain). “There’s lots of action sports going on around,” says Samantha Veysey at Board of Missoula. “There are cross-country trails, mountain biking, and people ride fat bikes, too. We have hockey rinks all around so it’s a great place for skating, and visitors can come and use our indoor skateboarding ramp at the back of the shop.”• montanasnowbowlHalf coffee shop, half upmarket canteen, Caffe Dolce is a local favourite thanks to its high-ceilinged, light-filled building and its excellent brunches. “It started as a cafe in the mall,” says Erin White at Missoula Wine Merchants. “But the owner wanted to create a standalone restaurant and he found this spot over on Brook Street, a nice quiet neighbourhood. He took great pains when creating the place – the building looks Italian with its tall windows and frescos – and it’s a lovely balance of traditional Italian food with a Californian twist.” It’s also only a short walk from Rockin’ Rudy’s, Missoula’s beloved record store.• 500 Brooks Street, caffedolceThis is no greasy spoon but the finest French-inspired cuisine Missoula has to offer. “It’s a little pricey,” says Erin, “but it’s really good. The chef-owner, Pearl Cash, has been in the restaurant industry for 40 years and keeps reinventing herself.” The Pearl Cafe is an intimate space but it’s still considerably larger than her last venture, the Alley Cat, which could fit a dozen diners and only three kitchen staff. And while there’s plenty of Montana beef on the menu – including two filet mignon dishes ($34-$38) – the Pearl is known for its fish and seafood, from Idaho trout to Dungeness crab ($29) to seafood blanquette with orange and saffron ($28.75).• 231 East Front Street, pearlcafe.usWhen Scott Gill was a food stylist in California, he hated seeing food wasted. It’s an experience that stayed with him when he finally opened his own restaurant. “Years ago we decided that the best way was just to buy whole animals,” says Gill. “So that drives the menu: filets one day, then a New York Strip, then we’ll move to the ribeye, and smoke the brisket. The big thing for us is sourcing hormone-free, grass-fed beef.”• 131 South Higgins Avenue, scottystable.netMissoula’s most famous hotel, The Florence, didn’t have a lot of luck – it burned to the ground twice, first in 1913 and again in 1936. But the art moderne building which housed it from 1941 – transformed, in more recent years, to an office complex – is a glorious piece of history. Its still-glamorous lobby is open to anyone who wants to put their feet up and its ground-floor restaurant-wine-bar, Red Bird, shares that feel of a communal living space for Missoulians. It has live music every week, plenty of wines by the glass, and a champagne fondue that everyone in the town swears by. • 111 North Higgins Avenue, redbirdrestaurantFrom the moment you walk past the thick velvet curtains, you know that your night here is going to be a comfortable one: the wine list is 14 pages long, ning old world and new. Traditionally more of a beer-drinking town, Missoula has recently started taking wine seriously, and this is a great place to try out the pinot noirs of Willamette Valley and the comparatively local cabernets of Walla Walla (only a five-hour drive from Missoula – relatively close in Montana terms). The cocktail list is full of innovation, from the cucumber cilantro gimlet to a jalapeno-infused tequila that takes no prisoners.• 322 North Higgins Avenue, plonkwineInspired by their mutual love of Scottish single malts, Ryan and Jenny Montgomery began this small-batch distillery in 2012. It took four years before they released their first single malt, made from Montana barley and aged in ex-bourbon barrels. While they were waiting, they came up with a vodka, an aquavit, and their deliciously herbal Whyte Laydie gin.

The Foreign Doctors Are Coming (Channel 4) isn’t explicitly a film about NHS staffing or Brexit – there are only a couple of euphemistic references to increased demand for doctors and leaving the EU isn’t mentioned – but in its meandering, neutral way it tells us a lot about how tricky it is to replace a carefully nurtured asset with a new version shipped in from afar. When that asset is people, it is really hard – mainly for them.Before doctors from outside the EU can join the NHS, they must pass the Plab 2. Set by the General Medical Council at its assessment centre in Manchester, it is a daunting interactive exam in which medics dash in and out of a series of rooms, each containing an actor or a mannequin standing in for a patient, to display their practical skills against the clock. Imagine The Crystal Maze adding a “hospital in meltdown” zone.Andrew Dedman’s light-touch film focuses on Dr Swamy, who is introduced via a textbook “chat to the windscreen”: driving on the morning commute with the camera riding shotgun, he offers an overview of his professional domain that suggests his office is more a comedy stage than a workplace. “The Manchester people have a special accent,” observes Dr Swamy, weaving gaily through drizzle. “What they say is: ‘Nice one, mate. Are you all right, cock?’ It is very, very, very funny here!”With Sue Johnston’s narration shifting from serious to deadpan, and a soundtrack of those nimble, vaguely sarcastic classical flourishes pioneered by The Great British Bake Off, absurdity reigns. A session on explaining the need to insert a catheter into the urethra provides an easy comic win, as a student solemnly converses with what Dr Swamy christens “Mr Smith”: a grey plaster model of a penis, testicles and a pelvis.The scenes with the most thespian fun are ones in which Dr Swamy casts himself as the difficult patient or relative, opposite a student playing a doctor on their rounds. In one of these improvs, Youven, a clammy bag of nerves despite being a qualified medic back in India, tells Dr Swamy that his imaginary wife is “in the hands of God”. Dr Swamy leaps on the error. “I want a proper doctor! Is this how you talk to me?” As soon as his bravura rendering of an insufficiently mollified spouse is over, he looks straight down the lens and grins, a breaking of the fourth wall that even Nev from The Call Centre may have felt was a bit cheeky.Later interviews show, however, that beneath that flip exterior is a solid-silver hero. Dr Swamy keeps in touch with successful former students and is acutely aware of how important his work is, for the NHS and the applicants. As the film goes on, he melts away and we track the doctors: Anna, a sensible type from Brazil blinking levelly through big specs, and Youven, who crumbles painfully.Youven arrived two years ago to start a family and pursue a dream of flourishing in Britain. Most of that time has been spent bringing his English up to speed, while toiling in low-paid jobs. Now it is the big one and his wife and one-year-old daughter are relying on him. Their savings have only just covered the Plab 2’s rather unwelcoming £840 admin fee.People taking important professional exams often make for surprisingly moving observational documentaries – Channel 4 had one last year about cabbies doing The Knowledge that was as gripping as an Olympic final – but this ends up more bleak than exciting. While Anna edges through, Youven is burdened by the sacrifices he and his loved ones have made and he slides irreversibly into a panicked funk.We are told that Youven intends to retake his Plab 2. His ilk deserve all the help they can get, because the stakes, for them and us, look awfully high."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5adeb1ee080784d3fb1c34c51394833a1656a83/0_112_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cac8adee35bfc6b8567bdd44f3fbf54","title":"insatiable netflix comedy fat shaming","story":"The story of a girl who loses weight and takes revenge on her bullies has already inspired an online petition for ‘fat-shaming’ One of the recurring images on Netflix’s new show, Insatiable, is that of the show’s heroine, Patty, played by Debby Ryan, gorging on food. “While my classmates were out losing their virginity,” she says in the first episode, “I was at home stuffing another hole.” The show’s palpable disgust for Patty’s desire for food is visceral. Throughout the series, anytime Patty feels out-of-control, angry, desperate or sad, she immediately begins to binge, whether it’s handfuls of crawfish or gobs of birthday cake. Each time Patty goes on a binge, the camera hones in on her mouth as she shoves food in it, in a way that seems both joyless and fetishistic. Patty’s mouth is the iconic image for the title scene, too. At the start of each episode we see her beautifully made-up mouth with the word “Insatiable” in front of it. In one opening, Patty holds a match between her lips. In others, we see her mouth biting or inhaling the words in front of it. Each time, the trailer closes on her smile, as she shows off perfectly white teeth.Though the trailer for the series, which prompted a furious outcry among concerned viewers, seemed to suggest that this was a story of an overweight girl getting skinny and seeking revenge on those who bullied her, Insatiable is more accurately a story of a young woman who has a binge-eating disorder. In fact, one of the more offensive aspects of the series (and there are many aspects that are offensive) is that fatness itself is synonymous with disordered eating. Throughout the series, Patty’s weight is perceived as a kind of moral failing, as evidence that her desires are just completely out of control. Certainly, one of the “jokes” of the series is that thin Patty is flailing just as much as “Fatty Patty” did. Though she suddenly has tons of positive reinforcement about her looks, she doesn’t feel good about herself or her body. The years of being bullied still haunt her, and her response to any and all stress or setbacks is to act out in ways that are vicious, cruel or just plain crazy.Insatiable is clearly striving to be an edgy satire of our image-obsessed culture and our constant need for more, but the candy-colored veneer of the series never offers viewers an actual escape from the toxic tropes it attempts to skewer. In fact, the show often seems intent on embodying the very stereotypes that it claims to be dismantling. Patty is shown being teased mercilessly when she is fat, and then ogled constantly after she drops the weight. Her character has daddy issues, is a cutthroat and cruel pageant contestant, and has very few interests, ideas or thoughts outside of her looks (except for the fact that she really loves Drew Barrymore). The way that the camera focuses on Patty’s body in various scenes is often odd and distracting, and seems to emphasize that the viewer shouldn’t really be able to see Patty beyond her looks either.Other characters in the series are also presented as tropes that don’t get complicated in ways that are particularly interesting, and yet aren’t campy enough to get played off as simply absurd. We meet “trailer trash” characters with thick southern accents and tacky wardrobes, and the wealthy white collar strivers who are just as seedy and ridiculous under their fake veneer of elegance. We see the world of beauty pageants as being fake, charmless and ugly. Religious institutions are shown to be judgmental, foolish and patently unhelpful in the quest for spiritual enlightenment. There are jokes about race, sexual orientation and sexual molestation, all of which seem intent on being shocking, without being particularly funny. There are also a lot of dirty jokes based on a fast food place called Taco Weiner.Insatiable’s best qualities are its quick-paced plot and the fact that it doesn’t take itself too seriously. Its worst aspect though, and one that I view to be an irredeemable one, is the fact that it pretends that any of its messages are intended to help teenagers navigate a cruel world or feel better about themselves. In reality, Insatiable isn’t skewering the ridiculous expectations placed on teen girls it’s merely reiterating them. It doesn’t provide a sensitive and humorous reflection on the experience of binge eating disorder it’s placing Debby Ryan in a fat suit for cheap laughs.Insatiable’s arrival comes at an odd time, a season after Marti Noxon’s Dietland, a fantastic takedown of fat-shaming and the cruelty of beauty culture, and a few months after a company decided to start marketing weight loss reduction lollipops to teen girls and young women using bright pink colors and images of beautiful young women with heavily made-up lips delightedly sucking on lollipops instead of eating food. In response, you had some celebrities like Kim Kardashian West jump on the opportunist bandwagon (after receiving a lot of backlash from an Instagram post supporting the product, West deleted her post) and others like Jameela Jamil posting outrage about the ways that young women are taught to feel bad about themselves. It seems as though Insatiable is trying to straddle these two aspects of our current culture, attempting to attract earnest viewers who struggle with body image issues as well as viewers who would be more than happy to laugh at the life of a “former fat girl”.After the trailer for Insatiable aired, hundreds of thousands of people signed a petition for Netflix to cancel the series, arguing it would be dangerous for teen girls and anyone who struggles with eating. At first blush, this type of response is heartening, but I’ve been a cultural critic long enough to know that an explosion of cultural discourse, no matter how well-written and smart, isn’t necessarily enough to actually facilitate cultural change. In fact, controversy itself can often be just as effective in drumming up viewers as quality programming, and I wonder if the petition against Insatiable itself may actually end up getting this slight series more buzz than it honestly deserves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21bf7415727c2ff61160be435c41659013bfe939/0_102_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91e7328457fc3385542b714e41df1a5f","title":"lost in translation can british remakes of american shows work","story":"Hang Ups, the new Stephen Mangan comedy based on Lisa Kudrow’s original, is a rare example of the UK successfully taking on a US hitIt’s an old habit of the Brits to curl our lips with superiority at American attempts to remake British shows, as if mocking their efforts to brew a decent cup of tea. Attempts to remake The Inbetweeners, The IT Crowd, even Are You Being Served? have all flopped for want of understanding the subtle ingredients that perhaps made them suited to a transatlantic crossing. But what of British adaptations of American shows? They have their own chequered history.Currently, however, there is the potential of a success. Hang Ups, the new Channel 4 series starring and co-written by Stephen Mangan, based on Web Therapy, the fine series created by Lisa Kudrow of Friends in 2011. Both are based on the same concept – online therapy sessions with the potential for multiple high-profile guest stars. However, whereas Kudrow’s Fiona Wallice is a comically self-absorbed “therapist” with a mass of unhelpful, ulterior motives, Mangan’s Richard Pitt is a more hapless and stressed, altogether more British creation. He’s deep in debt, surrounded by a whirl of family and the attendant problems they bring, not least his own father, played by Charles Dance.There have been some notorious failures, perhaps the most ignominious of which was The Brighton Belles, a remake of The Golden Girls, already a hit series in the UK, which was such a commercial and critical flop that it was pulled halfway through its run, as if with a discreet vaudeville hook from the side of the stage. Despite the pedigree of Sheila Hancock and Wendy Craig, no one had an any earthly reason to watch such a flagrant replication of an already well-loved show, any more than they would go to the zoo to see what was a cow quite obviously dressed up as a buffalo. Russ Abbott, meanwhile, was as ill-suited to star in Married For Life, a remake of the American series Married With Children, a masterpiece of sleazy, no-hugging-no-learning comedy as he would have been to take over as lead singer of Joy Division.There have, however, been more successful efforts in other TV genres. The British version of The Apprentice managed to attain the same effect as the original American version, having us rooting against the obnoxious but often inept aspirants, jumped-up estate agents obsequiously vying for the favour of an alpha-ogre, be it Trump or Sugar. It is surprising to learn the number of gameshows that originated in the US. Blankety Blank was based on Match Game, a show that first premiered on NBC in 1962 with the same rules as its British remake, but a very different feel. In the hands of its first host, Terry Wogan, and then Les Dawson, it turned into a show that drily undercut its own primetime naffness. Similar, Sale Of the Century, the “quiz of the week” back in the 70s in which contestants competed for sums up to £100 was not from Norwich, but from NBC again. Yet, the matchlessly slick Nicholas Parsons made it his own and left no hint of its American origin. Dale Winton similarly made his own indelible stamp on Supermarket Sweep, another US remake. The same could not be said of ITV’s The Price Is Right, however, starring the late Leslie Crowther, wildly successful as it was. This had first been broadcast in America in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was remade in Britain in 1984 at the height of the dizzily acquisitive years of ThatcherismReaganism in full throttle. Crowther, best known to viewers of a certain age as Peter Glaze’s comic sidekick in kids’ show Crackerjack reinvented himself as a rooting-tooting, razzle-dazzle host whipping up audiences and game participants into a frenzy of materialistic greed. His invite to “come on down!” felt very unseemly and un-English to conservatives, while to lefties, it was a televisual example of Britain as 51st state of the US.Back to comedy, however. Perhaps one reason British adaptations of American shows have not always fared well is that great American sitcoms, for example, enjoyed greater resources. In particular in terms of writers which helped raise their overall standards, as opposed to British comedies that were generally written by much smaller teams. It helps that Hang Ups has quality running throughout. From a quality cast, including Katherine Parkinson, and a raft of guests and bit-parters including Richard E Grant and Jessica Hynes, as well as writing assistance from Neil and Rob Gibbons, who have done such good work reviving the Alan Partridge character in recent years. Others hoping to remake American comedy in Britain should watch this and learn.

His defence team is seeking to pin the blame on Gates, who they say was responsible for day-to-day operations of the business.In a dramatic moment before the jury, Manafort’s defence counsel, Kevin Downing, put it to the government’s star witness: “There’s another life, right, the other Rick Gates? The secret Rick Gates?”Gates, who is 46 and married, admitted: “There was a period in my life, about 10 years ago, when I had a relationship, yes.”With a nod to linguistic differences for what Americans refer to as an apartment, Downing pressed: “As part of your secret life did you maintain a flat – is that what they call it? – in London?”Gates acknowledged that he did for two months and that he took first class flights and stayed in “fancy hotels” around Europe, but said the money came from bonuses rather than illicit gains. “I had a period of time when I had another relationship,” he added.As well as being a senior aide on Trump’s election campaign, Gates served as the deputy chairman of the US president’s inaugural committee. On Tuesday, he admitted it was possible he had sought to cheat the committee with false expenses claims.“Did you submit personal expenses to the inaugural committee for reimbursement?” Downing asked.Gates appeared nervous on the witness stand at the court in Alexandria, Virginia, blinking frequently, his throat apparently dry as he spoke. He frequently used the phrases “It’s possible” and “I don’t recall” as Downing challenged him about inconsistencies in testimony he gave to the special counsel’s office.“When did you start providing false and misleading information to the special counsel’s office?” the defence counsel asked bluntly.Gates struggled so badly to give a straight answer that eventually Judge T S Ellis III was forced to intervene. “Did you provide false information or did you have a bad memory?” he asked.Gates finally admitted that he had provided false information prior to striking a plea agreement. “I did, to one count, your honour,” he said.He has already admitted embezzling some funds from Manafort. Downing pressed him on the specifics of their business relationship: which payments to Gates were authorised and which were not. Regarding a trading company Manafort had started with a partner in 2011, he asked with deep scepticism: “You’re asking the jury to believe Mr Manafort authorised another $250,000 as a bonus?”Gates testified that he stole from Manafort because he was living beyond his means. Downing asked: “Was it for your secret life?”The witness replied defensively: “It’s not a secret life. It went to an account my wife knew about.”Though he has at times seemed evasive under cross-examination, Gates insisted that he now acknowledges his mistake and is taking responsibility for it, whereas Manafort is not.But Downing challenged again: “After all the lies you’ve told and fraud you’ve committed, you expect this jury to believe you?”Earlier on Tuesday, the prosecution had continued to question Gates, who described how millions of dollars were allegedly funneled from entities controlled by Ukrainian businessmen into Manafort’s shell companies in Cyprus.Although the allegations of collusion between Donald Trump and Russia are not at issue in this trial, any significant blows to the government’s case are likely to be seized on by the president’s defenders, including conservative media, to support his contention that Mueller’s investigation is a “rigged witch-hunt”.Gates pleaded guilty in February and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors under a deal that could lead to a reduced sentence. On Monday, he testified that he helped Manafort file false tax returns and hide his foreign bank accounts. He was aware that Manafort was acting as an unregistered foreign agent in lobbying for Ukraine, he said.On Tuesday, the court was shown a series of emails, contracts and what prosecutor Greg Andres referred to as “fake invoices”, in which Gates altered the template to show the name of a shell company instead of Manafort’s. This was a way to decrease Manafort’s taxable income, added Gates, who did not report the money to Manafort’s bookkeeper or accountants.Manafort’s political work included advising Viktor Yanukovych on policy after he won the Ukrainian presidency, Gates said. “Mr Manafort worked with the local political officials and helped implement policy initiatives based on the campaign promises.”For this Manafort was paid $4m a year, in quarterly payments of $1m, Gates recalled, though at some point the currency switched from US dollars to Euros. His consultancy work also included “Engage Ukraine”, an effort to help Ukraine join the European Union.Government lawyers have previously referred to Yanukovych as Manafort’s “golden goose”. After Yanukovych lost power in 2014, “I would say it decreased the income stream”, Gates, wearing a blue suit, told the court matter-of-factly.He added Manafort worked for a time for the Opposition Bloc, the party that replaced Yanukovych’s Party of Regions, but it was out of power and so “income streams were more difficult to come by”.By July 2015, the court heard, Manafort was struggling financially. Andres asked: “Was he having trouble paying his bills?” Gates replied: “He was.”Gates said he and Manafort turned to a Cypriot lawyer, whom he referred to in court as “Dr K”, who set up bank accounts and shell companies on Manafort’s behalf and “handled everything”.When an inidual sets up an entity in Cyprus, Gates explained, their name does not appear on any of the paperwork. He said of Manafort: “I believe he understood his name would not be represented, nor would mine.”As Manafort came under pressure to pay his bills, he was forced to seek loans, the court heard. Gates said he was responsible for collecting all relevant documents for the loan applications.Andres asked him: “Did you provide false information to the banks?’Again the reply came: “Yes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/591d5c85faace0776df8f2ca3aec6ed277257582/0_410_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d28b968cae2764b668a648e05a26210b","title":"easter island people want british museum return moai statue","story":"Hoa Hakananai’a was taken by Royal Navy captain 150 years ago as gift for Queen VictoriaEaster Island’s indigenous people have asked Chile’s government to help them recover a unique Moai statue removed 150 years ago and now kept in the British Museum in London.The seven-foot-tall (2.4-metre) Hoa Hakananai’a sculpture was removed from the island by Richard Powell, captain of HMS Topaze, in 1868 and given to Queen Victoria, who donated it to the museum in 1869.“It’s a unique piece, the only tangible link that accounts for two important stages in our ancestral history,” the island’s Rapa Nui authorities said on Tuesday.Of the more than 900 giant humanoid sculptures on the island, most were carved from volcanic ash between the sixth and 17th centuries, but the Hoa Hakananai’a, which means “the stolen or hidden friend” in the Rapa Nui language, is unique as it was made from basalt.Figures associated with the Tangata Manu (“bird man”) cult were carved on its back.This request “seems appropriate given the new coordination and conservation functions being carried out on the island with regards the Moai,” said Felipe Ward, Chile’s national treasures minister.Since December, the Rapa Nui have taken over the conservation, preservation and management of their archeological heritage.Part of that involves the attempted recovery of priceless artefacts they say were illegally taken, including another Moai residing in the Quai Branly museum in Paris.The Rapa Nui believe that the spiritual force which protects them resides in Moai and other sacred objects.Recovering stolen statues would also be “an important symbol in closing the sad chapter of violation of our rights by European navigators” that visited the island in the 19th century, local leaders said.Easter Island is a Unesco world heritage site about 2,000 miles (3,700km) off the coast of Chile, and whose indigenous inhabitants are a Polynesian people closely related to those in Tahiti.The Pacific Ocean island was first recorded by European navigators in 1722 and visited several times, including by the Briton James Cook, before it was annexed by Chile in 1888.By then, much of its population had been decimated by European diseases such as smallpox, or carted off into slavery.Chile recently announced measures to limit the time tourists can stay on the island and the number of non-Rapa Nui mainlanders allowed to settle there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5befc623e90698615f7a81454712a6186f35570e/0_186_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=191ede206cf0b677dcf0fd94d3a7bdc4","title":"north korea leader kim jong un inspects things in pictures","story":"Images of the dictator on tour offer insights on the life of one of the world’s most secretive rulers – and serve to bolster the cult of personality surrounding him"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3589199.1533675868!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"planning backlog stalls college green and poolbeg schemes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA decision on the €10m civic plaza at College Green, already been beset by delays, will not be made until October 5th. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe board has had to delay decisions, due this month, on both the College Green plaza development and the construction of more than 3,000 homes on the Poolbeg peninsula because it has not been able to process the volume of appeals it receives, it has emerged. A decision on the €10 million civic plaza at College Green, which has already been beset by delays, had been due this week, but will not now be made until October 5th, leaving commuters to face ongoing traffic congestion and ersion of public transport in the heart of the city.Dublin City Council said it had not been notified of any change in decision date by the board, which had originally been due to issue its verdict last November.The plans for the fast-track development of up to 3,500 apartments in a new strategic development zone (SDZ) centred on the former Glass Bottle site at Poolbeg were due for a board decision last week. This has been delayed indefinitely.A letter from the board, seen by The , states it has not been able to make its August 1st deadline, and no new decision date has been set.The inspector, who conducted the hearing on the Poolbeg development last April, has delivered his report to the board, the letter states, but the “continuing delay is due to necessity to clear the current backlog of cases” waiting to be assessed by the board. “The delay involved is regretted,” the letter says.The board has a target of processing planning appeals within 18 weeks, and had been achieving that goal in 80 per cent of cases . However this year, just 35 per cent of cases have been determined within that time frame.A spokesman for the board said the number of board members had more than halved last year to just four. While numbers had since been increased to 11, it was still working through the resulting case backlog. A “hugely revamped” IT system had also resulted in delays, he said.Dublin City Council approved plans for the fast-track development of homes for up to 8,000 people in a new urban quarter at Poolbeg last September, but the scheme was appealed to the board.If the board approves the SDZ, the council will have the power to grant planning permission that cannot be appealed to the board. Landowners could secure permission within two months of submitting their application to the council.The failure of the board to issue a decision was a “disaster” for the thousands of families hoping to set up home in the area, Labour Senator Kevin Humphreys said.“This was meant to result in ‘fast-track’ housing but I haven’t seen any urgency from the Minister for Housing to get what was meant to be one of the key projects to deal with the housing crisis over the line.”An Board Pleanála needed to be “properly resourced” so it could make timely decisions on essential developments , Mr Humphreys said.“We won’t see homes get out of the ground if they can’t get out of the starting blocks at board level.

Photograph: Nick BradshawA group of housing activists have occupied an inner city property, where over 20 foreign nationals were evicted in May.On Tuesday a small number of iniduals broke into the property, 35 Summerhill Parade, Ballybough, Dublin 1.A large group of activists from several housing campaign groups marched from the GPO on O’Connell Street to the property. Groups included Dublin Central Housing Action, the Dublin Renters’ Union, and student protest group Take Back Trinity.Two iniduals in the home wearing Leo Varadkar face masks hung a banner with the words “Homes for All” from the second floor window of the house.At 8pm, ten more people entered the property with the intention of occupying the property overnight. The sound of drilling could be heard behind the door of the property.The home is believed to have been vacant since early May. It was vacated following an inspection by Dublin Fire Brigade, which raised fire safety issues at the property, a Dublin City Council spokeswoman said.A large number of primarily Brazilian tenants were evicted with 24 hours notice from the house, and five other neighbouring homes on the street.Speaking to The  in May, tenants did not know who their landlord was, and only dealt with a letting agent. A spokesman for Dublin Central Housing Action said they had not been able to confirm who the landlord of the property was.Speaking outside of the occupation, Conor Reddy (22), a member of Take Back Trinity, said the coalition of groups had occupied the building to “demand public housing.”The student group occupied a building in Trinity College Dublin to protest a proposed increase in repeat exam fees to €450, which the university reversed following the protest.“Homes should be for need and not for greed. The action is about taking back power over these properties, this property has been vacant now for a number of months,” he said.Peter Dowley (43) from Dublin’s Renters Union said the action was necessary as there was a “massive housing crisis” in Ireland.“There’s so many people being evicted from their homes, and so many vacant homes. It’s about time we take over a vacant property and demand the council purchase it.”“Renters don’t have any security of tenure. We need long term security of tenure,” he said.Juliana Sassi (30) a member of the Dublin branch of Brazilian Left Front, a grassroots left wing group who assisted tenants evicted from the property in May, was also outside the occupation.She said Brazilian students and workers in Ireland were taken advantage of in the Dublin rental market.“We have a problem with communication or knowing our rights, so we are under worse circumstances. Overcrowding is normal, in houses people are living in 20 people per house, bunk beds everywhere,” she said.While activists barricaded themselves into the property, a large number of people remained outside the home on Tuesday evening."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584276.1533214652!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"united ireland the south of ireland doesn t want us and can t afford us","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister Peter Robinson at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties. Photograph: North West NewspixOmagh man Kevin Skelton shakes his head when asked what he thinks about former DUP leader Peter Robinson’s advice to unionists that they need to think about preparing for a Border poll which could lead to Irish unity.He later pleaded guilty in an Irish court to unlawful assembly, and paid a large fine, thus avoiding a jail term but earning the nickname, Peter the Punt. “I know what I’d do with a Border poll, where I’d push it,” says Skelton.“I couldn’t give a hoot, couldn’t care less. The south of Ireland doesn’t want us, doesn’t need us and can’t afford us. If the vote was held on both sides of the Border they’d likely reject us. Peter Robinson and Mary Lou McDonald would be better putting their time into getting the assembly back together. There’s none of them wants to deal with the past.”Skelton’s wife Mena was one of the 31 people (including unborn twins) murdered in Omagh when the Real IRA’s massive 1998 carbomb exploded without warning on Main Street. Prepared in the Republic, it had been driven north, passing through Clontibret, and across the border into Tyrone.Relatives and friends are bracing themselves for the 20th anniversary on the 15th of this month. The views of the survivors are as erse as the backgrounds from which their loved ones came and Skelton does not claim to speak for anyone other than himself, though his anger at what he sees as the neglect of the victims is widely shared. He thinks a Border poll is irrelevant, and that Brexit is the critical issue.“My fear is that Brexit could start the Troubles up again. I’d be out of here if there was a hard border,” he said. However, he also believes that the real Border in Northern Ireland is the river Bann. The newly released NI statistics on deprivation support his view that the most prosperous areas are in the northeast, with the western Border areas among the most disadvantaged.“Omagh was already struggling on the shavings from the table, and it never recovered from the bomb,” said Skelton. “It is well on its way to being a ghost town.”Further north and further west, the city of Derry has lately been in the news because of a flare up of street violence among young people under the influence of dissident republicans. The violence included sectarian attacks on the Fountain estate, a tiny unionist enclave alongside the old city walls on the by now almost entirely nationalist west bank of the river Foyle.On Wednesday night a remarkably civil and wideranging debate took place on the other side of the river, the largely unionist Waterside, in a Protestant church hall. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and DUP MP and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson were among the speakers discussing the future of the Northern state.The event was one of 40 in the New Gate Fringe Festival, organised by the North West Cultural Partnership, which includes the Londonderry Bands Forum the membership of which is drawn from young men from some of the most deprived loyalist estates in the region. Public debates including working class nationalists and republicans have long been a feature of Northern political life. An audience predominantly made up, as this one was, of working class unionists is far more rare.“What’s your take, Sir Jeffrey?” said June Elder. Donaldson said the DUP was very clear on the question. “Peter does not speak for the DUP. He is retired. I do,” he said. “I don’t share his view.”Considering such a poll would polarise people and cause further ision, he had not had a single email from a constituent about it. “We are preparing for Brexit.”Elder came back after his response with a supplementary question. “So was Peter just off on a rant?” she asked. “No,” said Donaldson with a tight smile. “He was expressing his opinion.”“Well,” retorted Elder, sceptically, to laughter. “My TV shows the same as yours.”Joe Thompson said he was a unionist but he was angry with the DUP. “For decades they’ve insisted this part of the country is British and now with Brexit they say it can’t be treated any differently from England, Scotland and Wales,” he said. “But people are treated differently when it comes to reproductive rights, marriage rights and the Irish language act.”Donaldson said devolution meant that different parts of the UK would have different laws. He said the place to legislate for the issues Thompson raised was at Stormont and reiterated his party leader Arlene Foster’s accusation that Sinn Féin was “holding to ransom” the parties which wished to resume powersharing. “We no longer have a veto,” he said, pointing out that to use a “petition of concern” to block new legislation 30 votes were needed. “We only have 28,” he said.McDonald retorted that Foster had just that morning backed the use of a blocking mechanism to prevent a local council from flying the rainbow flag this weekend, Saturday August 4th, as part of LGBTQ Pride events around the North.Afterwards, Thompson, who works in Derry and lives in Mid Ulster, told The  he was not satisfied with Donaldson’s response. “The DUP is coming across as just so arrogant,” he said. “They’d get their 30 votes to block progressive change – they know it and so do we. I support the union but I vote Alliance now. Peter Robinson was right to say what he did about a Border poll. It is going to happen and the chaos that followed the Brexit vote showed that we need preparations.”The audience at the debate strikingly included many young people. On his way out after an intense 2½ hours, Chris Smith said a Border poll would be pointless. “It is not a question people need answered,” he said. “I am a unionist and I want the politicians either to get Stormont up and running or go back to Direct Rule. As it is we are losing out every way. My girlfriend works in the NHS here and she has just had to forego a payrise that colleagues elsewhere are getting. My mate is a firefighter but because of cuts his job is about to be lost.”Julia Kee, a community worker on a programme made possible by the EU’s Peace 4 funding, shared this view. “We have more important things to be thinking about than a Border poll,” she said. “I am a unionist and we have been hearing nothing but this anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights talk from the DUP.“The political impasse is creating political unrest around Northern Ireland including here in this city,” she said. “Then you get politicians calling young people scumbags and that does not help.”Hospital consultant Fergal McNicholl is from Greysteel, the Co Derry village which became internationally known after loyalists burst into a pub there in 1993 and sprayed it with gunfire, killing eight people. He came to the debate at the invitation of his friend, Dave Duggan, a writer from the city.“I felt quite privileged to be here tonight,” said McNicholl. “It was very impressive that they got a mixed audience and the fact that there was no tension was a massive step forward.” He was not inclined to favour preparing for a Border poll. “The territorial issue puts our identity back into conflict – I quite like it the way it was,” he said. “There was a period where I felt I could be comfortably Irish in this town and live beside someone who was comfortably British. Brexit has already raised territorial issues. It makes things harder. It unsettles us.”Georgina Campbell is a young dancer. She told the panel that she was worried and wanted to know if, in a new Ireland, the likes of her would have a place. She said that the Highland dancing that is her medium is rooted in British military history and that the highest honour available is to dance for the queen. Afterwards, she explained that a Border poll meant nothing to her.“We should just have a government,” she said. “My three best friends are nationalist girls who are self-employed artists. Highland dancers and Irish dancers work together on a regular basis, but a lot of our cultural activities are in our own communities. Northern Ireland is unique and special. We need to embrace it and we need to market it. It is just this big mad eclectic place. I love it so much – I’ll never move away.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3588994.1533661345!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"beijing a city transformed a decade after landmark olympics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChinese visitors congregate beside the National Stadium, also known as The Bird’s Nest, at the Beijing Olympic Park in Beijing,  on Tuesday. Photograph: Wu HongEPAThe weather in Beijing is less polluted than it was 10 years ago before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, but the boiling hot city over which the stormy August clouds look down has been transformed in the 10 years since that spectacular event.The ruling Communist Party spent billions of yuan to ensure a pristine picture of China was transmitted to the world on the highly auspicious eighth day of the eighth month of the eighth year of the new century.Ten years after the dazzling choreography of the opening ceremony in the National Stadium – aka the Bird’s Nest – the Olympic venues have not thrived. Most are at best underused and at worse abandoned.But the Olympics were really only a staging post in a much more fundamental reshaping of the Chinese capital.Yes, spitting was frowned upon and the populace encouraged to put on a smile, but the real story was the capital’s metamorphosis, the shocking demolition of traditional hutong laneways and courtyard houses to make way for giant apartment blocks, new subway lines, airports and overpass highways.Life goes on. Lily (32), a project manager for a translation firm, finds it harder to get an apartment than it was 10 years ago, or to get a car or even a licence plate – rules to alleviate pollution mean anyone who wants to buy a new car has to apply for a licence plate lottery.She finished college 10 years ago, right before the Olympics, in Yanjiao, a satellite town about 90 minutes by bus from Beijing, which became popular as a place to live as rents were lower.“Everything is changing here so fast – what has not changed? I remember during these past 10 years how when I travelled from Yanjiao to Beijing, I could see the smog before reaching the city. I think the air quality now is definitely better, but I’m not sure how long this will last. Some years it is good but some years bad,” she says.“The price of rents is going crazy. I used to pay 2,000 yuan (€252) for a room near the east fourth ring road but now I am paying 3,000 yuan for a room almost at the east sixth ring road. I am paying more but have to move further out,” she says.The city’s population burgeoned, particularly with the sharp increase in migrant workers who came to the capital to build the megalopolis that Beijing is today. The population is currently 22 million, five million more than in 2008.That has led to tensions between the laobaixing (original residents) and some waidiren (migrant workers). Some of the people who have moved to the capital have now become middle-class, even joined the ranks of the newly rich. “The changes in Beijing have not always been good for the migrant workers but also not positive for the Beijingers,” said Lily.The destruction of areas of the city where migrant workers live has continued under president Xi Jinping as the city’s renovation continues.Zhang Tian (37), who works for a financial software firm, believes both salaries and costs have jumped since the games.“We get paid more but at the same time we have to pay a higher price for our daily necessities. The air quality is getting better gradually, and maybe it’s possible we will have a more beautiful sky during our lifetime. At the same time, there are still a lot of people in this city, that certainly hasn’t changed in 10 years,” says Zhang.The Olympics capped the end of three decades of opening up and reform. In the intervening decade, China’s international role has become more significant. It is now the world’s second biggest economy, helping prop up the global economy after the financial crisis that struck a year after the games.“China’s international reputation right now is where it should be. I don’t think it’s improved, it’s just been restored to where it used to be,” said Zhang.Fu He, who works for a technology company, believes China is better known after the Olympics, though he’s not sure if the country’s international reputation has changed all that much. It would take more than the Olympics to change a country’s reputation.While he also feels the city remains very congested and grumbles about the rise in property prices, generally he is positive. The Olympics gave people a confidence boost in the city.“We can buy whatever we want and we can eat whatever we want to eat. But it is getting more expensive. Public transport is better because of subway construction, although the roads are more congested. But the general sports culture is better. Things are better,” he says."},{"url":null,"title":"nasas daring mission touch sun explained","story":"Nasa is preparing to embark on a daring mission to touch the sun on Saturday,  aiming to go closer than any other spacecraft has ventured.The Parker Solar Probe will endure wicked heat while zooming through the solar corona to study this outermost part of the stellar atmosphere that gives rise to the solar wind.The launch is currently targeted for August 11 at 3:33 a.m. EDT (8.33am BST), with an extended launch window through to August 23.To send a probe where you haven\u0027t been before is ambitious. To send it into such brutal conditions is highly ambitious, Nicola Fox, a project scientist from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, said.The project, with a $1.5 billion price tag, is the first major mission under Nasa\u0027s Living With a Star programme.Nasa is hoping to use the data collected from the probe to help astronomers predict solar storms and explain some of the deepest mysteries surrounding our source of light and heat.The probe, named after American solar astrophysicist Eugene Newman Parker, is set to use seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to steadily reduce its orbit around the Sun, using instruments designed to image the solar wind and study electric and magnetic fields, coronal plasma and energetic particles.Nasa aims to collect data about the inner workings of the highly magnetized corona.Although 4 million miles sounds like a long way by our tiny standards here on Earth, being that close to the sun is likely to be a risk for the spacecraft.For example, by orbiting the sun at a distance of between 28 and 43 million miles, Mercury\u0027s surface and atmosphere have been completely changed by the constant stream of radiation and particles from the sun.It has been outfitted with a heat shield designed to keep its instruments at a tolerable 29 degrees Celsius even as the spacecraft faces temperatures reaching nearly 1,370 degrees Celsius at its closest pass.The closest a spacecraft has been before is when Helios 2 came within 27 million miles of the sun in 1976. By way of comparison, the average distance from the Sun for Earth is 93 million miles.Technicians and engineers perform light bar testing on NASA\u0026#39s Parker Solar Probe at the Astrotech processing facility in TitusvilleThe information collected from the probe is likely to help future generations of humans, who may one day live outside the Earth\u0027s atmosphere.Our world has since grown ever more dependent on a network of technology – both in orbit and on our planet\u0027s surface – that\u0027s vulnerable to a threat we barely understand.These people will need the knowledge to protect themselves from severe winds of charged particles and radiation.The resulting data will improve forecasts of major space-weather events that impact life on Earth, as well as satellites and astronauts in space.Alex Young, a solar scientist at NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland, said it was of fundamental importance for us to be able to predict this space weather, much like we predict weather here on Earth.In the most extreme cases of these space weather events, it can actually affect our power grids here on Earth, he added.Please review our commenting policyMore than 50 firefighters tackle to Manchester blazeIan Paisley could become first MP recalled from Parliament under new laws, following  probeBoris Johnson could face disciplinary action over burka comments, says former ministerSenior Zimbabwe opposition figure Tendai Biti \u0026#39arrested at border\u0026#39 Easter Island seeks return of \u0026#39stolen\u0026#39 Moai statue from the British Museum\u0026#39Firenado\u0026#39 filmed in DerbyshireSNP under fire after Higher pass rates fall again and S4 passes nosee by a thirdTeenager stabbed in mass brawl after Scottish exam results releasedBBC asks Microsoft for information that could identify Doctor Who leakerComment: Pop stars\u0026#39 philosophies are much more entertaining than their musicGainsborough: rediscovering the radical side of Britain\u0026#39s greatest portrait painterPatients may walk away from NHS because of long GP waits, Britain\u0026#39s leading family doctor warnsComment: There\u0026#39s a strong Conservative case to be made for global warmingComment: Why is the Government going to so much trouble to ensure adults can access violent pornography?

He’s only seen the trailer and in the trailer, it makes him off to be a buffoonish cartoonish idiot.”After being asked if Duke is depicted fairly in the film, Stallworth said: ”In some areas, yeah.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for KFC’s Mars Krushems drink which appeared on a telephone box a short distance from the entrance to a primary school, for breaking rules around the promotion of products high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS). Under advertising rules, HFSS product ads must not be directed at children through the selection of the media or context in which they appear, and no medium should be used to promote HFSS products if more than 25 per cent of its audience is under the age of 16.The Obesity Health Alliance challenged the ad on the grounds that it was directed at children. KFC said the advert was mistakenly placed within 100 metres of the school, and apologised for the placement, blaming human error. The ASA said it was taking action as it was “highly likely” that the ad’s location meant that children under 16 made up “significantly more than 25 per cent of the audience of the ad”. Meanwhile, an ad for Kellogg’s Coco Pops Granola which was shown between episodes of the children’s programme ‘Mr Bean’ has also been banned.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for KFC’s Mars Krushems drink which appeared on a telephone box a short distance from the entrance to a primary school, for breaking rules around the promotion of products high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS). Under advertising rules, HFSS product ads must not be directed at children through the selection of the media or context in which they appear, and no medium should be used to promote HFSS products if more than 25 per cent of its audience is under the age of 16.The Obesity Health Alliance challenged the ad on the grounds that it was directed at children. KFC said the advert was mistakenly placed within 100 metres of the school, and apologised for the placement, blaming human error. The ASA said it was taking action as it was “highly likely” that the ad’s location meant that children under 16 made up “significantly more than 25 per cent of the audience of the ad”. Meanwhile, an ad for Kellogg’s Coco Pops Granola which was shown between episodes of the children’s programme ‘Mr Bean’ has also been banned.

Or is he Ed Sheeran? Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

Even if small portion of these waves escapes the immediate vicinity of Ganymede, they will be capable of accelerating particles to very high energies and ultimately producing very fast electrons inside Jupiter\u0027s magnetic field.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/18/08/musk3.jpg","title":"tesla elon musk tweet stock market share price private funding","story":"Created with Sketch.The entrepreneur wrote: \u0027Am considering taking Tesla private at $420.

Funding secured.”The Financial Times had earlier reported that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had built a $2bn stake in the company.Tesla stock, which was trading at $342, jumped, ending\u0026nbspthe trading day up 11 per cent at $379.57.That left the\u0026nbspmarket capitalisation of Tesla, which has been experiencing production difficulties and recently\u0026nbspasked suppliers to refund some payments, at around $64bn.A $420 share price would value the company at around $70bn.Musk has a history of erratic tweeting, prompting some initial scepticism about whether the Tesla plan was serious.Musk was recently forced to apologise after calling a British cave er who helped rescue the trapped Thai schoolboys a “pedo”. He has also been embroiled in spats with journalists and analysts.But Musk later on Tuesday seemed to confirm\u0026nbspthe plan, Tweeting\u0026nbspthat: “Investor support is confirmed.

And\u0026nbspthe second-lowest rise in men’s life expectancy, with only the\u0026nbspUS doing worse.Former pensions minister Sir Steve Webb pointed to a “human cost” behind the statistics and called on the government to investigate what is causing the trend.Global cancer cases rise by a third in a decade, finds major studyMen could have same life expectancy as women by 2030s, research findsLife expectancy of the poorest women in EnglandThe analysis of 20 countries shows many have seen mortality rates decline at a slower rate since 2011.Increases in life expectancy among women in the UK dropped from 12.9 weeks in 2005 to 2010 every year, to 1.2 weeks in 2011 to 2015 –\u0026nbspthe largest slowdown of all 20 countries examined.The US experienced the greatest slowing in life expectancy for males at birth, dropping from an increase of 14.1 weeks each year from 2005 to 2010, to only 1.5 weeks per year from 2010 to 2015.Britain had the second lowest rate of improvement, with the increase falling from 17.3 weeks per year to 4.2 weeks per year across the same period.The “large drop” in the UK is in part due to a significant increase in male life expectancy between 2001 and 2011, the ONS said.However it added that Switzerland, which had the highest life expectancy at birth for males in 2016, maintained 12.5 weeks per year improvements between these two periods.UK news in picturesGreat Britain\u0027s Jack Laugher and James Heatly pose with their Gold and Bronze medal\u0027s respectively won in the 1 metre springboard men\u0027s final at the European Diving Championships in GlasgowEngland cricketer Ben Stokes arrives at Bristol Crown Court accused of affray.

Now, that\u0027s all changedClick to followThe Independent USFace tattoos are no longer taboo and are sported by a growing number of internationally renowned celebritiesAt Chicago Tattoo \u0026amp Piercing Co., which has been in business in that city since 1973, the employees have a name for tattoos on the hands, neck and face. “We call them job stoppers,” said Joel Jose Molina, a tattoo artist at the shop. “Your possibilities are cut down. You’re going to be working at the Trader Joe’s putting groceries away or working that bar job.”Or then again, you might be cutting platinum albums and performing at this year’s Lollapalooza Festival, like Post Malone. Or broadcasting your amazing pop star life to your 101 million Instagram followers, like Justin Bieber.Both musicians have tattoos on their faces, a once taboo area to ink.Post Malone has “Stay Away” in curly script on his forehead and the words “Always” and “Tired” below each eye, while Bieber has a tiny, under-eye cross. Other artists with inked faces include 21 Savage (a knife on his forehead), Lil Xan (the words “xanarchy” and “candy,” the number “1996”), and Tekashi 6ix9ine, who was reportedly kidnapped and beaten last month (the number “69”, a red flower, the face of Jigsaw from the “Saw” movies).But marking one’s face isn’t limited to rappers, or men, or celebrities. Kat von D, the tattoo artist and model, has a wash of blue stars trailing down her forehead and cheek. Instagram, predictably, is filled with photos (#facetattoo) of people, most of them young, showing off their new face ink.For decades, tattoos in highly visible areas, especially the face, were considered the extreme in body art, at least in Western culture. It wasn’t only members of polite society who were put off. Even among tattoo aficionados, the face was sacrosanct, a canvas of last resort when the rest of the body was covered.Over his 12-year career, said Molina, 34, he has done only three face tattoos. “Two were on tattooers, and one was on this gangster from Florida who sold a bunch of weed and wanted his eyelid tattooed,” he said.Tattoos around the world featured in Needles \u0026amp Pins JonBoy, a New York-based tattoo artist who gave Bieber his cross and who has tattooed many other celebrities, half-joked that in the past, if he spotted someone with a face tattoo, “I’d walk on the other side of the street.”Indeed, one saw a face tat and thought: Aryan Brotherhood or gang member or sideshow performer. Famous face tattoo wearers of the recent past, like Mike Tyson, Charles Manson and the drug-addled skateboarder Jay Adams, conformed to the stereotype of the rough character.All of which makes their current popularity more striking — or perhaps not, at a time when tattoos have become ubiquitous.Anna Felicity Friedman, a scholar who runs the website Tattoo Historian, said that starting in the 1990s, it became common to see athletes and celebrities with tattoos. Soon, reality TV shows (with titles like “Best Ink” and “Tattoo Nightmares”) and magazines began covering tattoo culture, and Americans embraced body art like never before.Tattoos, as a result, began losing their renegade status. Hence the creep upward, past the neckline.“If you want to be transgressive — and a lot of rappers want to create a transgressive character — the last frontier is the face,” Friedman said. “Some of it is to give them a rebelcriminal allure. And some of it is a more artistic or free-spirit reference.”Post Malone has offered a simpler explanation to reporters for his face tattoos: anything to upset my mom. But with the notable exception of Lil Wayne and Wiz Khalifa, two heavily inked established artists, many of the hip-hop stars with face tattoos are so-called SoundCloud rappers — young, unknown artists who post their music on SoundCloud for free.Getting Anne Frank’s portrait etched on the side of your face, as the rapper and producer Arnoldisdead did, is one obvious way to attract attention.“A lot of kids are doing it to make themselves bigger on social media,” said Travis Hardy, 30, a creative director in Los Angeles who works with musicians. “It’s kind of corny.” Last month, he a got a lightning bolt tattooed under his left eye.“I don’t need that,” Hardy said, referring to others’ quest for attention. “This isn’t for followers or comments.” (Though there is, in fact, a thoughtfully composed shot on Hardy’s Instagram.)World news in picturesAn Israeli soldier rides an armoured vehicle during an army drill after the visit of Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, IsraelUsable items are salvaged from a home destroyed in an earthquake in North Lombok, Indonesia.

There’s no normal job or whatever,” Hardy said. “I’m going to continue to creative direct or write treatments for music videos or stage design. I’m not going to turn around. This served as a stamp: I believe in myself.”Hardy’s tattoo is so small as to be easily mistaken for a birthmark or go unnoticed in public. It is what JonBoy, who did the face tattoo, considers “classy.”Harder to miss is the tattoo that Kerwin Frost, a member of the Spaghetti Boys D.J. collective, has on his face: a realistic pencil that runs the entire length of his right cheek.The four most popular tattoo styles of 2018Mum warns of dangers of black henna after children scarredReactions to the pencil have been all over the map, Frost said. “Some people scream at me,” he said. “Some people also get super-angry because life is working out for me right now, so it’s, what can I call out? A lot of people really love it and ask me if I draw.”He has no regrets. “It’s honestly almost made my life better having it, not going to lie,” Frost said. And if at some point he wants it gone (as Gucci Mane appears to have done, erasing the ice cream cone tattoo off his face), laser removal technology has become better and more affordable.Still, don’t expect face tattoos to become commonplace anytime soon. Molina, the Chicago tattoo artist, says that those getting face tattoos are generally young and work in untraditional jobs. For what it’s worth, he has no plans to get one himself. “I know if I drop my kid off at school and I have face tattoos, the teacher is going to judge me,” he said.Echoing many in the tattoo community, Molina also believes that a face tattoo should never be someone’s first time getting inked. When an 18-year-old woman recently asked him for a tattoo on her ear, he saw she had no other visible tattoos and talked her out of it.“You have to earn it,” he said. “It’s a rite of passage.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://www.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/07/09/AFP-1837KK.jpg","title":"beijing olympics venues 2008 derelict athletics swimming","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe Independent Online19 Volleyball stadium in 2018This photo taken on July 23, 2018 shows rotting wood on a stand in the beach volleyball stadium built for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games29 Beach volleyball stadium in 2018A rundown athlete seating area in the beach volleyball stadium 39 Two of five 2008 Beijing Olympic Games mascotsThis photo taken on July 20, 2018 shows Nini (L) and Yingying, two of the five mascots, lying among trees behind an abandoned, never-completed mall in Beijing49 Corner of the BMX track in 2018This photo taken on July 18, 2018 shows trees and weeds growing on a banked corner of the BMX track 59 Corner of the BMX track in 2018This photo taken on July 18, 2018 shows trees and weeds growing on a banked corner of the BMX track 69 The finishing line of the BMX trackTrees and weeds growing at the finish line of the BMX track 79 Whitewater kayaking stadium in 2018The whitewater kayaking stadium is now no longer in use89 Whitewater kayaking stadium in 201899 Whitewater kayaking stadium in 2018A faded Olympic rings logo beside the whitewater kayaking stadium19 Volleyball stadium in 2018This photo taken on July 23, 2018 shows rotting wood on a stand in the beach volleyball stadium built for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games29 Beach volleyball stadium in 2018A rundown athlete seating area in the beach volleyball stadium 39 Two of five 2008 Beijing Olympic Games mascotsThis photo taken on July 20, 2018 shows Nini (L) and Yingying, two of the five mascots, lying among trees behind an abandoned, never-completed mall in Beijing49 Corner of the BMX track in 2018This photo taken on July 18, 2018 shows trees and weeds growing on a banked corner of the BMX track 59 Corner of the BMX track in 2018This photo taken on July 18, 2018 shows trees and weeds growing on a banked corner of the BMX track 69 The finishing line of the BMX trackTrees and weeds growing at the finish line of the BMX track 79 Whitewater kayaking stadium in 2018The whitewater kayaking stadium is now no longer in use89 Whitewater kayaking stadium in 201899 Whitewater kayaking stadium in 2018A faded Olympic rings logo beside the whitewater kayaking stadiumThe 2008 Beijing Olympics were hailed as a major success, with the venues\u0027\u0026nbsparchitecture\u0026nbsplauded across the world.\u0026nbspHowever, a\u0026nbspdecade on from the international sporting spectacular, new images of the once-proud venues show them deserted and in advanced states of decay and disrepair.\u0026nbspMetal has rusted, wood\u0026nbsprotted and watersport parks run completely dry.AFPGetty Images)AFPGetty Images)AFPGetty Images)Giant statues of mascots\u0026nbspNini,\u0026nbspYingjing\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspBeibei\u0026nbspcan be seen lying broken and abandoned on the ground.\u0026nbspThe two main venues, the “Bird\u0027s Nest” stadium and the “Water Cube” aquatics centre are still\u0026nbsppopular tourist attractions, however.\u0026nbspwhitewater kayaking stadium built for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games is now in disrepair (AFPGetty Images)The successful Beijing Olympics helped to boost the self-confidence of the Chinese leadership -

However, its oldest part, Westminster Hall, was built in 1099 and survived that fire and more recently bombing in the Second World War.The Hall\u0027s hammer beam roof is currently undergoing a major refurbishment, as is Parliament\u0027s probably most renowned feature, the Elizabeth Tower with its famous four-sided clockface housing the bell known as Big Ben.The tower is currently shrouded in scaffolding and Big Ben will ben silent until the project\u0027s planned end in 2021,\u0026nbsp except for important national events such as New Year\u0027s Eve and Remembrance Sunday.Brexiteers want the bell to chime on Brexit day next March 29 but have so far been rebuffed.

Labour MPs \u0026lsquoTERRIFIED\u0026rsquo of speaking out against Corbyn in fear of PURGEMr Austin\u0027s adoptive father was a Jewish refugee from the Nazis and the threat to investigate him for abusive conduct was thought to have been sparked by claims about a row with party chairman Ian Lavery.His lawyer\u0027s letter complained of a Kafkaesque process in which the MP had been told by Chief Whip Nick Brown there were other similar complaints against him and formally warned not to repeat such behaviour - but without Mr Austin being given details or a chance to defend himself.A Labour spokesman declined to comment on an ongoing investigation.Dame Margaret\u0027s confrontation with Mr Corbyn last month was over the leadership\u0027s refusal to adopt in full an international definition and examples of anti-Semitism.After Labour claimed on Monday she had expressed regret over the way she raised her view with Mr Corbyn, she firmly insisted there had been no apology on either side, with her lawyers telling Labour the party\u0027s briefing had misrepresented our client\u0027s discussions with the Chief Whip in a cynical attempt to save face in your necessary climbdown.According to a new index, the EU27 countries fall into three groups: hard-core, hard and soft.

That\u0026rsquos Germany, France and Italy.The intervention came after stunning revelations by leading international law expert Professor David Collins that the Chequers plan drawn up by controversial civil servant Olly Robbins could be illegal and needs to be ditched.Mr Hargreaves, who is a co-founder of the City analysts Hargreaves Lansdown, is the latest substantial figures to back a WTO solution.Earlier this week the  published evidence from Professor Patrick Minford, an advisor to Margaret Thatcher, that while WTO terms will cost the EU \u0026pound500 billion it will boost the British economy by \u0026pound600 billion.

And the amazing thing is they have never ever asked any of the people that really are great businessmen.They\u0027ve left it to civil servants and not one of them has done anything of any worth in their lives.Mr Hargreaves pointed out that British negotiators lack representation in government from those who backed the Leave campaign, especially after former Brexit secretary David Davis and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson quit.He also noted that Prime Minister Theresa May was a Remainer and we should have a team that want Brexit and want us out of the EU.Leave Means Leave co-chairman Richard Tice (Image: )He said: The best option is no deal. No deal would give us free trade with Europe because the three biggest economies in Europe, outside Britain, are huge exporters to the UK.That\u0027s Germany, France and Italy. And those three economies would absolutely demand free trade from the EU.I guarantee my entire wealth that we would get free trade.Leave Means Leave co-chairman Richard Tice, a high profile businessman in London, said that the intervention by a senior City figure supporting a World Trade Deal and no deal with the EU contrasted with the lightweight interventions from the Remainer camp who have been trying to stir up a new Project Fear.Scare stories over a no deal have included Britain not having sandwiches anymore and diabetics running out of insulin.Meanwhile, the facts of a no deal with the EU are that Britain gets to keep its \u0026pound39 billion orce bill as well as forge a more prosperous future free of EU rules and red tape.Mr Tice said: \u0026ldquoPeople should trust one of Britain\u0026rsquos most successful entrepreneurs, not Remain civil servants or politicians.Meanwhile, in his paper for Lawyers for Britain, Professor Collins claimed that the soft Brexit Chequers plan, which civil servants persuaded Mrs May to accept and has been criticised by Brexiteers, is illegal in international law.Theresa May laughed with Angela Merkel after meeting the German chancellor only hours after Brexit chaos resignations                    REUTERS1 of 15Theresa May has met Angela Merkel only hours after the Cabinet\u0027s Brexit turmoilThe plan led to Mr Johnson and Mr Davis resigning from the Cabinet and has led to concerns that the UK would be an \u0026ldquoEU colony with a common rulebook with Brussels tying it to rules made by a foreign power.Professor Collins, who is a Professor of International Economic Law at City Law School, focussed his criticism on a Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) proposal in the Chequers planHe said that the FCA procedure of collecting EU tariffs risks breaching the National Treatment Principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\u0026nbsp (GATT) Article III.1 because it \u0026ldquoimposes burdensome tracking obligations on imported goods which are not imposed on equivalent domestic products.Because the FCA would mean that there would be differing rules depending on the nationality of a product, it breaches WTO law.Speaking in Edinburgh yesterday, Mrs May defended her Chequers plan.She said: \u0026ldquoWe are working to get a good deal.\u0026ldquoWe have put forward a proposal that delivers on the Brexit vote that maintains, protects jobs and livelihoods here in the UK that will be good for the all parts of the United Kingdom.

Available only to the elite few who could afford them at first, they were designed purely to enable people to take a call while away from home.Fast forward a couple of decades and we are all glued to our devices, a nation of addicts.We are now so wedded to our smartphones that we check them every 12 minutes.The average Brit spends more than a day a week online, twice as long as ten years ago.This surge in time online is largely down to the rise of smartphones, which are now used by 78 per cent of the population compared with just 17 per cent in 2008.My personal bugbear is people who walk along the street in a slow zig-zag because they are glued to their phone.And there’s nothing worse than someone who interrupts a conversation to take a call or read a text.It surely can’t be a coincidence that, in the same week as this report was released, we hear about five-year-olds starting school unable to speak in sentences — partly, no doubt, down to parents plugging them into a screen rather than talking or reading to them.I’ve got a Blackberry, mainly because I like the keyboard. But I am probably as hooked on it as the next person.It’s an invaluable tool for anyone wanting to work flexibly. But I also do a fair amount of pointless surfing on it.I’m not into all forms of social media, but I am a bit of a news junkie and I’ll confess I also watch the odd funny YouTube film with my kids.Unfortunately, progress in technology has brought the idea that we “should” all be available 24/7.In fact, people are quite indignant if you don’t reply to an email within the hour — even if it’s sent at 4am.Being a conscientious type, the result for me if I’m not careful, is that if I wake up in the night I’ll check my emails and maybe even reply to a few before going back to sleep. Now that can’t be good for the old circadian rhythms.The other problem with everyone being always available and always “on” is that our FOMO — fear of missing out — has increased exponentially.We’re all terrified that if we’re offline for too long we won’t get to . . . what exactly? See photos of someone’s hashtag perfect holibobs with the famalam — and then feel like our life is rubbish by comparison?I use Twitter a bit but I avoid Facebook and Instagram, partly because I don’t want the possibility that the opinions and “likes” of people I don’t know may influence me more than my own values and views.And another problem with the prevalence of tech is that we don’t have any down time.All those previously blank moments — on the bus, waiting for our microwave meal to cook, lying in bed at night — have all become an opportunity to surf, tweet, and message. We are going to burn out if we aren’t careful.I always know when I’m really relaxed because I accidentally go out without my phone.Granted, it generally only happens when I’m on holiday.But now I know how close we are to becoming actual addicts, I feel like we should all build in some time away from our devices.After all, the more time we spend looking at a screen, the less time we spend looking at the world and engaging with other people.So maybe we should all take a moment to leave our phone at home, go for a walk, and switch from “on” to “off”.Isn’t that a liberating thought?I’M sure a fair few people felt a bit guilty reading about the Vogue interview with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie this week.The sisters talk about how hard it is living in the public eye but also the criticism and mockery they face, often attacked for taking too many holidays.Who knows, perhaps some of that criticism is justified.But a lot of the comments they get are about their appearance and clothes – and that is where it crosses a line.No-one chooses the family into which they are born, and they are trying to make the best of the hand they’ve been given.They are trying to build careers and have a personal life while being in the public eye and that can’t be easy.I hope people realise that and give them a break.HAVING spent the past couple of decades getting annoyed at anyone who utters the words “Poor Jennifer Aniston”, this week, for the first time ever, I said them myself.You know why?Because the 49-year-old has been forced to publicly address, again, the tedious topic of why she hasn’t had a baby.She also alluded to something no woman should have to share with anyone they don’t want to, let alone the world – the fact she might be medically unable to procreate.Poor Jen. She can’t just get on with her very successful – and no doubt happy – life without being plagued by speculation.In the same interview she took the chance to spell it out: Just because she split from Justin Theroux doesn’t mean her life is over.She might even be happy to have finally got shot of him.“The misconceptions are ‘Jen can’t keep a man’,” she said. “And ‘Jen refuses to have a baby because she’s selfish and committed to her career.’ Or that I’m sad and heartbroken . . . first, with all due respect, I’m not heartbroken. And second, those are reckless assumptions.“No one knows what’s going on behind closed doors. No one considers how sensitive that might be for my partner and me. They don’t know what I’ve been through medically or emotionally.“There is a pressure on women to be mothers, and if they are not, then they’re deemed damaged goods. Maybe my purpose on this planet isn’t to procreate. Maybe I have other things I’m supposed to do.”So yes. Poor, poor Jen being under the world’s watchful and pitying eye all the time.Just to remind people. Jennifer Aniston is one of the world’s most successful stars.She has a big group of friends and a beautiful home, which she bought herself. She has dogs she adores, she’s funny, busy, and fulfilled.But all of that is worth nothing, of course. She doesn’t have kids.To anyone reading this who thinks women must have children to be fulfilled, please take note: Plenty of women don’t want to get married or have kids.Many other women want kids but can’t have them.And guess what? It’s none of our business.Here’s another way of looking at Jennifer’s life. She is lucky.She gets to please herself and hasn’t had to make any of the sacrifices that many of us make to become mothers.Also, George Clooney didn’t meet Amal until he was 51. Hugh Grant got married this year at 57 (after many failed relationships). Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, and Jude Law, 45, are still single and dating. Has anyone ever said: “Poor George/Hugh/Leonardo/Jude”?Of course they haven’t. So let’s stop saying it about Jennifer, too.I SO related to Carol Vorderman’s delight at being asked for proof of age when she bought some wine at M\u0026ampS recently.When you’re young, being asked to prove your age, as the presenter, above, was is very annoying. But as time goes by it’s one of life’s little victories.Having said that, this hasn’t happened to me in Aldi. Maybe I ought to go to M\u0026ampS!I’M truly appalled by the news that the Home Office “turns a blind eye” to the plight of British teenagers who are being forced to marry abroad, then raped and impregnated – after which the ministerial department actually hands a visa to their husbands.These young British women in question are forced abroad, or told they are going on holiday, but in reality are forced into a marriage and to get pregnant so that they can apply for a UK visa for their “husband”.Officials received dozens of reports last year that women wanted to block visas for men they had been made to marry in countries including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates.But in almost half of their cases the visas were approved nonetheless! And experts believe that there are thousands more victims who are too afraid to come forward.The women forced into this situation must be absolutely terrified, not least because their own family is complicit in this abuse.The authorities when granting the visa do not actually speak to the “wife”. There is no whistle-blowing process or opportunity for the women to make a confidential statement. Any statement made is public.Authorities fear that if they block the visa they will be called racists, but this is a safeguarding issue and that fear of causing offence really has to stop.We need to get on top of the problem by working with schools to raise awareness, so girls know how to report it.And we need to work with social workers so they can recognise the family members are the perpetrators of this crime.GOSH, how shocking is the video footage of a woman called Arabella Juniper Torres calling the police to report a woman, who happened to be black, for sheltering in her doorway in Brooklyn, New York, while waiting for her Uber?We are living in the age of the death of the Good Samaritan.I helped someone carry a pushchair downstairs at the Tube last week – as all the burly men walked past, I might add.She was so grateful it made me realise small acts of kindness have all but disappeared. How about this for an idea: let’s all try to be kind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And how did they get so sick that they believe their behaviour is socially acceptable?These women-hating bullies — Liam Holmes, 20, who battered a woman to the ground outside Faces nightclub, and the five smirking thugs who tormented a vulnerable woman but can’t be named because they are under 18 — are not the products of brutal, inner-city gangland.These blights on the face of British manhood are the product of ordinary homes, God help us.They are what our young men look like now.They are not feral kids who never had a chance.They are not the products of deprived lives.The leering bullies posing proudly around their terrified victim in that sun-drenched park are growing up in Bury St Edmunds, a peaceful Suffolk market town with pretty cottages and a lovely cathedral, while Liam Holmes attacked his victim outside a club that was once a fashionable oasis for footballers and pop stars, the Essex answer to New York’s Studio 54.These thugs all have dear old mums who love them to bits.Indeed, the mother of one of the park scum sacks — a woman who must have an IQ lower than her dress size — complained that her son was the one suffering now because the backlash has ruined his 16th birthday.The poor little lamb! What’s the world coming to if you and your mates can’t torture a vulnerable middle-aged woman in the park any more?Personally, I hope the backlash ruins his life.And while we ponder these pitiful excuses for young men, let us spare a thought for their female victims.The 18-year-old woman who was punched to the ground by Liam Holmes has been predictably abused in the sewer of social media, informed “she deserved it” for daring to speak back to a man, and gloatingly told that, “she had a lesson in true equality.Meanwhile the vulnerable 49-year-old woman who was brutalised in the park has spoken with incredible restraint about her experience, which must have been as humiliating as it was frightening.“Considering the respective ages of all parties and that it was five or six young men versus me alone, I remain surprised that they behaved in such a way towards me,” she said.“I would like to hear their reasons, if possible.”Which is so mild-mannered that I find it breaks my bloody heart.It is tempting to blame the surge in violence against women on social media, and brainless morons like the little d**ks in that park taking pictures to show off to their mates. But it can’t all be blamed on social media.I bet Liam Holmes wishes there were no cameras around when he was smashing a woman in the jaw.“He wouldn’t do that for no reason,” protests his mother Cathy, 53. “There was a lot that went on before that people don’t know about.”Sorry, there can never be an excuse, reason or justification for a man or boy to abuse a woman or girl. Not ever.The old taboo about men being violent towards women should still stand.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they say something cutting to you at chucking out time.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they have the insolent cheek to sit on the park bench where you like to hang out with your bad-ass homies in the Bury St Edmunds massive.How hard is it to understand?Men should not be violent towards women.My father, the hardest man I ever met, taught me a real man does not raise his voice to a woman, let alone his hand.But that generation of tough, gentle men has gone and in their place we have pitiful excuses for the male of the species who feel empowered by belittling, beating and abusing women.And what sickens the stomach about the boys in the park is that they all look so very pleased with themselves, as if tormenting a vulnerable woman who, in the words of her stepmother “wouldn’t say boo to a goose” is the high point of their miserable lives.It is a good job their mothers all love them because I can’t imagine any other self-respecting woman ever will.“He’s never had a girlfriend,” someone remarked of woman-bashing lout, Liam Holmes.Yes, it shows. The big close-up Nicole posted on Instagram is absolutely terrifying. What a scary face! The spider, I mean. Not Nicole.HOW sweet life was for Jeremy Corbyn when he was a loopy left-wing backbencher, free to flutter his eyelashes at the IRA, to stand on platforms that compared Israel to Nazi Germany and to bowl up on Iranian TV praising the release of Hamas terrorists who had murdered Jewish children.But now fate has Corbyn as a possible Prime Minister his support of extremism is not such a good look.And no matter how pathetic this Tory Government becomes, no matter how timid, weak and gutless Theresa May looks in the face of Brussels’ bullying, the British people will never choose for Prime Minister a man who considers the child killers in Hamas to be his “brothers”.“In the past, in the pursuit of peace and justice for the Palestinian people, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject,” apologises panicky Corbyn, a man who can feel the keys to 10 Downing Street slipping through his fingers.The past is coming back to haunt Jeremy Corbyn.And it will destroy him.It might also have something to do with the celeb fear of looking like a sweaty idiot with two left feet, while wearing nipple-crushing Lycra on prime-time television.Luckily, Nadiya Bychkova, above, will be there for her second series, the only pro dancer who looks more like a celebrity than any of the celebrities.THOSE who want the UK to remain in the European Union have never made any attempt to persuade the 17.4million who voted to leave to change our minds.They just insult us.Peter Mandelson says Brexiteers “hate other countries and hate foreigners” while Stewart Lee, a pot-bellied Bernard Manning for snowflakes, says: “It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe – c**** did as well. Stupid f****** c****.”Just insults.Which is why Remain lost the referendum. And why they would lose 100 referendums.BAKE Off winner Nadiya Hussain tells Loose Women: “I work in an industry that is heavily dominated by male, middle-class, middle-aged men and there’s no space for a 5ft brown girl, who wears a headscarf.”But you became a national treasure, Nadiya.So self-pity is misplaced.MADONNA turns 60 years old on August 16 and has marked the birthday by laying provocatively on the ground sporting suspenders, lacy bra and a been-to-bed expression in her half-closed eyes.The Material Girl still looks great, of course.Mind you, she does look as though she might need a hand getting back on her feet. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fine. But this leopard is not about to change his spots.Throughout his life he has shown terrible judgment. It is extraordinary how often he picks the wrong side.He is not just a threat to British Jews if he gets into power.He’s a threat to Britain, full stop.BRUSSELS bureaucrats always put their precious project ahead of common sense.It explains their approach to Brexit negotiations.Yet our analysis of what a ‘no deal’ Brexit would mean for French pharmaceutical companies, German car manufacturers and everything in between should focus minds.You can’t just find £500 billion down the back of the sofa, Jean-Claude.The Brexit Department has its own detailed study too, but are keeping it private. That should change.Let’s see if unleashing ‘Project Fear’ on the Continent helps our negotiating hand.THE death of Elsie Scully-Hicks is a heart-breaking tragedy.But our revelation today of a potential conflict of interest at the heart of the Vale of Glamorgan Council shows there are still serious questions to answer.There should be no stone unturned.We must ensure that nothing like this can ever happen again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And they provide unconditional love for millions.Now, leading dog charities have warned that the consumption of dog meat here is on the rise.This sick trend cannot continue.Campaigners are calling on the Government to outlaw it.But it is horrifying that this is not already the case.America will enact legislation next month to make it illegal there.Our Government must do the same.THE Thomas Markle debacle cannot continue.How can Kensington Palace’s PR team think that forever snubbing him will help?It is about time something gave to stop this sad situation worsening.Prince Harry should step in to help orchestrate a positive resolution.The stress on Meghan, who is trying to adjust to life in Britain, is very unfair.IT is almost 40 years since Linda Lusardi first modelled for The Sun — becoming our most popular Page Three girl ever.Now, as she prepares to mark her 60th birthday, she has returned to her roots with a stunning new photo shoot.Like Madonna, who is about to reach the same milestone, she is proving age is nothing but a number.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only whites qualify.For decades, the likes of Harriet Harman have led the crusade for equality, attacking men as oppressors and demanding — rightly — that women must be protected from abuse.Harman famously refuses even to endorse marriage as the best foundation for raising a family, let alone as a good thing in itself, a public commitment.Yet she and the overwhelming majority of virtue- signalling Labour MPs are silent, for instance, on the treatment of some Muslim women by some Muslim men.I can’t recall a Labour street protest against forced ­marriage or honour killings even though they are commonplace here and reprehensible in any society. Even the Home Office feels cowed when dealing with victims.Indeed, Labour turned on its own brave MP Sarah Champion for daring to raise the issue of rampant sex-trafficking by “mainly Pakistani men”.On the Left, racism trumps rape. Now, like the “F-word”, it has become the reach-for term of abuse applied to any debate — including the issue of Britain leaving the European Union.Opposition to the EU’s ­corrupt and undemocratic “Grand Projet” long precedes the uncontrolled mass immigration unleashed by Labour.Illegal immigration is simply another symptom of EU “we know best” arrogance — personified by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet preposterous Tory MP Anna “Suck-It-Up” Soubry routinely slurs 17.4million referendum voters as “racist”.It is the mantra of all those who see Brexit voters — more than half the country — as thick and nasty.Odious Peter Mandelson joined in last week, avoiding the “R-word” but ludicrously accusing anyone who wants to leave the EU of “hating foreigners”, which is the same thing.“Nationalism is a hatred of foreigners,” says the slippery Euro peer. “They should not be confused with patriots.”“I voted Remain in the referendum though I entirely respect the contrary view of many others.”Mandy’s relationship with the truth has always been flaky, but this is pure cant.Even those who once worked alongside Lord Mandelson when Labour still stood for something are appalled.Ex-Home Secretary and fellow Remainer David Blunkett snapped yesterday: “The allegation that some of those voting for Leave were ‘racist’ is not a new one.“It has been bandied about and seems to me not only an insult to the many people that I used to represent who voted Leave, but also to utterly miss the point of why the majority of British people voted the way they did.“If we fail to understand, then we do ourselves, but crucially also our democracy, a great disservice.”Lord Blunkett also slammed Mandy’s call for a second referendum.He is right. It is now clear the mood has hardened against bullying Brussels.The EU’s own snide insinuations that voters here are racist “Little Englanders” has not helped.Bank of England boss Mark Carney, architect of Project Fear, sank the Pound last week by claiming chances of a clean-break Brexit were “uncomfortably high”.Trade Secretary Liam Fox warns the odds are now 60-40 against a deal.Remainers should understand that every gratuitous insult to the intelligence of decent British voters is another nail in Theresa May’s chances of a friendly ­negotiated settlement.McDonnell, cleverer than Corbyn, wants to stop Labour being dragged into what deputy leader Tom Watson calls a “vortex of eternal shame”. But McDonnell, too, is stained by anti-Jewish sentiment.In any case, Britain needs Jeremy Corbyn – to remain in place as the sullen figurehead of a blinkered Marxist rabble and remind voters what they are risking at the next election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those being treated for an attempted overdose rose more than ten-fold — from 249 in 1997 to 2,736.As far as I am concerned, social media is almost entirely responsible.In a world where everyone relies on their phones for everything, there has never been a more worrying time for mental health.To be a teenage girl in this day and age is to be never alone — and always lonely.They are spending day after day wading through airbrushed photos of images society has deemed perfect.Whether it is a member of the Kardashian family posing with a diet pill, a boob job advert in the middle of Love Island or a photo of a friend with whitened teeth and smooth skin, our screens are filled with how we can be better — with how we SHOULD be better.Jon Goldin is vice chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists.He  said recently: “There are a range of factors putting pressure on young children — academic pressure, exam pressure, social media . . . with fear of missing out and comparing yourself unfavourably to images you see online.“If you look at social media, my hunch is that girls are probably more sensitive to some of those factors than boys.”Although suicide is still the biggest killer of men under 45, awareness of this is at an all-time high. Hospital admissions for self-harm in boys, while still too high (2,236 last year), are stable.There was a campaign (which I took part in) two weeks ago that went viral on Instagram as people were asked to signal that they were OK as a means of opening a conversation on mental health.It is a conversation that desperately needs to be had.Despite massive steps to raise awareness, not least the Royal Family getting behind the Heads Together campaign for last year’s London Marathon, the internet — and young girls’ place in it — still needs a lot of talking about.I was lucky. Instagram was only invented when I was 16 and it did not matter a jot that I did not start using it until I was 18. Although we had social media, it was in its infancy, and I am incredibly grateful for that. My phone played a very small part in my life as a teenager.24% of girls are depressed by age 1480,000 UK kids suffer from severe depression90% of teen girls unhappy with their bodies70% of young people have been cyber-bulliedAs I went through the trials of being a young, insecure girl at school, negative thoughts were not able to follow me home. I would say goodbye to the bitching at 3.30pm and eat bangers and mash with my siblings without a thought for the girls in my class — no pinging from my phone to create waves of anxiety.These days that is simply not an option.Every issue that every teenager has ever faced is magnified to an extraordinary level with the advancement of technology.But removing phones from our daughters is simply not an option. Telling a teenager they can not have the internet is to tell them they can not have friends.Ten years ago a teenage friendship could withstand a summer holiday of no contact, but now a weekend with no signal, a Tuesday night with no Instagram story, makes kids hyperventilate.To be offline is to be forgotten. It is not showing up to the only party. The party that is going on all day and, more worryingly, all night too.Self-harm is, more often than not, a cry for help.As the internet forces its way into every corner of our lives, I cannot help but feel that it is a cry for human attention for affectionate, real-life attention.Warning signs  include if a child starts talking about themself in terms of failure or if there is a  change in their eating or sleeping patterns.Try asking  open-ended questions and do not give up if they are reluctant to  respond.Do not ban social media but set a good example and do activities away from it together.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans (free) on 116 123.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM has — finally — started to talk to them with a concrete plan.The silence after her meeting with Emmanuel Macron is concerning, but the noises from German business leaders and politicians from the Continent in recent weeks are more promising.As the clock ticks, it’s time for them to tell Brussels that the theatrics and the anti-Britain briefings have to end. The Chequers fudge is not perfect. But Brussels would be mad to knock it back.And if they do? Planning is already stepping up for a clean-break Brexit.The PM still believes no deal is better than a bad deal and insists she’s ready to walk away.And that, as President Trump knows, is The Art Of The Deal…AND so another new front opens up in the war against the motorist.It’s outrageous that companies in some parts of the country could be charged if their employees drive to work.Those firms, who have already paid business rates for having a car park, will just pass on the extra cost to workers. Another stealth tax, another pocket emptied.We wouldn’t mind so much if we believed the money would be ploughed back into the roads, getting rid of potholes and fixing rocky road surfaces. Or if the trains turned up when they’re supposed to.But we won’t hold our breath.POLICE unions never fail to complain about overwork and stress on the job.We can understand why. It’s not an easy job.

Cloverdale Ave, Mid-Wilshire.The property was once the garage and loft space of the house and was recently renovated and put up for rent at $3,950 (£3,000) a month - roughly ten times more than Doria would have paid 30 years ago.Despite their split, Meghans parents remained on good terms and on Fridays, straight after school, Meghan would join her father where he worked on the set of Married With Children.He could also afford to keep sending her to private nursery Little Red Schoolhouse, where previous pupils included the likes of Elizabeth Taylor.Doria, who had met Thomas while working as a make-up artist, was by now running a gift shop called Distant Treasures and a clothing store named A Change Of Dress.She ran the businesses, both at the same location, for 14 years - until she went bankrupt in 2009.The property, in a run-down shopping precinct, has since been turned into an aquarium which also houses a booze shop and kosher market.In 1990, Thomas scooped over £500,000 in a lottery, which comfortably paid Meghan’s fees at Immaculate Heart High School – one of LA’s finest – where she was the star of school productions.She moved into his ground floor apartment on Vista Del Mar Avenue, which had two tiny bedrooms with bars across the window, but has since been renovated.It made sense for her to live with her father during the week, according to Mortons book, and she stayed there until she was 17.Meghan went on to the prestigious Northwestern University in Illinois, where she studied theatre and international relations.Briefly she considered a career in politics, but the bright lights of showbiz proved too much to resist.It was during one of her visits back home to LA that she met film producer Trevor Engelson in a bar.Morton wrote: When Meghan first met him on that night out in West Hollywood, she liked what she saw and was attracted to his passion, drive, and ambition.She moved into his home behind notorious club Whisky A Go-Go on Sunset Strip, where Engleson still lives today, and after seven years of dating the pair married on a Jamaican beach in front of 100 guests.For years she landed nothing but bit-parts in shows like Knight Rider and CSI, and she appeared as “suitcase girl number 24” on Deal or No Deal.In one movie her character did not even have a name – she appeared in the credits simply as Hot Girl.She once put it: “I wasn’t black enough for the black roles and I wasn’t white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn’t book a job.”Then in 2011, shortly after a walk-on role as a FedEx delivery girl in movie Horrible Bosses, she landed her big break as Rachel Zane in Suits.She relocated to Toronto for filming but the couples long-distance relationship floundered and she divorced Engleson two years later.While working on Suits, she lived in a rented house in the Seaton Village neighbourhood of the Canadian city.Meghan shot to fame on the hit US series and in just five years, reinvented herself from struggling actress to the ultimate female role model as she used her high-profile to pursue political passions.She meet Prince Harry in 2016 following a blind date set up by a mutual friend and got engaged a year later.Meghan announced she was retiring from acting soon after and made the big move over the pond to live in London with her fiancee.The pair tied the knot at Windsor Castle in May this year and she now boasts a royal title and lives in a  two-bed cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425132515.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"12 labour mps in secret plot to oust jeremy corbyn hold secret summit at farmhouse and plot how to take back control","story":"Sources told the  that a gang of around 12 MPs have been holding secret away days to discuss how to take back control of the party.A group of them are reported to have caught the same 7.18am train from Waterloo East on a Thursday night to Stonegate, before getting a taxi to the luxury estate, Fair Oak Farm, in Sussex.The fightback has been taking place at the £144-a-night grade II listed farmhouse, built in the 1600s.The paper claims the attendees were a string of moderate MPs, including former leadership candidate Liz Kendall, and former shadow cabinet members Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie.Meetings are said to have taken place in other locations too - and a potential rebel list of more than 20.The reports come as Jeremy Corbyn is still desperately fighting to get a grip on the anti-Semitism crisis engulfing his own party.A source at the meetings told the : “We are getting together regularly to discuss how to take back control of the party.“At some point the Corbyn leadership is going to fail and collapse, we only need to see what is happening with the anti-Semitism problem, and we need to be ready to step in, win the leadership, rebuild the party as a credible force and repair the damage that has been done.”Another attendee at the away days told the Express: “As things stand Labour could win the next election simply because the Tories have made such a mess over Brexit and look so incompetent.“If that happens we will break away and either form a separate Labour Party within parliament or a new party.“There are [Remainer] Conservative and Lib Dem MPs who are interested in joining us if we do form a new party because of Brexit.”The MP added: “The issue would be then whether we would have time to create a proper identity before an election or if there would need to be an election soon after. In that sense it is complicated.”But Corbyn-critic Stephen Kinnock, who was also said to have attended the away day, said he could not recall the meeting.He said: “Hand on heart I have no clue about that. If such meetings are taking place I have yet to receive an invitation!”And Mr Leslie insisted the meetings were about policy development.He said: I meet with colleagues all the time, mostly in Parliament but sometimes its good to get out of Westminster. We had a really positive policy discussion and I very much appreciated the opportunity. I cant recall Jeremy Corbyn featuring in the discussion at all.A source close to Mr Corbyn played down the plotting, saying: “Labour isn’t about to fall back into the hands of out-of-touch career politicians who support cuts and back foreign wars, no matter how many fancy away days they hold.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425272314-e1533644666479.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tourist blasts venice cafe for charging him 38 for two coffees and two waters but owner blames him for sitting outside","story":"Juan Carlos Bustamente, 62, from Chile, was shocked when he got the bill at Caffe Lavena, which sits on the edge of the iconic St Marks Square.The coffee he enjoyed in the square, known locally as Piazza San Marco, was around ten times the general price of a hot drink in the area.He was charged £10.30 for each coffee and £8.90 for an individual 25cl bottle of water.The furious Chilean posted a picture of the receipt on Facebook with the message: I dont know what you think but 43 euros for two coffees and two bottles of water!The post quickly went viral, with one person saying: This is theft.

A separate plan details a two week outright ban followed by six weeks of restrictions.It’s the first significant sign of No Deal planning by the Home Office – despite repeated calls for the Government to do more to shore up Britain’s borders.Critics claim a No Deal will spark huge queues at ports due to explosion in physical checks on goods and people entering the UK.Lucy Moreton of the Immigration Services Union said staff were “paying the price” for their woeful lack of preparation by the Government and Border Force over the past two years.The Home Office is recruiting some 300 extra Border Force staff for Brexit – but union leaders claims TEN TIMES as many are required.Ms Moreton stormed: “Beleaguered staff who already have had to give up summer family holidays may now be asked to give up Easter holidays as well just to paper over the gaps caused by years of under investment.“We have repeatedly warned Border Force of the need for far greater preparation in case of the catastrophic impact of a No Deal.“Now our members are paying the price.”A No Deal effectively means all existing agreements and alliances with the EU end overnight on March 29.Leaked documents last week suggested the Home Office may allow EU citizens to enter the UK without checks in the event of a No Deal because Border Force doesn’t have the capacity to cope.It currently takes 45 seconds to check an EU citizens’ passport compared to an average four minutes for someone from the rest of the world.But non-EU tourists have faced huge delays of up to 3.5 hours at Heathrow this summer as staffing shortages cause huge tailbacks at border control.A Home Office spokesman last night said: “We have made significant progress in negotiations and are confident of securing a deal with the EU.“However it is the duty of any responsible government to prepare for every eventuality, including the unlikely scenario that we reach March 2019 without agreeing a deal.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This period is a blip in our history.“We will overcome this.”The incendiary comments - that threaten another huge backlash from ‘Corbynistas’ - came as a second Labour MP suspended in the anti-Semitism row threatened legal action.Lawyers acting for Ian Austin – a former Labour minister – said the investigation into the MP was a “farce and a disgrace” and an attempt to silence “legitimate criticism”.The row was sparked last month when Labour’s ruling body approved a new anti-Semitism code condemned by the Jewish community for watering down the internationally recognised IHRA definition.Mr Austin condemned the move in a tirade at party chair Ian Lavery – triggering disciplinary action. At the same time Margaret Hodge branded Jeremy Corbyn an “anti-Semite”.Labour ended an investigation into Dame Margaret on Monday claiming she had “expressed regret” - a claim she immediately denied.Mr Corbyn faced fresh humiliation as footage from an interview with Iranian TV in 2011 showed the Labour leader appearing to question Israel’s right to exist.He accused the Israeli Government and Israeli Embassy of pressurising the BBC into defending it.And UK experts who helped draw up the IHRA code condemned Labour by saying any “modified” version of its ‘gold standard’ code would allow attacks on Jews to go “unaddressed”.In a withering attack, the UK delegation of the global watchdog said any “modified” version of its gold standard would leave attacks on the Jewish community “unaddressed”.While not naming Labour, the seven UK academics said they were issuing the statement in light of the recent “discourse” on anti-Semitism.Labour’s ruling NEC body triggered the bitter row last month by approving plans for its own anti-Semitism code – which critics claim has dropped four of the 11 examples listed by the IHRA.In their statement, the UK experts said: “Any ‘modified’ version of the IHRA definition that does not include all of its 11 examples is no longer the IHRA definition.Adding or removing language undermines the months of international diplomacy and academic rigour that enabled this definition to exist.We would once again revert to a world where antisemitism goes unaddressed simply because different entities cannot agree on what it is.”Labour MP Wes Streeting – co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for British Jews – said it was time for the Labour leadership to “swallow its pride” and accept the IHRA definition in full. He said: “I think this demonstrates conclusively that any individuals or organisations including the Labour Party cannot cherry pick the bits that they like from the IHRA definition and disregard others. “I think after a summer of utter misery for the Labour party over its failure to tackle anti-Semitism it’s time for the leadership to swallow its pride and acknowledge they have got this badly wrong.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The agenda is only expected to be determined at the beginning of September.”UK officials said they stood by their assertion Mr Kurz “confirmed” to the PM that Brexit would be added to the Salzburg agenda.Downing Street insisted the Austrian leader had made the pledge at a meeting with Mrs May on July 27.When Liam Fox described the EU and the Continent’s political leaders as “intransigent” at the weekend, they hopped up and down with righteous indignation at the supposed insult. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s just not attractive.I’ve a friend who simply cannot imagine why any woman in the world wouldn’t desire him.Consequently, many women do desire him. I, on the other hand, simply cannot imagine why any woman would desire me. Consequently, they invariably don’t. But because I knew they wouldn’t, I’m not remotely downhearted.I’ve kept the company of positive people over the years. They have their uses. But expecting me to believe them when they say, “Don’t worry, it’ll all be fine”, is fanciful.And believing that from professional advisers can be absolutely calamitous.“Oh yes, Adrian, it’s all going to be fine.” And then, whatever it is, turns out not to be fine and they just shrug and say, “Oh dear, didn’t see that coming, pay me some more fees and I’ll make sure it’ll be all right in the end.”In my work as a journalist I’ve talked to many psychologists who speak of the power of positive thinking. Yeah, whatever. Maybe. But what I do know for sure is that I just can’t do it.When you’re standing on a golf course with a club in your hand addressing the ball, you’re supposed to envisage your perfect shot. For me, impossible.What I actually envisage, with complete clarity, is a truly dreadful shot.I can actually hear the ball smacking on to trees, or plopping into water. I’m living in the calamity.So at least when it happens, which is often, I can shrug and say, “Hmm, thought so.”All this may stem from supporting a team like West Bromwich Albion. I once told a priest, in all seriousness, that I suffered from deep despondence.When he asked me why I thought this was, I told him (as a joke) who I supported. He nodded gravely and said, “Yes, I see, I see.”I have a friend I travel with on the supporters’ coaches to away matches. The poor chap always thinks we’re going to win. Even at 2-0 down at half-time he’ll be sure we’ll emerge victorious.I challenged him once about these absurd delusions and he said: “Look, we all have the same journey home after a game. If we’ve won we’re both happy, if we lose we’re both sad. The difference is that I’ve had a much more enjoyable journey there than you.”That convinced me for a while. So the next game I tried being positive.And we lost. And it hurt more. So I went back to how I was.There’s only one route to happiness I can think of and it’s to be found in the lyrics of a song by the late Mose Allison: “I don’t worry ’bout a thing, ’cos I know nothing’s going to be alright.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in those days — the late Seventies — it was rare and unrecognised.We lost touch a long time ago, but I thought of Sarah this week when I read that the number of teenage girls self-harming has doubled in the past 20 years.According to new NHS data, the number of hospital admissions for girls who have self-harmed has jumped from 7,327 in 1997 to 13,463 last year. For boys, the figures have stayed almost the same — from 2,236 then to 2,332 now.Worse, “self-poisoning” — as in taking an overdose — is rising for both genders and last month the Government released a green paper that said around 850,000 children and young people now have a diagnosable mental health condition.Experts say academic pressure is a contributory factor, so too social media.Kids have always had exams to cope with but in the old days jealous and bitter remarks were confined to the dark corners of secret conversations or, at worst, scrawled on a toilet wall.Now these brave warriors have a keyboard and pseudonym behind which they can troll you for everyone to see.By my age, you know the vitriol probably comes from a bitter, 53-year-old virgin who lives in his mother’s spare bedroom. But when you’re still finding your way in the world, that poisonous undermining can worm its way inside your head and chip away at the confidence that acts as an armour in life.One self-harmer told me the pain of cutting his skin provided a welcome distraction from the “washing machine” rotations of negative thoughts constantly disturbing his peace of mind.The majority of them can be helped if it is spotted early enough and the expert assistance they need is then easy to access. And therein lies the problem.In 2016, Theresa May said the mental health of children was to be one of her priorities as PM, but since then Brexit has taken over and little has changed.The Government’s strategy is to train more teachers to spot the signs, appoint 7,000 more specialists to child mental health units and cut the waiting time for non-critical cases to be seen.But even if it happens, it won’t be enough.Parents must also remain vigilant for any marked change in their child’s personality or behaviour and the big social media companies have the technology to stop the majority of trolls — so they should be forced to use it.If all of the above doesn’t happen, the NHS has another mental health time bomb coming which will cost the taxpayer a fortune and have an even greater cost to the mental well-being of the next generation.WHEN TV baker Paul Hollywood started dating a 23-year-old barmaid from his local pub, they were quick to point out that their relationship only started after his marriage to wife Alex ended.But Alex is reportedly not buying this explanation and is planning to name Summer Monteys-Fullam in her £10million divorce battle.Whatever the truth, it remains the case that many couples conveniently consider only full sexual intercourse as adultery.But of course, cosy chats, lingering touches and come-hither looks are all it takes for any man with a wandering eye to recognise that, should he wish to jump ship, there’s a shiny new model waiting in the wings to rev up his sex life.Hallelujah for the wonderfully pragmatic Emma Thompson who, when asked about her marriage to the dreamily handsome Greg Wise, replied that they have had plenty of rough times.The secret to a happy relationship, she says, is the realisation that there will be unhappy times and that, if you manage to amble through to the other side: “It’s always better.”She adds: “I think people in long, happy marriages tell a lot of fibs, like, ‘Yes, it’s been marvellous’, whereas I say, ‘Sometimes it has been awful’.”If a relationship is deeply unhappy for a sustained period then, of course, get the hell out.But in these Tinder times of endlessly sweeping left in search of the “perfect” mate (who doesn’t exist) it’s invaluable when someone high profile points out that, more often than not, sticking with the one you’ve got works out in the end.Altogether now, “Love is a decision, not just a feeling.”Daisy-May Demetres smile lights up a room.Just eight years old, she was born without her lower legs and now uses two prosthetic blades that allow her to live as full a life as possible.She attends mainstream school, loves PE and has just been given a modelling contract with high street brand River Island.Yet, because of her disability, her parents Alex and Claire admit to feeling a “profound sadness” the day she was born and asked themselves what they had done wrong. And when, as a toddler, Daisy-May had to endure a painful, eight-hour operation on her stumps, Alex admits he turned to alcohol and gambling in a bid to numb his feelings of hopelessness.But by the time she was four, Daisy-May had mastered her blades and was doing cartwheels and headstands.Alex, 35, from Birmingham, says: “I looked at her and thought, ‘If you can achieve so much, against all the odds, and still be cheerful, then I have no reason at all to be depressed’. I stopped gambling and drinking that day.”While no one would wish disability on their child, the Demetres’ story is a salutary lesson that, sometimes, what seems like insurmountable adversity through an adult’s eyes can, through a child’s simple acceptance and joie de vivre, enrich your life and give it deeper meaning.Following a cyber attack in Alaska, government officials have abandoned their computers and taken to using old-fashioned typewriters.Let joy be unconfined.I still have my original typewriter from my days as a junior reporter on the Solihull News and it was a loyal servant that never crashed, froze or ran out of battery. I may even request for it to be buried with me.It seems that my love for these machines is rivalled only by Tom Hanks (yes, that one) who has written a book of short stories about them and created an app called the Hanx Writer, which emulates the glorious click-clack sound as you type.Go on, try it. There’s no greater pleasure.No? Just me then...Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Europe’s three biggest economies outside Britain are huge exporters to the UK — Germany, France, Italy.“They’d demand free trade from the EU.

Id like to fly in my boxers but I know its not allowed so going on GMB will not alter... Just making a name for himself.But more so why is religion always thrown in the pot.But others agreed with Sid when he argued that he should have been told about the dress code before being given the job.One wrote: To be fair BA should have addressed his hair/man bun before his first day of employment! Not 2 weeks in it just undermines their policy.Sid claimed it was only in his first week of work that a superior employee told him his hair needed to change, describing it as girls hair.When asked whether he had considered cutting his hair to keep his job, Sid argued: I dont feel like thats the point.The young man said he was now exploring other avenues for the future - saying he was going to look into a career with BA still.He said: Right now we live in multicultural Britain. We live in the age of equality and we should be open-minded.I have worked with lots of luxury retailers and never had an issue with my hair.A British Airways spokesman said: We dont comment in detail on individual employment matters."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000340450037.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=300\u0026amp;h=192\u0026amp;crop=1\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rail__item-content\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"rail__item-headline theme__copy-color\"\u003ePOO BUG HORROR\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cspan class=\"rail__item-sub\"\u003e Dozens of Brits struck down by FOURTH vomiting bug in Cancun, Mexico \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rail__item-cutoff\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca href=\"/news/6960","title":"customer gnomes swearing poundland flashing bums","story":"The item was on sale for £2 at the budget store in Bletchley, Milton Keynes, and was just yards from the “toys and games” section.One gnome had his middle finger up while the other was exposing its bottom and was positioned so it was “mooning” the other one.The naughty gnomes are situated in the garden section which is directly opposite shelves which contain children’s toys including bats and balls.The customer, who didn’t want to be named, told The Sun Online: “I was walking around my local Poundland today and I spotted a gnome on sale with its trousers down.“But I noticed that the one next to it was swearing and had its middle finger up.

Ministers were branded shameful as the shocking policy was disclosed in operational instructions sent to thousands of staff across the country. Critics say the data black hole lets top Tories conveniently avoid having to say how many people benefit cuts have pushed into poverty. The Trussell Trust charity handed out 1.3million food parcels last year - up from 61,000 in 2010/11 - with benefit delays the second-most common reason for turning to help. Yet just weeks ago, ministers said they\u0027d made no estimate of the use of foodbanks by people hit by a \u0026pound2billion child tax credits cut. And Theresa May has insisted there are many complex reasons for people begging for handouts. The guidance was released by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) under the Freedom of Information Act.  It deals with the policy for when staff hand out a signposting slip to benefit claimants, which effectively refers them to a food bank. There is a record sheet in which staff can write down the details of slips they have handed out. But guidance says the record sheet should only be completed if local foodbanks have specifically asked for it. Even then, the record should only be used to authenticate slips, staff are told - and it is not to be used for any other purpose, including to count/monitor the number of signposting slips issued.  Staff are not even allowed to call the slips vouchers, even though one foodbank manager told HuffPost UK - which first reported on the disclosure - that they are essentially the same thing.   Labour MP Frank Field, who leads the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, said: “Does the DWP not want to know how many times Jobcentre staff are having to refer people to foodbanks? “Any instruction that forbids staff from monitoring such trends should immediately be reversed.” Last month Labour peer Lord Bassam asked for an estimate of how many children had been pushed into poverty by the two-child limit on Child Tax Credits. The policy, which kicked in last year, is expected to cut almost \u0026pound2billion a year from the benefits bill by 2022.  But DWP minister Lord Bates told him: No estimate has been made of the use of food banks by families affected by the policy.   Lord Bassam told the Mirror: It is truly shameful that Ministers haven’t thought to assess this impact of their \u0026pound2bn cut. It begs the question: do they care?” "},{"url":null,"title":"just eat customer proposes girlfriend","story":"NewsJust Eat customer proposes to girlfriend with \"Will you marry me?\" written on hotdog boxThe Romeo behind the proposal and his bride-to-be had stopped at Chip Co in Belfast after meeting on a night outShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByRyan Smith08:29, 8 AUG 2018Updated10:21, 8 AUG 2018NewsThe question was written by a worker from a chippy (Image: Belfast Live)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man proposed to his girlfriend by asking a takeaway to write Will you marry me? on a hotdog box - and she said yes.

It was the first voyage across the Channel for Charles and Eliza-Jane Dowten of Port Talbot, South Wales, but for them and 11,000 other British travellers this was no joyful summer holiday. They were pilgrims travelling to the bombed-out city of Ypres in Belgium, where their son Percy – Ethel’s uncle – had been buried after his death on the front line a decade before. The journey was the first time many who lost loved ones in the First World War were able to visit their graves. As they paraded by the ruined Cloth Hall in Ypres’ main square, they were part of the most profound collective expression of grief since the Armistice. The Army called it the Great Pilgrimage. It was a truly momentous occasion, to which the Mirror devoted its whole front page the following day. “Many women, and even men, with poignant memories of the tragedies of the war, were in tears,” the article explained.  Ninety years later, Ethel, now 95 and still living in the terrace house in Port Talbot she went back to after that day – is again being represented at a commemoration in Ypres that echoes the original tribute to the fallen. Her son Gareth Scourfield, 71, is making the trip as part of a re-creation of the original march, with 2,200 members of the Royal British Legion. Only a handful of those going, however, have the same direct connection to the 1928 service which concluded at the Menin Gate. Percy died six weeks after he got to the Western Front, a month after his 18th birthday. He volunteered to join the Army in May 1918 and was assigned to the East Yorkshire Regiment. After basic training, he was shipped to France and from there to Ypres, where so many had died the previous year at the Battle of Passchendaele.  Percy was killed in action on September 29, 1918. Mother Eliza-Jane did not get the news until November, on the eve of the Armistice. “My grandmother never got over it,” Ethel tells me. “She was grieving for Uncle Percy for the rest of her life. Other members of the family told me she was never the same. She would often cry and I would ask what was the matter. She told me, ‘I’m thinking about my boy’. My mother, Jessie, missed him terribly too. She said he was kind and considerate.” Ethel remembers the day her grandparents set off. They had never left her before and she had to be reassured they would be back.  The trip was organised with military precision. All those taking part got a guidebook explaining every step of the route and what would happen once they got to Ypres. They were issued special tickets for use on chartered trains to take them to ports including Dover and Harwich, as well as one-off passports for what was a one-off foreign trip for nearly all the passengers. Each region was given its own train from London with a senior Army officer as train party leader. The Dowtens were on the Wales train and given accommodation in Tourcoing, on the French side of the Belgian border. They left on August 4 and then – having been billeted in guesthouses near the old battlefields, just like the soldiers they were remembering – were given escorted tours of the main sites.  In a photo at Percy’s grave, a simple wooden cross, Charles looks pained with grief. Ethel has kept this souvenir of the visit, as well as a brass sculpture given to all the pilgrims. Many of those in Ypres that day were widows of the war dead others were veterans who wanted to pay respects to fallen comrades. Novelist John Buchan, promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel during the war, penned a preface. “Some of the pilgrims have never been to the battlefield before,” he wrote. “But the place, unseen and unvisited, has played a great part in their lives. For four years it held all their thoughts, for their kin were fighting there.” He said the pilgrimage was for relatives to “see for themselves the spot where those dear to them underwent that fiery trial, perhaps to see their last resting place”. The commemoration service took place on August 8.  Our report from the time told how pilgrims stood in front of the Menin Gate to hear an address by the Archbishop of York. Buglers played Last Post to announce two minutes’ silence, then, pilgrims filed through the ravaged city in a quiet procession lasting an hour. The destruction in Ypres was a stark indication for all present of the carnage their loved ones had witnessed. Cloth Hall, previously the city’s focal point, had been razed by a German incendiary shell in 1914. As they marched past, they were saluted by the Prince of Wales – the future Edward VIII – and Prince Charles of Belgium. VIPs included Lady Spencer Churchill, Winston Churchill’s wife. The Menin Gate had been unveiled just a year before as a memorial to more than 54,000 missing Allied troops who died without a proper burial.

The group were convicted of organising a highly dangerous operation that attempted to ferry Albanian nationals into the UK using inflatable boats and a jet ski, Kent Live reports. On May 28, 2016, at least 18 migrants were taken from Calais to arrive in Dymchurch, Kent, where a white minibus was waiting for them. The migrants had been put into the inflatable boat - designed for just six people - but had to be rescued five miles off the coast after it got into difficulties. The plot involved Albanian organisers Artur Nutaj and Sabah Dulaj, who worked with a Kent-based group led by Leonard Powell, from Farningham, and his sons George and Alfie from Farningham and Swanley. Wayne Bath, from Sheerness, and Albert Letchford, from Gravesend, were also involved.  Migrants collected from hotels in Calais George Powell previously entered a guilty plea in May, though the remaining six denied the offence of conspiring to facilitate a breach of immigration law. The group of six went on trial at the Old Bailey, and were found guilty on Tuesday. They will all be sentenced on September 21.  Alan Viles from Folkestone and Francis Wade from Rochester were cleared. The National Crime Agency began their investigation after an inflatable boat equipped with life jackets was found dumped on Dymchurch beach in May 2016. Five days later the vessel was used to travel over to France and collect an unknown number of migrants. it was here that French police saw people being collected from hotels in Calais and taken to a beach at Escalles. The boat returned to Dymchurch in the early hours of May 11.  CCTV captured three vehicles, two of which were being driven by Nutaj and Dulaj, arriving at the slipway and then leaving shortly after. Later that month on the evening of May 26, the French National Police were again carrying out surveillance at Escalles beach when they witnessed a group of 17 people wading out into the water. At the same time, light signals were seen from a car park above the beach, causing a boat to leave the area.  Attempt to smuggle migrants on a jet-ski National Crime Agency investigations identified the boat to have been towed from Dymchurch earlier that day. This eventually led to the failed journey on May 28, where some 18 migrants had to be rescued off the Dymchurch coast. The two-man crew of the boat, Mark Stribling and Robert Stilwell, were later convicted and jailed. Later the the National Crime Agency discovered Leonard and George Powell buying a jet-ski in Sheerness, believed to be for the purpose of transporting migrants from France to the UK.  \u0027A staggeringly reckless plot\u0027 National Crime Agency regional head of investigations Brendan Foreman said: “These men were involved in a staggeringly reckless plot to bring migrants to the UK illegally and in a highly dangerous manner. “They were prepared to risk lives for the sake of profit, treating people as a commodity to ship across the world’s busiest shipping lane using small boats and even a jet ski.

Callie Rogers, 31, admitted she struggled with fame and fortune that the win brought her. She was just 16, the minimum age for the game, when she collected her cheque in 2003. She blew \u0026pound18,000 on boob jobs, \u0026pound250,000 on cocaine, another \u0026pound300,000 on clothes and gave away \u0026pound500,000 to friends and family. She told ITV\u0027s \u0027This Morning\u0027 that she battled depression and tried to take her own life. I wish I was a bit older at the time of winning it, she said.  At 16 you\u0027re just a child, then suddenly overnight you\u0027ve got to become an adult. You don\u0027t have any understanding of money and the concept of what it brings. There were people who came along who I did not know before and have not been in my life since. At the time, you just want everybody to like you. The money did bring problems with my family, and friends as well. It just became too much to cope with. She moved of her foster parents\u0027 home into a new \u0026pound180,000 house. Now a mum-of-three in a happy relationship, she said: Not knowing who liked me for me, and having all the stress of all the money, I just wanted to go back to having a normal life. I still struggle with trust issues.  Before hitting the jackpot she was earning \u0026pound3.60 an hour as a Co-op checkout girl in Cockermouth, Cumbria. Within weeks she met Nicky Lawson, father of her eldest two children, and had moved out to be with him. She quit work and splashed out on designer clothes, lavish presents for her biological parents and holidays, spending quarter of a million pounds on cocaine. So-called mates would come over until the early hours to party, she recalled in 2013. Suddenly, I was a local celeb and people would come up to me in pubs and I felt pressure to buy them all drinks. For so long, I drifted with no aims.  She moved to Workington, Cumbria with her fireman partner Paul Penny, and son Blake, who has cerebral palsy, settling down with a steady job. Camelot said they gave \u0027extensive advice and support\u0027 to Callie as they take their duty of care \u0027very seriously\u0027. She did not take up independent financial and legal advice offered, said a spokeswoman. However, our winners\u0027 team helped her to handle the media interest. Callie\u0027s case isn\u0027t the only Lotto winner whose life spiralled out of control following a big win. \u0027Lotto lout\u0027 Michael Carroll won \u0026pound9.7m in November 2002 aged just 19. He proclaimed himself \u0027King of the Chavs\u0027. In 2006, the BBC reported that he was almost broke, having spent his fortune on new homes, drugs, parties, jewellery and cars. I only started to think about three things - drugs, sex and gold, Carroll previously admitted.  The dealer who introduced me to crack has more of my lotto money than I do. In 2010 he applied for his old job as a binman but said he had no regrets how he splashed his winnings. Jane Park, Britain\u0027s youngest lottery winner at the time, threatened to sue EuroMillions claiming the win ruined her life. Jane was just 17 when she bagged \u0026pound1million in prize money after buying her first ever ticket.  Speaking to the Sunday People , she said: “I have material things but apart from that my life is empty.

Seth Welch and Tatiana Fusari, both Christians, have been charged with felony murder and first-degree child abuse. Their daughter, Mary, died on Thursday last week. Court documents revealed the couple had noticed Mary was looking thin a month before her death, but a distrust of doctors prevented them from seeking help.  In a Facebook post, Welch had written: The righteous shall live by faith. It\u0027s God who is sovereign over disease and those sorts of things and, of course, ultimately deaths.  In another rant he had branded doctors priesthoods of the medical cult.  A further post, voicing his opposition to vaccinations, said: Shouldn\u0027t we just let the weak die off and let the strong survive? The couple, both 27, appeared shocked as they appeared in a court in Kent County, Michigan, where charges were read out to them. They were told that they could face life in jail if convicted. Fusari burst into tears, while Welch glared at the judge with his mouth wide open.  An affidavit signed ahead of their court appearance said: During interviews with both parents, admissions were made that they were aware of Mary Welch\u0027s skinny appearance and low weight for at least one month prior to this date. Tatiana Fusari admitted during the interview that they failed to reach out for medical help with their daughter for fear of having her children removed by Child Protective Services, lack of faith and trust in the medical services and religious reasons.

Zac Edwards, 37, was posing for pictures with bride Cindy Edwards, 32, on Friday when panicked guests spotted the teenager struggling in the water. The marine science technician immediately plunged into the water and swam 150 feet to help the boy. He had got into difficulty in strong currents while playing on a boogie board at Shell Beach in Gulf State Park in Alabama.  Zac propped the youngster on the boogie board and arrived at his own wedding reception soaked and covered in sand.   You could just tell by the look on his face he was in difficulty. When we first saw him he was about 50 yards out. I took off my shirt, but my wife said I didn\u0027t have time to take off my pants. I ran into the water. I told some kids to go back to the beach and I took a boogie board. I’m so glad I did that, Zac said. The newly wed, of Spanish Fort, Alabama, added: I eventually reached him but we were about half a football field away from the shore. He just kept saying \u0027I can’t breathe\u0027. I tried to keep his head above water and I propped him up onto the boogie board.  The current was really strong and it was stopping us coming in any further. I was starting to panic slightly. The pants were making it hard to kick too. But when I saw the first responders I knew it was going to be okay. A jet ski came out to us and I managed to wedge him up onto it. I didn’t really take in the gravity of the situation until I laid down that night. Afterwards my hands were shaking but the adrenaline was just pumping. Orange Beach Fire Department and Orange Beach Surf Rescue, who had been attending to another emergency on the beach, assisted the marine expert and wedged the teenager onto a jetski. Zac jumped on himself and returned the lad to shore. Cindy, who had been with Zac for one year before tying the knot, admitted she panicked her husband was tiring during the dramatic rescue.  She said: I could tell Zac was tiring and they couldn’t get over the current. They had stopped and I was worried. Thank God the first responders arrived. The lifeguards dived into the water and there were helicopters were patrolling the waters. Our emergency services in Orange Beach can’t be commended enough. Luckily, the teenager has since recovered. Now Cindy and Zac, who each have three children, have warned of the importance of water safety.

The unknown man plunged from a Magaluf sixth-floor balcony last Friday while reportedly defecating.  He checked himself out of the Son Espases Hospital in the island capital Palma without waiting for doctors to give him the all-clear. He faced a €600 (\u0026pound537) fine from police for \u0027balconing\u0027 - the term the Spanish use for people jumping between balconies or leaping from their hotel terraces into the pool below.  Hospital sources confirmed he left on Sunday - just two days after he cheated death and was rushed away from the HRH Magaluf Hotel on a stretcher and admitted “seriously injured” to intensive care.  Do you know the man? Email webnews@mirror  It was not immediately clear today what sort of state he was in when he abandoned his hospital bed. A source at Calvia Town Hall, which covers the Magaluf area as well as Santa Ponsa which is popular with Irish holidaymakers, said: He is the only one of the six people the police have decided to fine so far this year in the municipality who hasn’t been given his penalty charge notice. “He checked himself out of hospital before police could present him with his demand to pay and we think he’s left the island after leaving his hotel. “We are now making attempts to find an address for him in the UK and inform him that way.” Meanwhile an Irish holidaymaker has become the sixth person to be punished for balcony-jumping in the area. Local police visited the tourist in hospital as he was recovering and told him he must pay a €600 fine before he flew back home for balconing.  The council confirmed in a statement: “The last case of balconing was on Monday at 5.30am when an Irish 21-year-old fell from a height of four metres (13 feet). “He appears to have broken his kneecap and was transferred to Son Espases Hospital. “The cases that ended up with fines last month included one in Santa Ponsa, thanks to hotel CCTV footage, and another in Magaluf last Friday. “In total the number of sanctions this year for balconing in the municipality of Calvia now total six, one in June, three in July and two in August.” The figures released by the council show the number of balconing incidents that have ended in fines this year in Calvia have doubled, from three last year to six this year. While the number of balconing incidents ending in fines are up on last year, the number of fines for nudity and semi-nudity have plummeted. Calvia Council figures show 24 people were fined last year, mostly in Magaluf, compared with just 12 so far this year in the area which is now calmer than June and July with more families and less of the sort of badly-behaved drunken tourism council chiefs are fighting back against.

It may also cause burns due to coldness if inhaled directly from a canister.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/SNS-15266981-Ayr-United-v-Partick.jpg-794x564.jpg ","title":"ayr united receive 150k bid for dundee target lawrence shankland","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAyr United have revealed a £150k bid for Lawrence Shankland has been turned down.Dundee have been widely linked with the Championship hotshot who has already netted nine times this campaign.The club who made the six-figure bid is from England but has not been identified.It was previously reported any side who would want to acquire the 22-year-old\u0026#8217s services would have to stump up at least £250k, with add-ons.A statement from the Honest Men today read: \u0026#8220To pre-empt any speculation in the media we can confirm that we have today received a bid of £150k from a club south of the border.

It can be summed up with the following words – tough luck, because both are going to be in short supply.When it comes to the first, the fact is the time to be ready for any league season is on day one.At the weekend, United were not and that’s why, despite losing out to the odd goal in five, they were comprehensively beaten by a Pars outfit that was ready for action while they were found lacking.In pointing that out, it’s worth remembering that, although Dunfermline’s wasn’t quite to the same extent, over the summer circumstances meant they were forced to undertake a major overhaul of their squad that saw players leave and 10 new faces brought in.That was not least because they lost two of their key performers, Nicky Clark and Fraser Aird, to the Tangerines. Despite that, particularly during the second half of the weekend game, the visitors looked a strong and cohesive unit that was sound at the back and dangerous going forward.By way of contrast, the longer the game went on the more disjointed United became.However valid the reasons for that may be, the rest of the Championship is not going to sit back and give them time to get their act together.In Dumfries this weekend it’s more than reasonable to expect Queen of the South to do all they can to come out of the blocks quickly, hit United hard and early and try to stay on top of them.That’s just common sense and an approach that’s to be expected from the opposition for weeks to come, if not longer.Put simply, when a team looks as vulnerable as Csaba Laszlo’s do, they are going to be tested early in games and it’s only by winning matches they can expect opponents to start cautiously.As for patience, something being sought from fans, there has to be a realisation that among Arabs it’s not so much worn thin as disintegrated.A support that’s been used to top-six finishes in the Premiership and cup final appearances, has been put through hell and are now facing a third season out of the top flight.So much so that when new chairman Mike Martin addresses them, he often starts off with an apology, and wisely so.Through no fault of their own, supporters have been stuck in a long dark tunnel and, if they cannot see any light at the end of it, they cannot be asked to show understanding.Make no mistake about it, their team is where it is because results dictate that’s their true position in Scottish football.But when they look at where Dundee United have been and the lingering perception of it as a size of club, the very least Arabs have a right to expect is a side that’s challenging to get back up.Some 5,000 of them turned up for the league opener and gave yet another indication of where United could be.No other clubs outside of the Old Firm, Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs can rely on that kind of turn-out on a Saturday.If this team don’t start producing, they’ll not be able to either.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

I don’t think there is anything about the Brexit planning of the UK government that I would describe as satisfactory.”Mr Gove said the UK Government “wanted to ensure that European nations have access to our markets and products in an uninterrupted way and at the same time that we can take back control of our agricultural policy, farming policy and our borders”.HE added: “We want a deal but we are ready for every eventuality and we’re making appropriate provisions for whatever eventuality arises.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b63f4096fedf-846x564.jpg ","title":"students are driving force at legendary silverstone","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen university motorsport team has raced its way to take 9th place in a prestigious competition.TAU Racing, run by Aberdeen University students, took home the accolade at an international competition held at the historic Silverstone race track in Towcester, home of the Formula One British Grand Prix.TAU, along with other teams from across the world including America and Europe, took to the track at Silverstone for the Formula Student UK event, celebrating the weekend’s 20th anniversary.Arran Strutt, the 21-year-old project manager, said: “We’re absolutely ecstatic to have placed where we did, especially given the obstacles put in front of us.“We worked out that it took our 60 members a total of 11,000 hours to put this car together from the ground up.”The cars themselves, which cost TAU between £20,000 and £30,000, are built and rebuilt from scratch every year, using the knowledge of the students.Arran admits that some of the pricier parts may be kept, but the majority is all brand new.He said: “Each car is built from scratch. We manufacture the chassis ourself, and fully design the car from the ground up.“Sometimes we might even use systems that we’ve designed as part of our course.“Things are held over, in terms of expensive components, but the whole design is fresh.”The team overcame a setback on its Aberdeenshire test track to take part in the competition, which took place between July 13 and 15. The day before the competition, during test laps, a wheel assembly collapsed, prompting the skeleton crew to replace it with one used on a previous car.Arran said: “It was a very tense atmosphere, we had a skeleton crew of about five or six there, and it took a really big push to get everything sorted.“It’s fair to say that they all did a great job.”Far from being an engineering-only event, Arran also spoke of how multi-faceted the competition is, with each team having to submit a business case, including costings to judges, as well as securing sponsors to cover the costs of the car.The mechanical engineering student said: “We have business students as part of the team, who are tasked with putting together a business case, as if we were going to mass produce the car.”Arran also mentioned the positive impact the team has on students.He said: “There’s a huge student development side.“Engineering students can apply theoretical knowledge that you learn in class on to the car, and you can learn other skills that you might not, like the manufacturing side.”Professor Igor Guz, head of the university’s school of engineering, said: “I am delighted that TAU Racing has achieved another great result in this year’s Formula Student competition. The result is a testament to the hard work and commitment of the team, and demonstrates the opportunities open to students when they come to study at one of the UK’s top universities for engineering.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen lynx and express partner up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Evening Express will be the official media partner of the Aberdeen Lynx for the coming season.The Linx Ice Arena-based side, who play in the Scottish National League (SNL), are gearing up for the start of the 2018/19 campaign.Fixtures are expected to be announced this week, with matches beginning in September.For the whole campaign, the Evening Express, in print and online, will be the no.1 place for Lynx news across the age groups, match reports and reaction.The Evening Express logo will also feature on the club’s jerseys for the forthcoming term.Lynx chairman Martin Hill said: “I am delighted to enter into partnership with the Evening Express.“Their coverage of the club over the last few years has been a big help, I am sure, into making the Lynx one of the best-supported ice hockey clubs in Scotland and this new deal will help take that to the next level, featuring not just reports and stories about our SNL side, but also on our junior development programmes as well.“As a club that is fiercely proud of it’s local roots and location, it makes absolute sense that we partner with a newspaper that shares such an ethos, and I’m sure our fans will look forward to the increased coverage we will receive with excitement.”Evening Express editor Craig Walker said: “In our newspaper and online, the Evening Express strives to support and promote local sport.“The Aberdeen Lynx are a real success story, attracting close to 1,000 people to their home games at the Linx Ice Arena and continuing to grow year on year.“The ice hockey club’s senior side are second only to Aberdeen FC in terms of attendance in the north-east, and they also provide opportunities across the youth age groups.“This partnership will see continued, unrivalled coverage of the Lynx’s matches and other news and we look forward to working with them throughout the campaign.”The Lynx have announced their main sponsor for the 2018/19 campaign will be LeMack Oilfield Rentals.The Portlethen-based company’s logo will appear on all of the club’s kits and they will also sponsor the team’s tracksuits until the end of the 2019/20 season.Lynx chairman Martin Hill said: “We are immensely grateful to Kenny Mack and Davie Hale of LeMack for this extremely generous sponsorship deal, which is a massive boost to the club.“While we have a fan base that is the envy of some Elite League Ice Hockey Clubs, the club still have to balance the books.“Last season the club was running teams at Under-12, U14, U16, U20 and SNL, and with costs to the club in terms of coach hire for away games, ice hire for matches and training, purchasing new kit and so on always increasing, sponsorship from local business is a key income stream for the Lynx.“Sponsoring the Lynx also provides great exposure for local business, with crowds averaging almost 900 people, and over 300 replica shirts featuring our sponsor logos sold last season.“We are very proud to be associated with LeMack, a company, which, like ourselves, is a local success story – and look forward to this season bringing more success to the Linx Ice Arena”LeMack take over from two-year main sponsors Petrolink.LeMack’s Davie Hale said: “We at LeMack Oilfield Rentals Ltd are proud and honoured to be associated with and are the main sponsor for Aberdeen Lynx.”\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains.

A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jenny celebrates 90 years","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 7:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowJenny Speirs of Inveraray recently celebrated her 90th birthday.She celebrated the milestone in style with a lunch party for family, friends and neighbours including cousins from Australia.Jenny thanks everyone for the lovely cards, flowers and gifts given to her during the celebrations.Donations in lieu of presents, at Jenny\u0026#8217s request, raised £300 for Cancer Research.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sheep and showers in high quality blackface show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 04/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA high quality show of sheep was held at Cairndow amid heavy showers interrupted by fiery sunshine.The annual Cowal Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association show at Clachan \u0026#8211 right beside the Loch Fyne Oysters complex \u0026#8211 drew curious (if slightly bemused) tourists and seasoned hill shepherds in almost equal measure.The sheep show has, in recent years, been supported by a display of vintage tractors and other machinery, and this year Cowal Vintage Transport Club and Bute Vintage Club provided the gleaming hardware for visitors to enjoy.You can find pictures of the vintage machinery show on page 34.In the show ring, the overall champion came from Dyke Farm, Milton of Campsie, with a young ewe by £24,000 Elmscleugh out of a ewe by a son of Travis.The reserve overall was a ewe by Buffalo out of a dam by a £4,000 Midlock from Messrs MacPherson, Balliemeanoch, Loch Awe.In the section confined to the district of Cowal, the champion was from Pole Farm, Lochgoilhead, with a gimmer by Spectre out of a ewe by a £5,200 Allanfauld sire.The confined reserve champion \u0026#8211 and best sheep of the opposite sex to the overall champion \u0026#8211 was from Messrs Campbell, Drimsynie, Lochgoilhead, with a shearling tup by Allanfauld Pogba out of ewe by a 40k Nunnerie sire.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

We are confident our proposals have reached an optimum balance between these aspects.\u0026#8216As a responsible developer, we believe it is important to seek public opinion on our proposals and take that feedback into consideration when developing our projects. The consultation events last September marked the third round of public engagement events held for this project since October 2014 and I thank everyone who has taken the time to comment so far.\u0026#8217Further information regarding the Inveraray – Crossaig project can be obtained from ssen-transmission\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sea unites the story of inverarays ferry","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/08/18, 8:55 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Colin CameronMuch of the detail in this feature comes from two booklets written by the late Donald MacKechnie, the well-known Inveraray schoolmaster and local historian.The booklets, \u0026#8216Inveraray Notes\u0026#8217 and \u0026#8216Inveraray Tales and Traditions\u0026#8217, were published in the 1980s.Look out for tales from these fascinating booklets in coming editions of the Argyllshire Advertiser.As a starter, we turn to links across Loch Fyne, and the Inveraray-St Catherines ferry.Based on information by Donald MacKechnieFrom the Middle Ages until 1963 a ferry sailed between Inveraray and St Catherines \u0026#8211 one of seven similar services up and down Loch Fyne linking Cowal and Mid Argyll. Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crunch meeting on ardrishaig club future","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/08/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA meeting is to be held next month to gauge interest in reviving a Mid Argyll sailing club.Disquiet has been growing in Ardrishaig while weeds grow up around sailing boats and canoes belonging to Mid Argyll Water Sports Club.The boats, bought with the help of grant funding from Ardrishaig Community Trust, are lying on the Ardrishaig waterfront, unused in 2018.The Argyllshire Advertiser spoke to Peter Hogbin, who was involved in the club for many years.

The marquees provided shelter from the showers and a chance to browse the stalls.As well as classics like the bottle stall and guess the weight of the cake, there were representations from local businesses, voluntary groups and organisations, including the RNLI, Friends of the Sound of Jura, Heart of Argyll Wildlife and the 19th Argyll Scouts.After a break for lunch of paella, barbecue, sandwiches and home baking, the sun came out in time for the fabulous dog show, which featured novelty classes such as best six legs, fancy dress and the dog and handler race.Events moved into the hall on Saturday evening for the family ceilidh, where the fantastic Argyll Ceilidh Trail band kept the dancers on their feet into Sunday morning.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

Yes dear readers, if all of the above was improbable – it might even have been amusing. But the demise and ultimate destruction of South Ayrshire’s busiest transport hub isn’t improbable – it’s inevitable. Last weekend, most of the United Kingdom was looking skywards for a glimpse of a “blood moon”. But on Saturday, I looked skywards as I walked across the Station Bridge . ... and all I saw was a bloody disgrace. Belts and straps have now been attached to Ayr Station Hotel’s chimney stacks in a bid to safely secure them. New areas at the Smith Street end of the station have been declared unsafe. The “no-go area” fencing that once cordoned a section of the front car park has been extended to barricade the entire building. If this was 1945, we could probably keep Rudolph Hess banged up in there! The harsh fact is that Ayr Station and its hotel have moved on from being a giant embarrassment to becoming the biggest threat to public safety, the local economy and the environment in South Ayrshire’s living memory. And what are South Ayrshire’s elected members doing about it? Er .... they’re all on their summer recess! On safety – is the Station Bridge REALLY safe for cars and pedestrians? A single lane was closed for “scaffolding work” – but it’s been scaffold-free for five weeks. If the gable-end chimneys need belts and buckles, is it prudent to allow the public to pass barely fifty yards below them? On the economy – I know my own business has been affected by the railway chaos. Many of my Ayr racecourse regulars by-passed the town centre and headed straight to the track from the station’s east side. And if I’m feeling it – God help the shops, bars, eateries and taxi drivers based around Smith Street and Burns Statue Square. On the environment – has anyone contemplated the dust, fumes and noise pollution that will surely come with demolishing a giant sandstone structure that’s visible from the Kilmarnock by-pass? MP Bill Grant was in my boozer last weekend – but on the first week of his hols, I extended the courtesy of letting him socialise with his friends. But I know he reads this page – and I hope he and MSP John Scott will be in agreement that two things must happen soon: 1) An Ayr Station Emergency Committee be set up involving all stakeholders – including structural and civil engineers, Scot Rail, South Ayrshire Council, road traffic management and local businesses. Its remit would be look at the entire station issue – and how best to fit all future works into the community. And if they can get Ayr Station Hotel’s owner to show up – a bit of public flogging wouldn’t go amiss either. 2) An independent investigation be set up to demand the facts from South Ayrshire Council on what they did – and didn’t do – as they watched an iconic town centre building fall into ruin right in front of them.

But what about looking back on memories from centuries ago? That is what interests many people. There’s nothing better to some folk than looking at a newspaper from over 100 years ago, or digging out old currency. And that’s where time capsules come in. Last week we featured a time capsule that was set to be buried at Burns Monument in Alloway. So that got us wondering, what would the good people of Ayr put in a time capsule for future generations to look back on? Myra McCrindle, of Ayr, said: “I’d put in an encyclopedia to keep people informed.  “But I would also put in a bottle of my favourite red wine! Then I would look after their well-being by throwing in some moisturiser and a hair dryer. It’s important to look good.” Katie Drennan, 18, of Ayr, said: “I’d put a mobile phone in. “In 100 years’ time the technology will be different, so I think people in the future should see what kind of tech we had. “Although I doubt the battery would last that long!” Ayr United daft Gordon Kidd said: “I’d put in a black and white scarf along with a picture of Lawrence Shankland. “I’d also put in stuff from the Ally MacLeod era.” Mary Dibden, 66, of Ayr said: “A tennis racket as my grandpa took me to play at Lendalfoot.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13045140.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS158470242.jpg","title":"new arrivals bring light parents","story":"NewsNew arrivals bring a light to parents\u0027 livesWe wish all the best to the new happy families, and any other recent newborns.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet15:45, 7 AUG 2018Updated15:49, 7 AUG 2018NewsNew arrivalsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA number of new arrivals have been welcomed to Ayrshire.

And John Scott MSP believes the 22 homes will breathe new life into an area, off McCall’s Avenue. Mr Scott visited the Britannia Place site, being developed by Hanover Scotland Housing Association, with funding from South Ayrshire Council and the Scottish Government. Builders are CCG (Scotland) Ltd, and the new development, once completed, will be known as Cuthbert Gardens. The name reflects the history of the site, which used to contain the Newton Shoe Factory owned by the Cuthbert family. People are expected to move into the general needs social housing, ranging from two to four bedrooms, early in 2019. Mr Scott met with senior managers from both Hanover Scotland and CCG and was given a tour of the site. He heard about valuable engagement with local residents during construction and how the design had come about, as well as health and safety precautions.  Janice McDonald is the Enhanced Housing Manger for Hanover Scotland. She said: “We already have nine developments in South Ayrshire, and Cuthbert Gardens is our tenth.” She added: “This area is important to future plans and we look forward to delivering more high quality social housing.” John Scott MSP added: “I am delighted to have been able to visit, and look forward to returning to Cuthbert Gardens when it is completed in the New Year. “My office receives regular calls from constituents looking for, in particular, ground level accommodation which is affordable. “So it is hugely welcome that Hanover Scotland and CCG are able to deliver this kind of new supply to the area.” Calum Murray, Director of CCG, said: “This now takes our overall number of homes presently under construction to 61 units. “By utilising ‘offsite’ methods of construction, these new homes will be constructed to the highest quality standard and thanks to a bespoke manufacturing process, their environmental performance will ensure long-term energy savings for the future residents. “CCG can also confirm that as a direct result of this project, we have been able to engage with local colleges to provide training and employment opportunities for the South Ayrshire community.” "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic ban town square cumnock","story":"NewsTraffic ban in Town Square in CumnockFears over congestion in nearby roadsShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning10:05, 5 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailConcerns have been raised about traffic chaos when cars are banned from the Town Square in Cumnock. But vehicles needing access to Old Cumnock Old Church for weddings or funerals will continue to have access. These vehicles will have to show a permit to access The Square. Any other vehicles will be hit by a fixed-penalty notice if they flout the new traffic regulations. The move is designed to improve safety to pedestrians and cyclists in the Square. One community councillor said it would stop parking outside the hairdressers and takeaways at the Square: “Traffic in the Square will be limited,” he added. “From the beginning of August anyone driving a car would need to have a permit. “It will be limited to funeral cars, wedding cars for church services “The main thing is they are going to block off pedestrian crossing outside the Royal Hotel. “So the cars are going to have to come in and go back out into Lugar Street. “It is going to be mayhem in Lugar Street. “I suggested reversing the one way system at Hamilton Place and make it street pedestrian only.” Another community councillor asked how it would be implemented. He added: “Who is going to patrol it? “Will it be police or traffic wardens. “I haven’t seen police in the square.” Stewart Turner, head of road at Ayrshire Roads Alliance, said: “Access to The Square will be limited to vehicles directly associated with wedding and funeral operations at Old Cumnock Old Church. “These vehicles will be required to display a permit to access The Square. Permits are available free of charge from the Ayrshire Roads Alliance. “We have contacted several wedding and funeral operators in the immediate area and advised of this requirement. “Exemptions to the access restriction include vehicles engaged in building work, road repairs, utility repairs, postal delivery, cash collection, furniture removal operations and the emergency services. “The Square will also have waiting and loading restrictions in force at all times. This will enable a Parking Attendant employed by the Council to issue a Penalty Charge Notice to any vehicle within The Square contravening the restrictions.  “Exemptions to the waiting  and loading restrictions are exactly the same as the access restriction.  “I do not anticipate traffic congestion on Lugar Street as a result of this Order. “The Order was promoted to prevent danger to pedestrians and cyclists in The Square. “The Order was advertised on Wednesday March 28 and received no objections. “The Order is fully supported by Police Scotland and they will be responsible for enforcing the restrictions.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPolice ScotlandCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"borderers-have-a-chance-to-saddle-up-and-own-a-pony-for-a-day","story":"HORSE-LOVERS in the Borders are being given the chance to own a pony for the day.\nHarestanes Countryside Visitors Centre, near Jedburgh, is hosting an event to give youngsters over the age of eight the opportunity to learn more about equestrian.\nThe event will be run by Eat Sleep Ride CIC, a registered community interest company, licensed riding school and trekking centre.\nAnd after the previous success of Pony Ride Days, leisure trust Live Borders, which runs the venue, has decided to bring the programme back this year.\nHarestanes manager, Michael Scott said: \u0026ldquoOver the last couple of months we have had some fantastic numbers and feedback from our pony riding days so we decided during the holidays to provide a different programme for people looking to gain some experience in care and preparation of horses and ponies.\n\u0026ldquoWith the Own a Pony Days, participants will spend the whole day with the pony.\n\u0026ldquoWe have had plenty of interest in these two days so we are urging people to book their spots before they are all gone.\nParticipants will take their pony through grooming, plaiting, tacking up, leading, riding, games, obstacle course, lesson and a mini show.\nThere are 12 places available each day (two people per pony) and the minimum age is eight so that a child does not have to be accompanied by an adult.\nAdults are also welcome to participate.\nParticipants are asked to bring appropriate clothing for all weather and a change of clothes.

haunt of many writers down the centuries, including Rabbie Burns and Sir Walter Scott.\nAfter its closure in 2006, a community group was formed to fight plans to demolish sections and convert parts into housing.\nFollowing years of legal wrangles and funding applications the community purchased the historic building in 2013.\nIt was hoped that the Tweedsmuir Community Company would raise the required \u0026pound2 million to turn the Crook into a major tourist destination and hub for Tweedsmuir.\nBut the group has now changed course with a phased plan of development - starting with the conversion of the former steading building into a cafe.\nThe group also wants to create a bunkhouse in the former staff quarters during phase one.\nDuncan Davidson, chairman of Tweedsmuir Community Company, told us: \"Developments are afoot for the Crook Inn.\n\"Although we now have great designs, with planning permission, for complete renovation to create a Crook Inn Community Hub, the funding for the complete renovation has not been obtained.\n\"So we are developing a phased plan of redevelopment to convert the previous steading building into a caf\u0026eacute to serve the local community and tourism and for a new-build bunkhouse in the previous staff accommodation.\"\nFunding from the Scottish Government\u0027s Strengthening Communities Programme has enabled the Tweedsmuir Community Company to appoint the highly-regarded heritage and business company, Jura Consultants, to assist with business planning and obtaining further funding.\nThe community group is also looking to appoint a part-time Community Development Officer for an initial six months to help with community support and development.\nFurther information on the post can be obtained from Mr Davidson on 07783342302 or

daughter, they played at cultural centres, pubs, and popular concert series.\nAnd the trip acted as a reconnaissance for the duo as they discovered their family history in Ireland and Scotland and began to collect the traditional songs of the people.\nThis spark of song collecting re-inspired their love of storytelling and performing intimate, acoustic concerts and infiltrated their repertoire of original songs with a smattering of uniquely interpreted traditional songs.\nFellow Pynins\u0026rsquo music employs the sounds of the mandolin, banjo, guitar, bouzouki and their voices in harmony

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp.

\u0026pound44 to \u0026pound1,205.\nThe increase is the second for British Gas customers this year, after the company announced in April that it\u0026nbspwas increasing its prices by an average 5.5% from May 29 for both its SVT and its new Temporary Tariff fixed-rate deal, which replaced the standard tariff at the end of March.\nBritish Gas said it was increasing its prices again following a 20% rise in the costs of buying wholesale energy since April.\nThe company said 3.5 million customers were affected by the latest increase, but added it would be contacting them to consider alternatives to the SVT and expected that figure to drop to three million by the end of the year.\nMark Hodges, chief executive of Centrica Consumer, said: \u0026ldquoWe have today reluctantly announced plans for an increase in our standard variable tariff (SVT).\n\u0026ldquoWe understand that any price increase adds extra pressure on customers\u0026rsquo household bills.\n\u0026ldquoHowever, this reflects the

have also announced a second increase to the prepayment meter cap.\n\u0026ldquoWith more than 70 energy supply businesses now operating in the UK, the energy market is increasingly competitive and we are focused on offering all our customers attractive fixed and bundled deals.\nThe increase comes a day after the energy regulator increased its price cap on variable tariffs due to rising wholesale prices.\nOfgem said its safeguard tariff, which protects five million households from overcharging, will rise by \u0026pound47 per year in October to \u0026pound1,136.\nThe watchdog said it was increasing the cap due to rising oil prices, which have fed through to wholesale gas prices.\nIt follows a series of price hikes from the energy companies over the summer, affecting millions of households.\nE.ON, SSE, Npower, EDF, ScottishPower and Bulb have all hiked energy prices, blaming wholesale energy costs for the increases.\nConsumer groups have warned energy customers about the rising tariffs, saying they should switch to a better deal.\nConsumer watchdog Which? has estimated that customers who do not seek out the best deals could end up overpaying by as much as

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

This year it was reprinted by Comely Bank Publishing as Russain Doll.In a strange synchronicity, at virtually the same time as last week’s talk, former SNP leader and MP Alex Salmond, who now broadcasts for Russian television, was dumped as a potential chairman by the investor trying to takeover Johnston Press.Drawing on her own seven years BBC radio experience, Ms Lloyd’s heroine, Anna, is a radio producer at the Scottish Broadcasting Corporation as it has been renamed after independence.The book’s blurb states: ‘In an independent Scotland, Russia attempts a soft occupation under the noses of the novice government.‘Against her best intentions, she finds herself falling for a Russian diplomat tasked with delivering Scotland into Moscow’s hands.‘As war looms, will this relationship save, or destroy, Anna?’Ms Lloyd, a scientist, runner and skier says she was on the river or pitch more than in a lab.This description fits Anna who is often described as ‘out for a run’ and Ms Lloyd says is: ‘Feisty, smart, sporty and spouting opinions.’‘When I wrote the book, the Brexit vote had not happened and Donald Trump was a bad television games show host,’ said Ms Lloyd. ‘It was written before the concept of fake news.‘It is more of a love story than a political novel. I remembered looking at photos from when Paris was liberated in 1945 after the German occupation and wondering what happened to the collaborators.‘It is written in a post-independence parallel world, so much has happened since 2014.‘Russia presents an amazing enigma of tremendous wealth but is their relationship with the West more about posturing?’One member of the dozen who attended the talk asked: ‘Do you think Scots would prefer Euros to Roubles?’Ms Lloyd said she glossed over the question of Europe but did imagine that Scotland would have to renegotiate its seat at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Ms Lloyd is working on a second book and said: ‘I have young children so I can indulge myself.’Russian Doll is available for £9.99 from Amazon and booksellers or direct from the author, who also sells a natty line in sports socks.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter sea photos wanted","story":"Photographers across the UK have just two weeks to enter their best images of the sea in an annual photography competition run by national maritime charity, the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society.The competition, which closes on Monday, August 13, encourages amateur and professional photographers to submit pictures that best encapsulate Britain’s enduring connection with the sea.It celebrates the nation’s proud maritime heritage and our reliance on seafarers.The competition’s prestigious judging panel includes experts from the Sunday Times, the I, and Amateur Photographer Magazine, alongside the charity’s chief executive, Captain Justin Osmond.The overall winner of the competition will be presented with a voucher for photographic equipment.The Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society provides financial assistance to fishermen, mariners and their dependants who are suffering hardship, whether due to accident, ill health, unemployment or in retirement after a life spent working at sea.In the last year the charity received 560 new applications for assistance and distributed £1.4 million in more than 2,000 cases of need.To enter the competition go to: www.shipwreckedmariners.org.uk or  www.facebook/shipwreckedmariners and @ShipwreckedSoc.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lotto draws 4","story":"The draw for Dunaverty\u0026#8217s three number lotto was made on July 19.The winning numbers were five, seven and 17.There were no winners and the next draw for a jackpot of £200 will be held on August 12.Tickets are available from committee members, the club steward, Muneroy tearooms and the Burnside bar.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"caledonia way cycling companion guidebook","story":"A comprehensive pedaling plan to the cycle route from Campbeltown to Inverness was published last week.The 118 page handlebar bag sized spiral bound book, to guide cyclists on National Cycle Route 78, is so far available at Machrihanish Holiday Park, Patersons Bakery Carradale, Skipness Smokehouse and Argyll Backpackers at Inverneil.Independent publishers, The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Janet Moss and Pete Martin, visited Campbeltown last Thursday, from their Cumbria base, to launch the book\u0026#8217s first edition.It was the pair\u0026#8217s second visit since May when they put finishing touches to the production which started about 18 months ago.Mr Martin said: \u0026#8216The Caledonia Way covers some of Scotland\u0026#8217s best scenery with plenty of emptiness.\u0026#8216The guide has full listing sections including complete Ordnance Survey maps of each section, a comprehensive accommodation guide and locations where cycle spares might be found.\u0026#8216We have cycled the route at least once in both directions although much of the research has been during the winter months.\u0026#8216Some of the toughest bits of the route are between Campbeltown and Oban.\u0026#8217The route is split into six sections and includes fully Ordnance Survey maps detailing each day\u0026#8217s ride.Travel to Campbeltown is more complicated than to Inverness, for the bike borne tourist, but the Offcomers suggest the ferry as a good option particularly as the fare is £7.90 and the bike goes free.Apart from some slight niggles, such as the second line, describing Campbeltown as being at the southern end of the Kintyre Peninsular (sic), it is a fine guide to the route.There are ominous omissions in the accommodation listing and places to eat. For instance in Campbeltown Amelias, Food for Thought and Ceann Loch Diner are excluded.Neither of Campbeltown\u0026#8217s fish and chip shops are included, either in the listings or on the map, despite there being a map symbol for those takeaways.Many cyclists are inquisitive and will no doubt discover other options as the guide is just a starting point.The Caledonia Way may also appeal to motorised travellers as well as the self propelled.A separate concertina trip planner leaflet, inserted at the back of the book, shows a height cross section of the full route and is cross referenced to the accommodation providers.On the reverse of this route planner is a diagrammatic map, trip planning tool and mileage chart including a speech bubble stating: \u0026#8216Are there any more hills today.\u0026#8217The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Pete Martin and Janet Moss with their guidebook at the Campbeltown launch. 25_c31caledonia01_PeteMartin_Janet_Moss\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane august 3 2018","story":"In the days before rapid transatlantic flights, The Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Queen Elizabeth operated a weekly luxury liner service between Southampton and New York.A phone call, to the Southampton ferry and tug company Red Funnel, started a huge and challenging recovery exercise to refloat the 83,000 ton liner from the Bramble Bank.Tugs Canute, Clausentum, Neptune and Vulcan and Alexandra Towing Company\u0026#8217s Romey, Hornby and Poulsom were sent but soon it was realised more would be needed.Last week down memory lane featured the Royal Navy tug HMRT Bustler, a model of which is in Campbeltown museum.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training. If this is the case it would obviously be of concern so we will look into this as a matter of urgency.  Police Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been made aware of a number of incidents which have taken place in the Foresters Park area of Tranent recently, including vandalisms to the football pitch and break-ins to a catering facility.  \u0026ldquoThis behaviour is completely unacceptable and local officers are committed to working with East Lothian Council and enjoyleisure to prevent further incidents and deter anti-social behaviour.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

British Gas said it was increasing its prices again following a 20% rise in the costs of buying wholesale energy since April.  The company said 3.5 million customers were affected by the latest increase, but added it would be contacting them to consider alternatives to the SVT and expected that figure to drop to three million by the end of the year.  Mark Hodges, chief executive of Centrica Consumer, said: \u0026ldquoWe have today reluctantly announced plans for an increase in our standard variable tariff (SVT).  \u0026ldquoWe understand that any price increase adds extra pressure on customers\u0026rsquo household bills.  \u0026ldquoHowever, this reflects the sharp rise in wholesale energy costs.  \u0026ldquoIn response to rapidly rising wholesale market costs, since April a number of other energy supply companies have increased their SVT prices and Ofgem have also announced a second increase to the prepayment meter cap.  \u0026ldquoWith more than 70 energy supply businesses now operating in the UK, the energy market is increasingly competitive and we are focused on offering all our customers attractive fixed and bundled deals.

Serco, who agreed to suspend any action for 21 days, now have three weeks to respond in writing.  Living Rent tenant\u0027s union were yesterday supporting a refugee whose fate has been left undecided by the plans.  Khalil, who is originally from Iran, has lived in the city for three years after a traumatic journey to Britain.  The 34-year-old had to walk for seven days from Iran through Turkey before getting on the back of a lorry, which ended up in Manchester.  He was physically assaulted during the journey before eventually being sent to Glasgow by the Home Office.  He said: \u0026ldquoI feel safe in Glasgow. I can relate it to my original home because it has a proper community like back home.  \u0026ldquoBut I live day to day as my situation can change at a moments notice. The waiting is too much, three years I have waited, the hardest thing is waiting.  \u0026ldquoPhysiologically it takes it toll, I came here not for money or to take, I came here for safety and to work and provide for myself\"  \"Glasgow is my second home, my first home has been destroyed. I\u0027ve made friends here and built a life here. The only issue I have is with the Home office process and the length of time it takes. I just want my rights, I just want to live in peace and work and provide for myself.  Khalil is one of hundreds to have received a letter from Serco informing him of plans which will potentially make him homeless.  He added: \u0026ldquoI have no rights I have nowhere to go, what am I supposed to do?  \u0026ldquoI\u0027m putting my appeals and all the paperwork into the Home Office for my interview and then to be told I\u0027m to be made homeless was devastating\"  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove had no official help, from anyone at all. The people of Glasgow have been the ones who have helped me the most.  Members of tenants union Living Rent, visited Khalil\u0027s home to voice their opposition to Serco\u0027s plans.  Craig Paterson, spokesperson for the union, said: \"We have come here today to support Khalil and to show him and SERCO the strength of of feeling in Glasgow.  \"We fully intend to defend our neighbours and our communities by any and all means necessary\"  Shelter Scotland\u0026rsquos principal solicitor Fiona McPhail, said: \u0026ldquoShelter Scotland is pleased that the case brought on behalf of two clients has been continued and we will be able to challenge the so-called \"lock change\" evictions planned by Serco. We will be back in Glasgow Sheriff Court in 21 days.  \u0026ldquoThe nature of the proceedings of this stage, was for interim orders, which are effectively an emergency prohibition or prevention.  \u0026ldquoBecause there\u0026rsquos an undertaking that no action is going to be taken, which we believe is in part of the legal proceedings raised by us and others over the weekend, those orders weren\u0026rsquot necessary.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot yet say how long this will take and how the court will view our different arguments but at this stage we\u0026rsquove got an agreement there will be no action for 21 days, we\u0026rsquoll be back here and we\u0026rsquoll be update further at that stage.  Miss McPhail said Shelter were instructed on August 3, and the position is that 21 days isn\u0026rsquot going to be enough to have the areas of law clarified.  The legal arguments are complex and Shelter asked for longer, but the court granted 21 days.  She said: \u0026ldquoWhat the court have asked is for the other side to state their defence to the case so the court and us have an understanding of their position in writing.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a massive temporary victory for these six individuals and we know from the statement issued on Saturday that everyone else will not be served notices while these legal issues are clarified.  Govan Law Centre is preparing to go ahead with the hearing on interim interdict at the Court of Session today against Serco and the secretary of the state for the Home Office.

So what do this year\u0026rsquos results actually tell us?  The flagship qualification of Scottish education is the Higher and this year\u0026rsquos results continue a pattern emerging since it was revamped in 2015 under the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE).  This suggests that Higher enrolments and successes have declined slowly, but steadily - in contrast with the period from 2000 to 2014 when Higher numbers improved.  It will be another year or two before a fuller picture is evident, but since no other initiatives have affected Higher since 2000, it seems reasonable to ask whether CfE and the new qualifications are linked to this pattern.  Higher and other late-school qualifications such as Advanced Higher are built on a platform generated by earlier schoolwork and there is still much uncertainty about the results of CfE and the results of this may be clearly seen in the 2018 National 3 to 5 results.  Overall attainment in Scotland at these levels is now down nearly 34 per cent on the last pre-CfE results in 2013 which is a highly significant decline which cannot be explained away as a result of the narrowed S4 curriculum adopted by many of Scotland\u0026rsquos secondary schools since 2013.  Several issues are hidden inside the global figures. The numbers of pupils attempting National 4 and, especially, National 3 have crashed since 2013.  Whereas over 60,000 pupils passed a National 3 course in 2013, only 16,138 did so in 2018.  It does not look as if this is a result of improved learning and teaching which is helping pupils to achieve National 4 or National 5 instead, with significant reductions in the numbers attempting these qualifications over the same period.  Indeed the latest figures show a reduction in entries at National 5 of 12,000 in this year alone.  This is significant because this is the first major drop since 2014 and would appear to suggest that the opportunities to study courses at National 5 have been reduced.  Because CfE encourages pupils to spend longer in the so-called broad general education in the first three years of secondary it means in many schools they do a smaller number of subjects once pupils reach S4.  This is a trend that seems to be growing with a greater number of schools now offering only six courses whereas previously the offer was more likely to be seven or eight.  There are more alarm bells in the pass rates for National 5. Part of the two per cent decline in the pass rate this year is likely to be because of the removal of teacher assessments which might have been more favourable to pupils in the past.  But there is another issue of pupils being put into the wrong level of qualification because of misplaced school or parental expectation.  One particularly worrying aspect of the National 5 numbers is that, whereas only one pupil in 11 failed such courses in 2013, it is now the case that one child in four fails.  Such a failure rate is doing an injustice to pupils and society in general.  In the case of higher ability pupils, the declines identified at National 5 and Higher represent a challenge to their ability to enter university, find high-value jobs or contribute to the economic progress of the country.

Normally so easy-going, the Celtic manager has been spiky, not quite as open as before and at times downright sullen.  Yesterday he made it clear that a manager and squad which had delivered two trebles, record derby wins, successive Champions League group stage campaign and a full stadium deserves more from the board.  Look at all those triumphs and yet signing a Hibs player has become a chore.  After chatting about this and that, Rodgers was asked for his view on transfers and where his squad is.  \u0026ldquoSo we done the first part with Kieran and Tom. We sign, which is a no-brainer, Odsonne Edouarrd,  \u0026ldquoHe was on loan and we could see his qualities and now he looks like he is going to kick on and keep improving and developing but there are still a few key areas where I want to bring in quality and thus far we haven\u0026rsquot completed on it - not a lot of players,but we needed quality.  \u0026ldquoAnd that is something that we haven\u0026rsquot got in the building yet to add to the quality that is already here. You have to do that when you are in a strong position. I am not sure the club has been in a stronger position this summer than what they have been for quite some time.  Q: If you stand still, it can be seen to go backwards.  BR: \u0026ldquoAbsolutely. 150%. I couldn\u0026rsquot agree more. We need to complete deals. It is as simple as that. One is identifying the players which we do and then get them over the line.  Q: Regarding John McGinn, do you see why people would think the club should put money on the table and get the deal done?  BR: \u0026ldquo150%. If you open your door to players in general and they have an opportunity to go through that door and have a look and see that there are other good clubs with facilities and are equal \u0026ndash and probably better \u0026ndash than what is here, then you risk the chance of them not coming back though the door. That is the gamble you take if you wait.  Q: Did you expect more to be done by now?  BR: \u0026ldquoI just wanted quality. We weren\u0026rsquot needing a huge overhaul here this summer. For me it was pretty straightforward.  Is it reading between the lines to suggest you are frustrated?  Q: BR: \u0026ldquoI am fine.  Are you looking to get quality before the end of the window?  BR: \u0026ldquoI would hope so. We identify the targets and like I say we just hope that they can be completed.  Q: Are you happy with the reasons given for quality not being here?  BR: \u0026ldquoWhatever I feel will always be private. I will never speak openly on that.  Q: Will the English market closing (Friday) reduce prices?  BR: \u0026ldquoI am not sure. I think we will see how it all evolves down south when the window shuts. My concern is not that side of it but rather on getting quality in. That is the business side.  \u0026ldquoI run football and operate football and I want top footballers in and I want to work with them as quickly as I possibly can.  Q: Do you want more than projects...proven players?  BR: \u0026ldquoYes. Talents are fine. All my career I have done that, worked with talents, improving 19-year-olds, 20-year-olds, 17-year-olds, 18-year-olds\u0026hellipI have put them in. But you also need proven talent.  \u0026ldquoThere is an expectation here to work not just alongside the talents but to have proven talents that will allow us to grow.  \u0026ldquoThis is the best time for improvement and you can\u0026rsquot just wait and sit back.  \u0026ldquoYou have got to keep improving and developing and that is something that we need to do. That is a constant thing, not just every other year.  Q: A persistent criticism of Celtic is that the club doesn\u0026rsquot build from a position of strength.  BR: \u0026ldquoWell, we\u0026rsquore in a position of strength. So we shall see.  Q: Would you have liked the Edouard deal done quicker?  BR: Of course, a year earlier when he was available, there was an availability there for that. But, like I say, it wasn\u0026rsquot done. The most important thing is that it got done. You see then when you deliver that quality, that level.  \u0026ldquoListen, I always respect that there is a balance because we\u0026rsquore now in the market with the resources to go and spent nine, ten, eleven million pounds on every player you sign. You can\u0026rsquot do that.  \u0026ldquoBut I think we\u0026rsquove earned, over the few years, the possibilities to \u0026ndash where the squad needs the actual real genuine quality \u0026ndash the ability to do that. So hopefully we can.  Q: Are you any closer to Daniel Arzani?  \u0026ldquoNot that I\u0026rsquom aware of, no. I think it\u0026rsquos something that\u0026rsquos between Manchester City and Celtic.  Q: Can you tell us the position as it stands with John McGinn?  \u0026ldquoNo, other than they\u0026rsquove been working on it for the last few months. At this moment I don\u0026rsquot have anything further to add. Clearly Aston Villa have come in and maybe found an agreement with Hibs, I assume, which is why they would let him travel.  \u0026ldquoAnd he\u0026rsquos taken the opportunity to go and have a look and see. What he\u0026rsquoll find is that it\u0026rsquos a very good club that\u0026rsquos now been taken over by owners that look like they really want to back what they\u0026rsquore doing now. They have a wonderful stadium and a great, great training facility.  Rodgers then moved on to how Celtic works.  BR: \u0026ldquoUltimately, it will always go down to the board, which it is at most clubs. The board and everyone are fully understanding and clear and have clarity on my ambitions. Absolutely.  \u0026ldquoMy ambitions are always for Celtic. For the club and the supporters to have success.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the club have to balance that off with everything else that goes with running a football club. I\u0026rsquom not privy to the real depths of the business side of it.  \u0026ldquoYou guys know as much as me in terms of the club and the operation. We\u0026rsquove got a board who want to look after the interests of the club and I respect that.  \u0026lsquoThey respect that I am ambitious for Celtic. For the 60-odd thousand who turn up every week and for the millions around the world, we want to deliver the very, very best that we can.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the club want to do that within their means. That\u0026rsquos where we are at. I love it here. I love my work. I love working with the players, developing the team.  \u0026ldquoWe just try to push the very best we can to deliver on the expectation of what the supporters want."},{"url":null,"title":"record-number-of-scots-secure-a-place-at-university","story":"  New figures show 28,970 Scots will go on to higher education - up four per cent on the previous year.  Moves to widen access to students from the poorest backgrounds have also been given a boost.  This year, 4,340 students from the most deprived areas were placed \u0026ndash 14.6 per cent of all Scottish applicants - compared to 4,150 last year.  However, there was a decline in the number of students from the rest of the European Union following the Brexit vote - which makes the future for EU students much more uncertain.  The figures are produced by university admissions service UCAS every year to coincide with the release of Scottish exam results.  Liam McCabe, president of NUS Scotland, welcomed the rise in students from deprived backgrounds, but said further progress was required.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhile it is encouraging to see a modest rise in the proportion of acceptances for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, we can\u0026rsquot lose sight of the fact there is much more to do to ensure more students from the poorest areas make it into higher education.  \u0026ldquoWe need to see every institution - without exception - pulling their weight to change the current culture and boost admissions for these students.  Commenting on the fall in acceptances for EU students, he added: \u0026ldquoAs Brexit draws nearer the UK Government must work more closely with the Scottish Government and our universities and colleges to protect all students from the impacts of Brexit.  John Swinney, the Education Secretary, also welcomed the figures.  He said: \u0026ldquoThese show we are making good progress on widening access with the number of students from Scotland\u0026rsquos most deprived areas accepted into university increasing to a record high for the third year in a row.  \u0026ldquoThis increase has been achieved at the same time as the total number of Scottish students from all backgrounds getting a place at a Scottish university has hit a new record.  \u0026ldquoWe know that there is still much to do in closing the attainment gap and in widening access, but this is welcome progress.  Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, which represents principals, said the increase in Scots getting a place was \u0026ldquogreat news.  He added: \u0026ldquoA big success story which shouldn\u0026rsquot be ignored is the rising number of students from the most deprived backgrounds attending universities - this has more than doubled since 2009.  John Kemp, interim chief executive of the Scottish Funding Council, said the figures showed positive progress in key areas.  He said: \u0026ldquoThese results show overall demand for higher education remains strong for Scottish students despite a decrease in the number of pupils in fifth and sixth year.  \u0026ldquoA number of applicants are still waiting to be placed through the clearing process, so a fuller picture is likely to emerge at the end of the applications cycle in a few weeks.  Shona Struthers, chief executive of Colleges Scotland, said pupils should also consider the range of options available in further education - including courses that lead on to university.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe would urge those who have not yet decided what to do next to contact their local college for advice and support.  \u0026ldquoColleges are increasingly becoming the first choice for people as there are a wide range of opportunities that lead to successful careers or further study available at colleges across Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"how-a-modern-day-tufty-club-scheme-has-helped-red-squirrel-numbers-soar","story":"  Thanks to the Tufty Fluffytail series of public information films, the red squirrel has become one of Britain\u0026rsquos national icons.  Now, the threatened species has enjoyed a big population boost in the Highlands thanks to a road safety campaign launched on its behalf.  Conservationists have revealed that a specially designed rope bridge slung between trees high over a road in Wester Ross has dramatically cut the number of squirrels being killed by cars.  Together with nearby road signs alerting drivers to the squirrels\u0026rsquo presence, it is believed the suspension bridge has helped a colony of the vulnerable animals to thrive.  Charity Trees for Life installed the bridge over a road near Shieldaig last summer as part of its project to reintroduce the species to the northwest Highlands.  The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig, which is part of the hugely popular North Coast 500 tourist route, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, which is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian Forest.  Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, only one known red squirrel death has been reported on the road, with none reported so far in 2018this year.  In the year prior to the safety measures, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area, with another two on another nearby road.  And, over the same period, two litters of red squirrels have been born that is helping to bolster the local population.  Becky Priestley, Trees for Life\u0026rsquos wildlife officer, said: \u0026ldquoSadly, road traffic is a major risk for wildlife \u0026ndash including red squirrels.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it.  \u0026ldquoWe also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.  The Peoples Trust for Endangered Species says an estimated one million mammals are killed on UK roads each year.  Saving Scotland\u0026rsquos Red Squirrels, a partnership led by the Scottish Wildlife Trust, has also said in recent years that three per cent of red squirrel sightings recorded via its website are of animals dead on roads, with the actual figure believed to be higher.  Estimates suggest there are only 120,000 red squirrels left in Scotland, which is the UK stronghold for the species.  The main threat to their survival comes from the alien grey squirrel, which was introduced from North America in the 1800s.  Larger greys can out-compete their native counterparts for food and nest sites, while also spreading diseases such as squirrel pox. The disease causes no harm to invasive greys but is deadly to reds.  Squirrel pox has helped destroy 95% of native reds in England and Wales since 1952.  For the last three years, Trees for Life has been carefully relocating red squirrels from their strongholds in Inverness-shire and Moray to isolated fragments of suitable Highland forests where reds would once have lived, but to which they cannot return on their own.  The reintroduced populations have been seen exploring their new woodland homes, and have been breeding and spreading into new areas.  Numerous young squirrels have been sighted at the release sites throughout 2018.

Asked about the implications for her scheduled update on a second referendum, she said: \u0026ldquoLet\u0026rsquos not get ahead of ourselves. We\u0026rsquoll see where we get to in October.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoMy focus is on trying to use whatever influence I can to get us into a position where the whole of the UK is not taking a massive leap off a cliff-edge next March with a blindfold on.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoPresumably when we get to\u0026nbspOctober I\u0026rsquoll give an update. What the content of that update is, by definition, I don\u0026rsquot know right now.    Ms Sturgeon stressed her decision depended not just on the UK striking a withdrawal agreement, but also on it setting out detailed plans for future relations with\u0026nbsp Brussels, a recently added pre-condition.\u0026nbsp  She said: \u0026ldquoThe Prime Minister said she is still planning to be in a position where there is a detailed statement on the future relationship in October. I\u0026rsquoll leave everybody to draw their own conclusions as to how we get from here to there, given the state of things just now, but that\u0026rsquos what she\u0026rsquos just told me, so we\u0026rsquoll see where we get to.  The First Minister called a second referendum in March 2017 because of Brexit, but then \u0026ldquoreset her plans after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election.\u0026nbsp  In June last year, she said she planned to update MSPs on \u0026ldquothe precise timetable for offering people a choice over the country\u0026rsquos future this autumn, although this was contingent on the UK finishing its negotiations with the EU, \u0026ldquowhen the terms of Brexit will be clearer.  Ms Sturgeon also said she could not back Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers deal for a soft Brexit that kept common rules on goods and agri-foods but not services or migration.  She would not support a deal that \u0026ldquoshafted Scotland\u0026rsquos service-based economy, she said.    After talking with Mrs May, Ms Sturgeon said it was still unclear if the Chequers plan was a starting point for talks with Europe or a final offer, and she feared there was an \u0026ldquoawful long distance between the UK and Europe on avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland.  Ms Sturgeon also attacked former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson over his remarks that Muslim women wearing the veil look like \u0026ldquoletter boxes and \u0026ldquobank robbers.  She said the comments were a \u0026ldquodisgraceful and deliberate \u0026ldquodog whistle to the right, and urged Mrs May to condemn Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoIslamophobia.  However in a media briefing, Mrs May repeatedly refused to condemn Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos words in those terms, saying merely that they had caused offence and merited an apology.  Mrs May and Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos meeting, convened on the margins of a signing ceremony for a \u0026pound1.2bn City Deal for Edinburgh, was their first face-to-face encounter since March.  In the months since, relations between Edinburgh and London have nosedived because of profound disagreements over devolution and the constitution, including a UK challenge at the Supreme Court on the validity of Holyrood\u0026rsquos alternative Brexit Bill.  After the meeting, Mrs May insisted the Chequers plan would deliver a good deal for all of the UK, and called on the SNP to get behind it, not \u0026ldquosow division.\u0026nbsp  She said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out a clear proposal in the Chequers plan that delivers on the Brexit vote while protecting jobs and livelihoods in the UK. That\u0026rsquos important for all parts of the UK.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore negotiating [with the EU] as the United Kingdom.\u0026nbsp I think it\u0026rsquos incumbent on all parts of the United Kingdom to be supporting the proposals that we\u0026rsquore putting forward in their interaction with Brussels.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos important we see those proposals being supported rather than, sadly, what I fear what we see here, which is an attempt to sow the politics of division.  International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said on Sunday, who previously predicted a deal would be the \u0026ldquoeasiest in the world, said the odds of a chaotic no deal were now 60-40.    Mrs May ducked questions on whether she agreed with his assessment.  Ms Sturgeon said on Monday the negotiating \u0026ldquoscare tactic only made a no deal more likely.\u0026nbsp  Official analyses have suggested a no deal, in which the UK crashed out of the EU with a future relationship on trade and customs agreed, could damage the economy, lead to log-jams at the ports, create food and drug shortages, and potentially lead to civil unrest.  Professor Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University said he expected a second referendum to be \u0026ldquokicked into the long grass.  He told the Courier newspaper: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very contingent on Brexit. I think at the moment the odds are against it, but probably only marginally.  He said if the SNP was planning a referendum, Ms Sturgeon would have been much more politically active this summer, rather than keeping a fairly low profile.  He added: \u0026ldquoIf you make the assumption that Ms Sturgeon wants to remain first minister until at least May 2021 \u0026ndash and if you also make the not unreasonable assumption that if she holds an early referendum and loses she\u0026rsquos out \u0026ndash you can see that she has a strong disincentive at the moment to go (for Indyref2).  Ms Sturgeon said she respected Prof Curtice but he \u0026ldquodoes not live inside my head.  Mrs May would almost certainly reject another call for a second independence referendum if Ms Sturgeon were to ask for one, especially given her reliance on the DUP at Westminster.  However even a rejection could be useful to Ms Sturgeon, as she could claim it as evidence of the UK treating Scotland with contempt in the run-up to the 2021 Holyrood election.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-urged-to-act-on-bed-blocking","story":"  Official statistics reveal 1,436 people were delayed in being discharged from hospital when a census was taken in June, up 10% from 1,300 in June 2017.  Delayed discharge \u0026ndash also known as bed blocking \u0026ndash occurs when patients are fit to leave hospital but are unable to, often due to a lack of social care.  Age Scotland said older people put off going into hospital for fear of becoming \u0026ldquostuck in the system and called on ministers to act.  Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said nearly \u0026pound500 million is going to health and social care to drive down delayed discharge.  Of those patients affected in the June census, the vast majority \u0026ndash 1,187 \u0026ndash were delayed for more than three days.  For almost three-quarters (74%) this was due to health and social care issues, followed by having complex needs for 23% and patients and family reasons in 3% of cases.  A total of 573 patients at the census point were delayed for more than four weeks while 28 had been waiting to leave for more than a year.  The daily average number of beds blocked rose for the sixth consecutive month to 1,413.  In total, patients spent 42,375 days in hospital due to delayed discharge in June, up 8% from 39,252 in June 2017.  Age Scotland claimed this increase would cost around \u0026pound727,000, based on an average of \u0026pound233 a day.  Chief executive Brian Sloan said: \u0026ldquoAround four in 10 people who are ready to leave hospital are waiting more than a month to do so. This is scandalous.  \u0026ldquoKeeping people in hospital longer than necessary delays the start of their recovery, puts them at risk of infections, causes loss of mobility and can have a devastating effect on their mental health.  Ms Freeman said: \u0026ldquoJune has seen a 2% decrease in bed days lost to delay compared with the previous month.  \u0026ldquoDuring 2017/18, we achieved a 7% reduction in bed days lost to delay and we are looking to continue that overall progress this year.  \u0026ldquoTo support that, we have transferred nearly half a billion pounds from the NHS into social care and integration this financial year, and the health budget will increase by almost \u0026pound2 billion 2021."},{"url":null,"title":"oil-giants-face-new-campaign-to-root-out-corruption","story":"  Global Witness launched what it called a groundbreaking new tool called Finding The Missing Millions to check whether corporate giants, including North Sea operators, are delivering on promises of tax.  The group said payments from firms such as Shell, BP and Glencore amount to hundreds of billions of dollars and are a vital source of government revenue.  Yet Global Witness added that all too often the money gets siphoned off by elites instead of benefitting people in resource-rich countries.  Now big companies in Europe and Canada have to publish their payments.  This data can be used to check if money gets to communities.  Dominic Eagleton, senior campaigner at Global Witness, explained: \u0026ldquoScrutinising payment data from extractive companies has the power to change the lives of millions of people around the world.  \u0026ldquoThis is money for investing in hospitals, doctors, medicines, teachers, schools, universities, roads and railways.  \u0026ldquoFinding The Missing Millions will help people use these game-changing new disclosures to hold governments and industry accountable for vital public funds.  The handbook features 10 different methods for using data from oil, gas and mining projects to check whether companies are paying the right amount to governments. Each method features \u0026ldquoreal life case studies to show how this can be done.  One example looks at payments that are earmarked for development projects to benefit mining-affected communities in South Goa, India. The payments were due to be transferred by the mining company Vedanta to a local district authority.  Previously, a lack of transparency made it impossible for local people to know how much they were owed from Vedanta\u0026rsquos mine, and to follow the money into government accounts. By using a method shown in the handbook, the group revealed that Vedanta owed $2.1 million (\u0026pound1.6m) to local communities.  Mr Eagleton added: \u0026ldquoSecrecy in the oil and mining industries has enabled corrupt elites to loot hundreds of billions of dollars while people in resource-rich countries live in poverty.  \u0026ldquoRevenue transparency can help put an end to this scandal, but the full benefits will only be realised if people actively use the data. Citizens, campaigners, journalists and others can now take advantage of this important new tool to hold the industry accountable, and ultimately ensure that communities reap the full benefits from their resources."},{"url":null,"title":"early-viewing-figures-positive-for-glasgow-2018","story":"  Germany\u0027s public-service broadcaster has reported more than two million viewers over the first five days of the inaugural European Championships, with positive numbers also coming from France.

Experts who took part in the biggest study yet comparing medical treatments for ADHD agreed that many British children with the condition were falling below the\u0026nbsp diagnostic radar and\u0026nbsp not getting the help they need.  They were also keen to dispel the myth that ADHD drugs such as methylphenidate, or Ritalin, were a form of\u0026nbsp \u0026ldquochemical cosh and children would be better off with less treatment.  David Coghill, Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Royal Children\u0026rsquos Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026nbspthink we have quite strong evidence to suggest that \u0026ndash in the UK and many countries outside the US \u0026ndash ADHD is under recognised and under diagnosed,\u0026nbspand if you don\u0026rsquot recognise and diagnose someone you don\u0026rsquot have the option of what treatment they receive.  ADHD is a brain disorder characterised by hyperactivity, impulsivity, and an inability to maintain attention. It affects both children and an estimated 2.5% of adults worldwide and can seriously impair quality of life.  Contrary to popular belief, the cause of the condition is under-activity rather than excess activity of certain parts of the brain. All drugs prescribed for ADHD,\u0026nbspwhich include amphetamines, are stimulants, not sedatives.  The new study conducted by a large team of international experts reviewed a wealth of data from 133 trials around the world looking at the effectiveness and tolerability of ADHD drugs.  Around 24,000 patients took part in the trials, including 14,000 children.  After sifting through data, including unpublished results that took four years to collect, the authors concluded Ritalin remained the best medical option for children with ADHD.  In the case of adults, amphetamines turned out to be the most effective treatment that was acceptable to patients.  Ritalin is already recommended as a first line treatment for children with ADHD by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which vets the cost effectiveness of treatments in England and Wales.  The findings are published in the journal The Lancet Psychiatry.  Speaking at a new briefing in London, members of the research team said it was important to realise that children with ADHD were not simply displaying bad behaviour.  Prof Coghill said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe now have very clear evidence that the brains of children with ADHD both structurally and functionally are very different.  \u0026ldquoThat results in a wide range of cognitive difficulties, of difficulties of impulse control, keeping attention.  \u0026ldquoThe medication treatments are very effective at improving those functional deficits as well as reducing the core symptoms.  He also stressed the consequences of having ADHD were \u0026ldquofar from benign.  Children with the disorder were far more likely than average to suffer accidents, and adults were at greater risk from traffic accidents either as pedestrians or motorists.  Crime rates were also unusually high among ADHD sufferers.  Co-author Professor Emily Sminoff, from King\u0026rsquos College London, said: \u0026ldquoClinicians are very cautious about using medication in this country.  \u0026ldquoThe problem in the UK is predominantly about under-recognition and diagnosis across a range of conditions.  \u0026ldquoAs a result there are a number of children suffering with a range of mental health disorders who could benefit from treatment."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-calls-on-nicola-sturgeon-to-back-brexit-deal-and-not-sow-the-politics-of-division","story":"  The Prime Minister insisted all parts of the United Kingdom should support the Chequers deal, agreed by the cabinet on Britain\u0026rsquo departure from the European Union.

Liam Fox, the UK Government\u0026rsquos International Trade Secretary, recently put the chances of this happening as 60-40 \u0026ndash blaming European \u0026ldquointransigence for the situation.  Ms Sturgeon said afterwards: \u0026ldquoMy concern about the increasing prospect of a no deal Brexit certainly wasn\u0026rsquot allayed in that meeting.  \u0026ldquoWe discussed obviously the position around the Chequers agreement. The Prime Minister\u0026rsquos position continues to be that she thinks Chequers is the basis of an agreement on the future relationship, notwithstanding that everybody else thinks that it\u0026rsquos not.  Mrs May, however, insisted her government was \u0026ldquoworking to get a good deal for the whole of the United Kingdom, in Brexit talks with Europe.  The Prime Minister stated: \u0026ldquoWe set out a clear proposal in the Chequers plan, that delivers on the Brexit vote, that does so while protecting jobs and livelihoods in the UK, that ensure we deliver on free movement in the future, the ending of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, but that we are able to do so while maintaining good trading relationships with the European Union, that\u0026rsquos important for all parts of the UK.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore now sitting down\u0026nbspand discussing those proposals with the European Union and we\u0026rsquore negotiating as a United Kingdom.  The Scottish Government has repeatedly called for the UK to remain in both the European single market and the customs union after leaving the EU.  Tensions between the two administrations have also become more frayed after the Scottish Government refused to back the European Withdrawal Bill, instead passing its own Brexit contigency legislation \u0026ndash with the Supreme Court currently considering a Westminster challenge to this.  Mrs May was clear she wanted all parts of the UK to support the Chequers deal that her cabinet had agreed on.  \u0026ldquoI think it is incumbent on all parts of the United Kingdom to be supporting the proposals that we\u0026rsquore putting forward in their interaction with Brussels, she said.  \u0026ldquoI think it important we see those proposals being supported, rather than sadly what I fear we see here which is an attempt to sow the politics of division.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore working to get a good deal, we\u0026rsquove put forward a proposal that delivers on the Brexit vote, that protects jobs and livelihoods here in the UK, that will be good for all parts of the United Kingdom, that ensures we have that clear good trading relationship in the future with the European Union, and that delivers on other issues people want.  Asked if she would accept any request from the Scottish Government to hold a second independence referendum, Mrs May said the focus should be on delivering for the UK.  The Prime Minister said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish people voted in 2014, they had a referendum, they gave a clear decision they wanted Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom.  \u0026ldquoI believe what we should be doing now is working and getting on with the job of delivering on the future of the United Kingdom, that\u0026rsquos about Brexit, it is about getting a good Brexit deal, it is about all the other issues like the industrial strategy, like the city deals.  \u0026ldquoWhat I want to see is the Scottish Government also putting forward their support for proposals we have put forward to the European Union that will deliver on the vote, but would also deliver for Scotland and the rest of the UK.

Scottish Conservative MSP Peter Chapman this week challenged First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to tell farmers if she is in favour of the restrictions planned for the route and urged her to support overturning the ban.                                                    His comments came as Ms Sturgeon visited Turriff Show, Scotland’s second biggest agricultural event after the Royal Highland Show.                                                    Mr Chapman has written to Transport Scotland to seek clarity after local officials suggested that the bypass would be granted “special road” status, excluding agricultural vehicles.        The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response. I would urge Nicola Sturgeon to speak up on behalf of our local farmers so that common sense can prevail and this ill-thought ban is lifted.”                                                                                                        Local SNP MSP Gillian Martin said that a public consultation regarding the route had been carried out in 2007 although views can still be put to Transport Scotland.She added: “I believe the NFU Scotland did submit to that. It’s unclear whether a call for access to agricultural vehicles was included in their submission at that point. However it has been suggested at the Turriff Show by MSPs present that if individual farmers believe they will be severely disadvantaged by not being able to access the new road and continue to use only the existing road network, that they make that case to Transport Scotland.”                                                                    "},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116798.jpg","title":"Caithness estate with links to royal family to be sold at auction","story":"A CAITHNESS estate with links to the royal family and rock and pop stars is to be sold at auction next month.The Dunnet Head Estate, comprising 1800 acres of land and the House of the Northern Gate, was initially put on the market in February for \u0026pound925,000.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Auction House Scotland, which is dealing with the transaction, yesterday described the price reduction as \u0026ldquoone of our biggest ever.She said: \u0026ldquoSince the latest reduction on Friday the amount of interest in the estate has increased tenfold with enquiries coming mostly from the UK.Asked why the estate is being sold, she replied: \u0026ldquoThe current owner has had it for a long time and felt it was time to sell up and move on.The estate includes six lochs, a beach, approved planning for 10 timber lodges and a detached house as well as the 10-bedroom House of the Northern Gate.It was owned by Commander Clare Vyner and his wife Lady Doris Vyner, who was the Queen Mother\u0026rsquos close friend and lady-in-waiting. While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Wednesday 8 Aug 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

NHS Highland recently approved the move to public consultation, which has been widely welcomed.The preferred option includes the development of a proposed care hub/village at the Dunbar Hospital site in Thurso and the Pulteney House care home site in Wick.The plans also include a multimillion-pound upgrade for Caithness General as part of an overall \u0026pound30 million investment for the area.The option of developing Wick\u0026rsquos Town and County Hospital will also be included in the consultation.The Wick event will be held on Monday, August 20, between 6pm and 7pm, while the Thurso one takes place the following evening at the same time.People planning to attend either should contact Christian Nicolson of NHS Highland on 07870513114 or email christian.nicolson@nhs.net to help ensure adequate seating can be provided.The health authority says further events will be arranged in due course and dates will be widely publicised.Wednesday 8 Aug 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

track","story":"\u0026nbspMULTI-million pound efforts to improve water supplies in Ross-shire have been welcomed by a local MP.Jamie Stone visited a Scottish Water site near Evanton this week to view progress on a \u0026pound5.5 million project to improve security of the water supply for customers across much of Easter Ross and beyond.Work at the site has been underway since February this year and is expected to be complete in early 2019.A new tank is being built with a capacity to store up to eight million litres of drinking water, improving security of supply for around 30,000 customers across Easter Ross, Dingwall and the Black Isle.The work is being carried out by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD, in partnership with contractor Coffey Construction.After seeing the work in progress and receiving an update on Scottish Water\u0026rsquos current work across his Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency, Mr Stone said: \"The long period of dry weather this summer is a reminder that, even in the Highlands, water is a precious resource that we all rely on in countless ways.\"The work currently taking place will help to improve the security of water supply for Easter Ross in the event of any future issues at the water treatment works or disruption to the local water network.\u0026nbsp\"At the same time, it is good to hear of the work Scottish Water\u0026rsquos operational teams are currently carrying out across the north to maintain supplies and protect the local environment.\"Despite some recent rainfall, it is still important that we use water wisely to help lochs and reservoirs recover so that supplies can be maintained through the rest of the summer and beyond,\" he added.ESD project manager Kevin Williamson said the works remained on track for completion next year.He said: \"The work we are delivering reflects a significant investment for one of the key water supply areas in the Highlands, which serves communities right around the Cromarty Firth.\"Work on site is going well and we anticipate it will be complete early next year.\u0026nbsp\"Once in place, the new storage tank will give Scottish Water improved ability to carry out important maintenance work at the water treatment works, and deal with any short term issues affecting the local water network, without impact on customers\u0026rsquo water supply.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Scottish Water has urged customers to do what they can to conserve water amidst this year\u0026rsquos very dry summer.Its strategic customer service planning team Leader for the north, Jim Briggs, said: \"Separately from this longer term investment, we are continuing work in consultation with Sepa to manage water resources across the north following the prolonged period of dry weather.\"Despite some rainfall in many areas over the past week, our frontline teams are continuing to work hard to ensure we can maintain supplies to all of our customers.\"We continue to need customers to help us by using water wisely, for example by using a watering can instead of a hose in the garden and only using dishwashers and washing machines when fully loaded.\u0026nbsp\"The support of thousands of customers with these small and simple steps can make a big difference to maintaining water supplies for everyone and allowing water resources to recover when rainfall occurs.\"He added that the Evanton project will help to provide \"clear, fresh-tasting drinking water to our customers in a wide range of circumstances\".Wednesday 8 Aug 2018

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Wednesday 8 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Wednesday 8 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Wednesday 8 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A herd of dark-fleeced Hebridean sheep were brought on to the battle site in 2000 to graze on overgrown shrubbery.            Inverness councillor Duncan Macpherson is now asking the trust to bring the sheep back after the matter was brought to his attention by constituents.            Mr Macpherson said: “I fully understand the concerns of my constituents, as I walked the entire path and found it to be as overgrown as I was led to believe it was.“Other areas concerned me, such as the road leading up to the visitor centre, which is heavily potholed, which does not create a good welcome to one of our main tourist attractions.”He added: “We are trying to encourage people to come here, so I think it is in the best interests of the National Trust to attribute their resources as to how busy their tourist attractions are.“I would urge the National Trust for Scotland that it would be useful to make these changes which everybody will benefit from. It will add to the offering of Inverness by providing the much-needed tender love and care that the battlefield demands.”Black Isle Brewery operators David and JayJay Gladwin inherited the initial herd of dark-fleeced Hebridean sheep, which graze the fields of their organic farm, assisting in the production of the company’s beer.            Mr Gladwin said: “I would be delighted if I were asked. It would be nice for the sheep to return back to where they came from, a homecoming as such.”A spokesman for the NTS said: “We are grateful for the councillor’s suggestion and perhaps it is a case of great minds thinking alike.“Over the years we have used grazing animals to help us with managing the \u2028battlefield landscape – indeed we have some goats onsite now clipping down the vegetation in their own inimitable way.“We are interested in expanding this arrangement as grazing animals are not just a sustainable means of landscape management but also naturally return the battlefield to the kinds of conditions seen in 1746.            “To that end we are planning to revisit the management plan for Culloden in the near future and would welcome Councillor MacPherson to come and talk to us about it.”   "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4780264.1533673685!/image/image.jpg","title":"new suspension bridge keeps red squirrels safe in highlands","story":"        For decades they have been battling the deadly twin threats of deforestation and the dominance of their bitter rivals, the greys.                But for one local population of Scottish red squirrels, the extra risk of becoming roadkill is now less of a worry.            Conservationists are celebrating after a specially designed “squirrel bridge”, slung between trees high above a road in the north west Highlands, proved to be a resounding success.            Camera traps hidden on the rope bridge, which is suspended over the A896 near the village of Shieldaig in Wester Ross, have revealed that it is now something of a busy thoroughfare for reds.The crossing was installed last June by conservation charity Trees for Life as part of an ongoing project to reintroduce red squirrels to the area, where they were once common.Only 120,000 red squirrels are currently estimated to survive in Scotland, due to the widespread destruction of their forest habitats and the introduction of the grey squirrel to the UK in the nineteenth century.As well as outcompeting reds, grey squirrels are also carriers of the squirrel pox virus, to which they are immune but which is lethal to reds. READ MORE: Edinburgh vets develop new blood test for liver disease in dogs            To help them fight back, Trees for Life has been relocating small populations from their current strongholds in Inverness-shire and Moray to suitable forests in the north west Highlands. The project has seen 140 red squirrels released so far, including in the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland’s few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian Forest.Becky Priestley, Trees for Life’s wildlife officer, told The Scotsman the team were not sure whether the squirrels would take to the bridge. “I was delighted when I got down the camera traps and saw the photos,” she said. “As we were taking down the cameras, a red squirrel shot up one of the trees that the bridge was tied to, and I could see that she’d built a drey [nest] up there – that suggests there’s regular use of it.”Together with road signs alerting drivers to the squirrels’ presence, the rope bridge appears to have had a significant impact in reducing road deaths.

In the year before the measures were introduced, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the  area and two others further away.

Nicola Sturgeon has admitted that she doesn\u0026#8217t know what she will say about IndyRef2 when she updates the country about her Brexit plans in the autumn.                The First Minister has promised that she will make an announcement on her position on a second independence referendum in October.            Ms Sturgeon set the timetable, which corresponds with the SNP autumn conference, when she reset her indyref plans following her party’s loss of seats in last year’s snap General Election.            The timing of the announcement was contingent on the notion that the shape of the Brexit deal would have become clear by then.READ MORE: Theresa May hails £1.2bn city deal as ‘exciting step towards brighter future’But after meeting Theresa May in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said she had made next to no progress in finding out how the deal would work and was increasingly anxious about a no deal scenario.Ms Sturgeon said there was still “an awful long distance” between the UK and the EU and expressed doubts that a deal could be done by October.READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon ‘will kick IndyRef2 into the long grass’            “Presumably when we get to October I will give an update (on a second independence referendum). What the content of that update is, by definition, I don’t know right now,” Ms Sturgeon said.“The Prime Minister said today she is planning to be in a position where there will be a detailed statement on the future relationship by October. I leave everybody around the table to draw their own conclusions on how we get from here to there, given the state of things just now but that’s what she has just told me.”Earlier Ms Sturgeon said her discussions with Mrs May did not result in “a whole lot of information” that she didn’t have previously.“My concern about the prospect and the increasing prospect of a no deal Brexit certainly wasn’t allayed in that meeting.            “We discussed the progress around the Chequers agreement. The Prime Minister thinks Chequers is the basis of an agreement about the future relationship – not withstanding that everybody else thinks that it is not.“My most fundamental concern was seeing how much distance there still is between the UK and the EU on the Northern Irish back-stop, which is of course an essential component of the withdrawal agreement and without a withdrawal agreement in October we are facing no deal. So it seems to me an awful long distance between the two sides on that issue.”Ms Sturgeon said she asked the Prime Minister directly what her Plan B was if there was no withdrawal agreement by October.“There is no clear sense of that there is simply an insistence that situation won’t arise,” the First Minister said."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4780139.1533664063!/image/image.jpg","title":"alexander mccall smith what the who s who of scotland really tells us","story":"        The new edition of Who\u0026#8217s Who Scotland reveals notable Scots\u0026#8217 fondness for walking and travelling ... somewhere, writes Sandy McCall Smith.                Who’s Who in Scotland 2018 has just been published – at a price of £75  (a snip). It is not a book that will get a large number of reviews, I suspect, as many reviewers might find it difficult to find anything to say about it. What are they to write? “This book is short on plot but very strong on characters – there are 5,000 of them ...” Or, perhaps, “the alphabetical structure of Who’s Who in Scotland has much to recommend it ...”             This book, however, makes excellent reading and shows us just what a fascinating and peculiar country we live in. Take people’s private pursuits, for example: at the end of each entry there is a heading “recreations” and it is here that people disclose, usually in two or three words, what they get up to when they aren’t doing all the distinguished things mentioned in the main body of their entry. A trawl through the pages of Who’s Who in Scotland reveals that travel and walking are probably the most popular activities. Entrants do not disclose, though, where they are travelling to, nor indeed where they are walking and why. But distinguished Scots are certainly travelling and walking in great numbers.            READ MORE: Alexander McCall Smith: Should there be second referendums on Brexit and independence?Many of them state that their recreation is running. This is almost as popular as walking. Some of them may be running away from something, but this is not mentioned, which is probably just as well. One entrant, a politician, lists his recreations as rugby, family, and whisky (in that order). Jamie Byng, publisher of Canongate, reports his recreations as tennis, cooking, deejaying, reading, and drinking. Another, a minister of the Kirk, includes amongst his recreations wining and dining and visiting Vienna and York. Vienna and York would be tame destinations, though, for an earlier entry which records, amongst others, the following expeditions: East Greenland (1966) Elephant Island, Antarctica, 1970-71, and Everest in 1976.Recreations aside, it is encouraging to see that there are very large numbers of accomplished people in Scotland – undoubtedly rather more than one might expect in a country of Scotland’s size. If one is of the ‘wha’s like us’ school, one will find plenty of proof here of one’s thesis. After all, here we find Brown, Rt Hon (James) Gordon, Prime Minister Darling of Roulanish, Baron (Alistair Maclean Darling), Chancellor of the Exchequer and Higgs, Professor Peter Ware (recreations, music, walking and swimming) who started off with the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society in 1981 and ended up with the Nobel Prize in 2013. All three of these are people of immense achievement, but their entries are characteristically modest, which is encouraging. Scotland has never been noted for a fondness for bragging, and this is reflected in Who’s Who in Scotland. There is room for everybody in this volume, even those whose role in life is to be a local councillor or the deputy-head of a primary school. And why not? Civic life depends on people who undertake these roles. They may not be the most glamorous callings, but they are at the heart of our society and should be applauded, cherished, and duly recorded in books like this. Such people are worth any number of celebrities.  READ MORE: Famous discovery has ‘ruined my life’, says Professor HiggsThe gentry and above are here, all right, although they are, by and large, discreet – even diffident about their lineage. After all, Scottish nobles have been a somewhat rapacious lot throughout our history, and it is understandable that their descendants should limit themselves to only three or four lines in Who’s Who in Scotland. They often describe their occupation as farmer, but of course the real situation is given away by their recreations which are usually listed as hunting and fishing. The more tactful will write country sports, but we all know that does not include mah jong. Their addresses also reveal what’s what. They usually live in a House, or, quite often, a Castle. On the subject of addresses, the McEwens of Muck are not in this volume, which is a pity. The MacEwen family has the most wonderful address ever: McEwen, Muck, Scotland. And Andy Murray is not here either, which is odd, although everyone knows that his recreation is tennis."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4779627.1533580115!/image/image.jpg","title":"anna schneider are you prepared for the last year of your life","story":"        Too many older people are facing the most vulnerable stage in their adult lives alone, writes academic Anna Schneider.                Sorry to be the bearer of bad news – sooner or later, we’ll all reach the end of our lives. Many of us are not keen to face this event, nor the time that comes directly before. It’s actually hard to say what is the bigger taboo, death or the personal care that most of us receive in our final days and weeks.            According to the World Health Organisation, more than half of us die of an illness that requires some form of end of life care. Depending on your definitions, the figure can be much higher – a German study found it to be more like four out of five, which is in line with findings from my work in Scotland. Either way, care providers expect the absolute numbers of people in Western countries in need of end-of-life care to keep growing as populations continue to grow older in future.            As you might expect, older people have a higher chance of developing ailments that need care. The group of those experiencing a long period of dwindling physical and mental faculties due to frail old age or dementia is already rising: according to the death records that we examined in Scotland, for example, it doubled from 5.1 per cent in 2001-02 to 9.7 per cent in 2011-12, and dementia rates have continued to increase. The share of people undergoing shorter periods of decline, such as cancer patients, rose to 29.5 per cent of all deaths in 2011-12. These numbers are slightly higher than many other countries, but roughly comparable.Given these figures, you may wonder: what is life like at its end? Do people receive the care and support they need? The answer is, not everyone does. My colleague Iain Atherton and I mapped the last year of people’s lives in Scotland using a mixture of census data NHS data, and death records. Here’s what we found out.READ MORE: Private care home chief warns sector is ‘on the brink’We looked at all 53,517 people who died in Scotland within a year of the last census in 2011. About one in five were below pension age, half were aged 65-84, and just under a third were 85 or older. Every third person lived alone, and around 40 per cent were widowed. Not the ideal situation when you need care.The closer people were to dying, the more likely they were to have moved in with others. This varied by neighbourhood deprivation, however. In more deprived areas, 37 per cent of people aged 70 and over – those most likely to need care – still lived alone, even in the last four weeks of their lives. In the least deprived areas, the rate was 25 per cent. (In this age group as a whole, 18 per cent of people died in a care home.)            To my knowledge, nobody has come up with directly comparable figures for other countries. From Eurostat data from 2014, though, we do know that 32 per cent of over-65s in the EU live alone, for example, and that the UK is almost exactly in line with the average.Let’s be honest: few people find the idea of living alone in old age appealing, no matter what their health status. In many cases, it goes hand-in-hand with depending on external services for care – strangers that invade the innermost sphere of your privacy. It’s probably one of the major reasons why people don’t like talking about this stage of life.Yet if we want to make our last months and years of life less bleak, talking and acting is exactly what we need to do. As I have just discussed at a show at the Edinburgh Fringe on the subject, we should consider new options. We need to think outside the box, and ensure that we are the decision-makers instead of being pushed back into the role of dependent.READ MORE: Let elderly Scots keep beloved pets in care homes, says Labour            Are retirement villages an option, for example? Or better still, housing complexes with people from different generations, where even a frail grandad can help the neighbour’s boy with his homework and still feel part of the community? Or can you band together with some friends, either in one house or in adjacent flats?In many cases, care decisions are made ad hoc, because an immediate solution is required. When your mother has had yet another fall and it’s clear she can no longer stay on her own and needs a care home bed in two days when she comes out of the hospital, there is no time to find the best home for her. You must take the place that is available.Isn’t it funny that many of us tend to take out life insurance in case we die prematurely but don’t make provisions for the very likely possibility that we’ll need care? I doubt you look forward to your care home stay, the tightly scheduled visit of the district nurse, or the look on the face of your children when they need to decide whether they want to sell the house they grew up in to pay for better care for you.Rich or poor, man or woman, the clock is ticking for all of us. Too many older people are facing the most vulnerable stage in their adult lives alone, and the next generation needs to find ways of avoiding this situation. It’s not to say that governments and healthcare providers shouldn’t take responsibility for care – they do anyway – but if we blindly rely on them to provide, there are limits to what we will receive. Before it’s too late, it’s better that we also come up with plans of our own.            Anna Schneider is a research fellow in social policy at Edinburgh Napier University.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building.

As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion.

Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK.

This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nWednesday 8 Aug 2018 10:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

This keeps individuals on the right side of the wildlife protection laws, and helps ensure the best possible outcome for the kittens too.\"\nSWA project areas manager, Dr Roo Campbell, said: \"We are well into kitten season now and we have already had a number of inquiries relating to possible wildcats kittens, some in Badenoch and Strathspey.\n\"What we would say is that it is virtually impossible to tell whether kittens are tabby domestic cats or wildcat kitten at a young age.\n\"We wouldn\u0027t recommend making an assessment until around six months of age.\n\"A nursing mother wildcat will temporarily leave the kittens to go hunting and could be scared off by lots of human activity around the kittens.\"\nHe explained: \"When working with wild individuals held in captivity, we have the luxury of using the combined pelage (coat markings) and genetic scoring to assess whether an individual is a wildcat.\n\"If found in the wild, we would ensure that both tests are done before confirming whether they are wildcat kittens.\n\"Unfortunately, such is the poor status of the Scottish wildcat population, any kittens found are likely to be feral-hybrid cats than of wildcats.\n\"If suspected wildcat kittens are reported to SWA and they turn out to be wildcats then when it comes to returning these individuals to the wild it is important to ensure there exists a viable population in the same area and that risks such as hybridisation and disease have been mitigated against.\n\"In this context we would highlight that a suitable release location is one where there is a programme of trap neuter vaccinate and return of feral cats such as conducted by SWA.\"\nWednesday 8 Aug 2018 10:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116892.jpg","title":"Dual stretch of A9 is back in operation","story":"\u0026nbsp\nTHE dual carriageway on the new A9 stretch between Dalraddy and Aviemore has been re-opened to motorists after roadworks.\nThe timing of the works at the start of the summer was criticised by community and business leaders.\nThere were also claims that Transport Scotland had put off installing the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) cabling last year to allow them to open the dual \u0026ndash part of the \u0026pound3 billion flagship project \u0026ndash as pledged by the end of last summer.\nSeveral laybys still remain closed along the five mile stretch.\nThe road was reduced to single lanes in each direction with 50mph speed limits in place for most of the duration of the six weeks of the work.\nTourism leaders questioned why work could not have been done outwith the peak holiday season.\nWednesday 8 Aug 2018 10:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/02748000/02748487.jpg","title":"Spate of calls sparks Highland Council landlord reminders over private water supplies","story":"Staff Reporter\nLandlords\u0026nbspwhose tenants are fed water from private supplies are being urged to remember their responsibilities amid the dry summer conditions.\nLow water levels have been experienced on many rivers and burns as a result of the exceptional weather.\nAnd Highland Council has reminded owners of private water supplies and landlords of tenants on private water supplies that it is their responsibility to arrange for the provision of water to their properties.\nIt issued the reminder after its environmental health team received calls from a number of people to warn that their supplies were drying up.\nThe council warned that it is not required to provide water in these situations but that the responsibility is that of the owner or landlord.\nIt added that its environmental health team will offer advice and possible grants to bring medium to long term improvements in the private supply, including improving the volume of the supply or storage.\u0026nbsp\nIt can also request Scottish Water to assist but full costs will be recovered from the owner or landlord.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

paisley by election petition to be set up in three north antrim towns","story":"\nThe petition to remove Ian Paisley as North Antrim MP and force a by-election will be available for signing at three locations in the constituency, it has been confirmed.\n\n                \nIn a public notice in today’s News Letter, the Electoral Office reveals that the petition will be available to sign in north Antrim’s three main towns – Ballymena, Ballymoney and Ballycastle.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nIan Paisley has vowed to stand again for election if he is forced into a by-election\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMembers of the public who want to force a by-election – in which Mr Paisley has made clear he will stand for re-election – will be able to sign from 9am next Wednesday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe petition will be open to sign until 5pm each week day at the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney, the Seven Towers Leisure Centre in Ballymena and the Sheskburn House Recreation Centre in Ballycastle.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe petition will remain open to sign for six weeks, until 19 September.\n\nThere will also be evening signings – something required by the legislation governing recall petitions – on September 6 and 13, when the petition can be signed up until 9pm.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s Chief Electoral Officer, Virginia McVea – who is responsible for the process – had discretion under the Recall of MPs Act 2015 to designate up to 10 locations within the constituency for the petition to be signed.\n\nMeanwhile, the DUP has clarified that Ian Paisley has not left the party after some confusion yesterday in the wake of Parliament redesignating the North Antrim MP as an independent.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe party confirmed that Mr Paisley remained suspended, rather than having been expelled, and as part of that the party had withdrawn the whip from him.\n\nThat puts him in the same category as MPs such as Ivan Lewis, who is suspended by Labour and is listed as an independent.\n\nThe recall process was automatically triggered when Mr Paisley was given a suspension of 30 sitting days – the longest on record since at least 1949 – over “serious misconduct” relating to taking free luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then lobbying on behalf of the regime without declaring that they had given the valuable gifts to himself and his family.\n\nThe DUP veteran apologised for not declaring the holidays but insisted to Parliament’s standards commissioner that his letter asking the prime minister to change UK policy at the UN to that favoured by Sri Lanka did not amount to lobbying for the regime.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe petition to remove Mr Paisley will have to be signed by 7,547 people – 10% of the eligible North Antrim electorate – if there is to be a by-election.\n\nUnlike the situation with an election, any voter – not just those who can provide a legitimate reason for not being able to vote in person – will be able to apply to sign the petition by post.\n\nThat rule, about which DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has expressed concern, is in place because, unlike an election, it will be known that anyone going into the signing place will be there to sign the petition, reducing the typical anonymity around an election.\n\nParties wanting to campaign for people to sign the petition will have to register if they are planning to spend more than £500.\n\n

It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix. It is a region which he enjoys and which he hopes to visit again.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37184302.ece/7cf68/AUTOCROP/w140square/Belfast_Pride-006.jpg","title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In this way they could do more for politics than ever before.”\n\nHe said Sinn Fein did not “put their shoulder to the wheel” during the Brexit referendum and it was now time for Mary Lou McDonald to put “country before party”.\n\nElsewhere, police chiefs have acknowledged a risk to the British public from a hard Brexit. The Association of Police nad Crime Commissioners have written to the Home Secretary to express concern over what withdrawing from the EU will mean for security measures. \n\nThey warned that leaving the EU without an agreement on future relations would mean “a significant loss of operational capacity” because police would instantly lose access to cross-border investigative powers and access to databases.\n\nThe association says these concerns come as threats to the UK from abroad are increasing.\n\nTensions are rising as Britain tries to hammer out an agreement that can be approved by all the EU member states.\n\nThe cross-party Brexit working group has requested a meeting with Home Secretary Sajid Javid to discuss “preparations, contingencies and the financial implications of post-Brexit policing”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast pride parade 2018 thousands take to streets to celebrate","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I\u0027m a Limavady councillor and it\u0027s a separate issue which is unrelated to the current crisis,\" she said. \n\nMs Chivers said the MP\u0027s comments had left her \"aghast\" and \"angry\". \n\n\"I am not biased in any way and I think Gregory is being very unhelpful,\" she said. \n\n\"I represent everybody in the borough and that is why I want to see all flags removed and all kerbs restored.\"\n\nShe said no MLAs or MPs from any party were invited to the \"emergency meeting\", which sought to establish a united response and avoid an escalation.\n\n\"We were the first to condemn the appearance of nationalist graffiti and flags, our MLA Caoimhe Archibald promptly did that,\" she said. \n\nMs Chivers slammed the DUP\u0027s refusal to participate in the meeting as \"irresponsible\" and said Mr Campbell\u0027s comments were unbelievable, given that \"people are terrified\" in their homes.\n\nBut he said although the mayor claimed she would represent \"all the community\", nothing could \"disguise the facts which face people every day of the year\" in Dungiven.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself.

The official Linfield website says that their fans now have three options about how they will travel to the match.\n\nIt says individual supporters can still go on buses which will be laid on from Ballysillan, though they\u0027ll have to pay a £2 fee.\n\nIt also says organised groups, such as supporters clubs, can go in their own buses to the leisure centre and be escorted to Solitude.\n\nHowever, significantly, the website says under option number three \"supporters may travel to the ground using their own private transport and park in one of the designated areas at the away end of the stadium. Further information will be given to supporters on purchase of their match tickets\".\n\nLinfield said fans buying tickets for the game must advise the club which travel option they plan to use.\n\nThe website adds: \"The cooperation of supporters in this matter would be greatly appreciated as we seek to ensure that these revised arrangements operate in a safe and effective manner.\"\n\nLinfield and Cliftonville supporters have applauded the normalisation of the travel arrangements.\n\n\"The clubs deserve praise for their hard work,\" said one Linfield supporter. \n\n\"It\u0027s good to see another step along the road back to making things normal again,\" said a Cliftonville fan.\n\nOn a supporters\u0027 forum, however, a number of Linfield fans said they would not be going to the game because of the Cliftonville protest at the playing of God Save The Queen before their Irish Cup Final against Coleraine at Windsor Park in May.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ian paisley could be the first mp to lose his seat after recall petition","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

legislation, a recall petition is opened if an MP receives a prison sentence for an offence, is suspended from the Commons for 10 sitting days, or convicted of making a false allowance claim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstituents can force a by-election in cases of serious misconduct (PA)\n\n\n\n\nThe petition remains open for six weeks and if at the end of that period it has been signed by at least 10% of the electorate in the constituency, the MP loses their seat and a by-election is triggered.\n\nThe recalled MP can stand again as a candidate – as Mr Paisley has said he will do if he is recalled.\n\nOnce the petition is open, individuals and and organisations can campaign for or against it.\n\nSpending during the petition period is limited to £500 for non-registered campaigners and £10,000 for registered campaigners, including political parties.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

But it is a crying shame for youngsters in Omagh.\"\n\nLocal journalist Paddy Hunter shared pictures of the demolition on social media this week, prompting many ex-players to voice their dismay.\n\n\"The bigger picture is the fact the grounds were left to wrack and ruin after 2005,\" he said.\n\n\"There were more junior teams who enquired about using it, like Dunbreen Rovers and Strathroy Harps, who maybe had some ambition to go higher.\n\n\"There\u0027s a possibility if they got it they could have progressed to intermediate football.\n\n\"Omagh United came along a few years after Omagh Town finished. They played in Mid-Ulster league football and they got promotion to the top tier of it with a thought of moving on. \n\n\"I think not getting the use of St Julian\u0027s Road hamstrung them.\n\n\"The argument the council always had was that it wasn\u0027t safe and would cost too much to develop.\n\n\"I talked to a few local groundsmen, though, and their opinion was that a month or two of work would have had the playing surface back in good condition.\"\n\nOmagh Town leased the site, a former rubbish tip, from Omagh District Council in 1987.\n\nIn 1999 the stadium hosted three sell-out matches to raise money for the Omagh bomb appeal, hosting the Old Trafford, Anfield and Stamford Bridge giants.\n\nAn all-star United team won their match 9-0, with Teddy Sheringham scoring four.\n\nIn 2005 a 1-0 defeat to Institute saw Omagh Town relegated from top flight football, and the club folded shortly afterwards due to financial difficulties.\n\nMore than a decade later, in 2016, many local supporters were shocked by pictures showing just how dilapidated the grounds had become.\n\nWith the pitch and stands badly overgrown with weeds and shrubbery, the same spot once occupied by dedicated fans and footballers was now overrun by wildlife.\n\nMr Hunter said it was a lost opportunity that there was no longer a football ground in the area capable of hosting big games.\n\n\"I feel there\u0027s been no foresight here whatsoever,\" he added.\n\n\"In 2005 there was grant aid available for projects like this. \n\n\"So I feel like it\u0027s a shame that no one tried to save the grounds, and I think that will come back to bite them in years to come.\n\n\"There\u0027s so many junior football clubs in Omagh looking for pitches, so that\u0027s why this is such a shame.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37173767.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/E%20310718KB4%20%200003.jpg","title":"pride 2018 belfast out on the roof summer","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein confident it can force ian paisley to resign","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Voters are also able to cast their vote by post or proxy.\n\nMr McGuigan said: \"I believe the Electoral Office could and should have done more to assist people to engage with the petition, for instance by opening more locations for longer hours. \n\n\"However, in the absence of that, Sinn Fein will certainly do as much as we possibly can to assist and encourage people to exercise their right to have their say in this process.\"\n\nUUP leader Robin Swann also described the opening of just three locations as \"totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim\".\n\nMr Swann, a North Antrim MLA, expressed concern about the \"restricted opening times of 9am-5pm\" on weekdays. The UUP won\u0027t register to campaign for Mr Paisley\u0027s removal but its leader has said he will sign the petition and will encourage anyone who believes what the DUP MP did was wrong to do likewise.\n\nThe Electoral Office has defended the arrangements it has made.\n\nMr Paisley has been suspended by Westminster for 30 days for failing to declare the two luxury holidays valued at up to £100,000.\n\nHe has also been suspended from the DUP pending investigation by party officers.\n\nCauseway Coast and Glens DUP councillor John Finlay is organising a rally in support of Mr Paisley to be staged next Monday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn feins mcdonald laughs off dup claim her strings pulled by ira in belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Less than 24 hours later, she said she wanted a referendum as soon as possible.\n\nMr Hamilton said he had agreed with her initial position \"before Northern Command got the hold of you\" and changed it. There were shouts of \"wise up\" from the audience. \n\nMs McDonald rejected the suggestion that she was \"controlled by persons unnamed... apparently in west Belfast\" and joked that she wanted to meet the people Mr Hamilton was alluding to: \"Where are you, hardmen?\"\n\nShe said that she faced claims of being an \"ultra\", as well as criticism of her use of the word \u0027Londonderry\u0027 and commented: \"I can\u0027t be all of these things.\" \n\nUUP leader Robin Swann, Fine Gael Health Minister Simon Harris, Fianna Fail TD and Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry took part in the debate in St Mary\u0027s College.\n\nMr Hamilton joked that he was delighted to be there representing the DUP, \"the second biggest party in west Belfast\". \n\nTo combined laughter and boos from the floor, he said that Arlene Foster sent her best to everyone and was sorry she couldn\u0027t make it as she was guaranteed such a good reception.\n\nOn a border poll, Ms McDonald said \"constitutional change is in the air\" and \"the clock is counting down to the referendum on unity\". She welcomed comments from former DUP leader Peter Robinson on the need for unionists to prepare for a border poll, adding \"political unionism can no longer bury its head in the sand\".\n\nThe Sinn Fein president rejected claims from Mr Swann and Mr Hamilton that there was no need for a border poll and it would lead to more instability and divisions. She challenged the \"fairytale\" that \"the North was a perfect place and then comes along talk of a border poll that creates entrenchment\".\n\nMs McDonald said Sinn Fein would oppose any attempt to change the rules on a referendum to mean 50% plus one wasn\u0027t enough for Irish unity. \"What\u0027s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Partition is maintained on 50% plus one,\" she said.\n\nMr Hamilton said unionists had believed Ms McDonald would represent a new era in Sinn Fein, and while he acknowledged there had been glimpses of that, she still had \"some work to do\".\n\nHe stated that Sinn Fein didn\u0027t show respect for the British identity in Northern Ireland particularly in the \"west of the province (on) Union flags and Orange parades\".\n\nMr Swann challenged Ms McDonald over using the slogan \u0027Tiocfaidh ar la\u0027 in her first speech after becoming Sinn Fein leader. \"As a unionist, that is not a welcome in any shape or form,\" he said. \n\nThe Sinn Fein president said as a republican those words were \"our vernacular\" and didn\u0027t \"carry menace\". She challenged the DUP on its opposition to an Irish Language Act and same-sex marriage. To loud applause, she said \"50,000 walked in Pride - that\u0027s the big parading season now\". The DUP must recognise \"this is 2018, not the 1600s\".\n\nMr Hamilton accused Sinn Fein of blocking the return of power-sharing. He said he believed it would be restored but didn\u0027t know when. \n\nTo demands for \"equality\" from the floor, he said his party wouldn\u0027t return to Stormont on the basis of a \"rollover to Sinn Fein\". Any deal had to be \"fair and balanced\". \n\n\"Was RHI fair and balanced?\" an audience member shouted. \"You had an agreement and you ran away,\" somebody else said.\n\nMr Eastwood said nationalists were \"once again a restless people\", but said Sinn Fein was too contaminated by the past to lead a border poll campaign.\n\nMs Chambers called on local politicians to push \"the pause button\" on their arguments and get Stormont up and running to deal with the Brexit crisis. She declined to say when her party would stand in elections here.\n\nMr Harris expressed support for same-sex marriage and said love wasn\u0027t a unionist-nationalist issue.\n\nMr Farry said unionists needed to wake up to the reality that young people were increasingly looking to Irish unity as a route to addressing equality issues. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"time drawing near for ireland border poll sinn feins mcdonald tells hunger strike event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The march in Castlewellan was attended by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald.It marks the anniversary of the deaths of 10 republican hunger strikers, including Bobby Sands and Raymond McCreesh in 1981.In previous years tens of thousands of republicans have attended the event, which changes location annually.Relatives of IRA victims have accused Sinn Fein of \"insulting\" their loved ones memories, saying the commemoration compounds their grief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter, she continued, had a responsibility to take a lead on the process.\n\n\"Political leaders must begin practical preparations for a new, inclusive Ireland beyond partition,\" she added.\n\n\"We are entering a defining period in Irish political history.\n\n\"Change is coming and it must be managed, sensitively and imaginatively.\n\n\"A process of national reconciliation must be central to any genuine effort to unite the people of this island.\"\n\nAddressing the ongoing Brexit fallout, Ms McDonald said Remainers within the unionist community would be increasingly attracted to being part of a \"new and outward-looking Ireland\" as the UK continues to \"turn away from Europe\".\n\nShe also reiterated Sinn Fein\u0027s commitment to forging a united Ireland that would accommodate unionists and their culture.\n\n\"British identity can and must be accommodated in a united Ireland and I believe nationalist Ireland is open to constitutional and political safeguards to ensure this,\" insisted the party leader.\n\n\"The right of unionists to celebrate their history and tradition, to recount their experiences and suffering, and to remember and honour their dead must be, and will be, respected.\"\n\nAnd to claps and cheers, she added: \"Just as our right to remember, to commemorate and honour our dead will be respected.\"\n\nMs McDonald also stressed that the party would continue to build on its equality agenda in the event of Irish unity as she laid out Sinn Fein\u0027s vision.\n\n\"It will be an Ireland united and at peace with itself. It will be a successful, prosperous Ireland of opportunity for all, regardless of class, colour, religion, gender or sexual orientation,\" she told the crowd.\n\nReasserting her party\u0027s commitment to seeing the Executive and Assembly restored, Ms McDonald said the political stalemate could only be overcome if progress is made on a number of social issues, such as the extension of same-sex marriage legislation to the North, which the DUP is strongly against.\n\n\"Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Fifty years on from the civil rights movement, sections of political unionism still resist equality and rights, but they will not succeed.\n\n\"It is not sufficient for the two Governments to only call a talks process. They must bring something to the table. They need to make clear that agreements must be implemented in full.\"\n\nMs McDonald added that the DUP\u0027s \u0027confidence and supply\u0027 agreement with the Tories continued to be a sticking point in getting the Assembly\u0027s institutions restored.\n\n\"We are dealing with a British Government that is dependent on DUP votes and sees Ireland as collateral damage in their desire to remain in office,\" she added. \"That is why we need a strong Irish Government leading on these issues.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"gerry adams to publish negotiations cook book","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It will measure 8,000km long (4,970 miles) and 15km wide (nine miles).\n\nThe UN’s proposal would also involve schools, parishes and community groups in planting trees in Ireland, increasing biodiversity and contributing to atmospheric improvement.\n\n\nThe SMA ‘Laudato Tree Project’ inaugurated by the President of Ireland \nhttps://t.co/U2BOinbgEQ\n \npic.twitter/Z3xj8rqxDE\n\n— SMAIreland (@SMAIreland) \nApril 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe project takes its name from a 2015 papal encyclical by Pope Francis, Laudato Si’, on caring for the environment, and is intended to be a visible expression of the encyclical’s intervention.\n\nThe Pontiff is visiting Ireland this summer as part of the World Meeting of Families in Dublin.\n\nMr Mullan said: “We are asking for a donation of 60 euros [the equivalent of five euros per month], but will be happy to accept less or more, based on what people can afford.\n\n“Working in association with the SMA, the Tree Council of Ireland and the UNCCD, the project will transform donations into the planting of six trees in total: one tree in Ireland and five trees along the Great Green Wall.\n\n“This also includes the after care of the trees and the training of Great Green Wall  communities who will plant and take care of the trees for future generations.”\n\nEach donation will be used to plant a tree in a woodland in Ireland and to plant five trees on Africa’s Great Green Wall, running through northern Ghana and Burkina Faso.\n\nSome will be invested in Ireland, promoting climate justice, the planting of trees (including 10 years aftercare), and increasing Ireland’s biodiversity.\n\nIreland’s tree coverage is currently the lowest in Europe at 11%. The average tree coverage throughout the European Union is 37%\n\nAnother part of the donation will go towards restoring degraded lands along the Sahel, training Great Green Wall communities, increasing food security, creating green jobs and reducing the need for migration or the dangers of radicalisation, Mr Mullan added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26.

Whilst this has now subsided, we are continuing to closely monitor the situation to determine what further action may be required.\n\n“Balfour Beatty will ensure the Anchorsholme flood defences remain fully safe and secure at all times.\n\n“Any required remedial works will be undertaken at no additional cost to the taxpayer.”\n\n\n\nWhatever has led to this damage, the people of Blackpool should not be left at increased risk or out of pocket as a result.\nPaul Maynard MP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackpool North and Cleveleys MP Paul Maynard said he would be calling on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to independently investigate after continuing problems were reported.\n\nHe said: “Significant amounts of public money went into this scheme and I am worried it appears to deteriorating so soon after work was completed.\n\n“It is important to establish what has gone wrong and for any remedial action to be completed as soon as possible.\n\n“The most important thing is to ensure homes and businesses continue to be protected from flooding and with the autumn approaching this is clearly a matter of urgency.\n\n“Whatever has led to this damage, the people of Blackpool should not be left at increased risk or out of pocket as a result.”\n\nBlackpool Council’s cabinet member for environmental services and highways Fred Jackson said meetings were being held with Balfour Beatty to agree upon the repair works programme.\n\nHe said: “Balfour Beatty is our appointed contractor for design and build and any repair solutions, work and related costs remain their responsibility. This includes the costs of repairing any defects.\n\n“With any project of this size there can be additional work required to rectify any issues. The council is aware that surveys have been carried out that help inform appropriate repair solutions.”\n\nHe added: “Despite the work that may be required it is important that we must not lose sight of the huge benefits that the sea wall is providing.\n\n“This significant project is reducing the flood risk to 4,800 properties and businesses in Blackpool. It also safeguards the tramway, road and major pumping station infrastructure on the northern seafront. The long-term benefits accruing from this cannot be underestimated when looking at the project overall.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch rare footage shows titanic waterspout off the coast of italy","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Which players should entrants to this league of opposites be looking to select this year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Adam Davy/PA)\n\n\n\n\n“I was early enough to select Daley Blind and give him the captain’s armband, which ought to serve me well seeing as he plays for Ajax now,” said Tom.\n\n“In terms of high-priced gambles, it might be tempting to back Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez to each lose a bit of their magic without the other one in support.”\n\nBut beware filling your squad with want-away players, especially if there’s a chance they could move to a Premier League rival and thrive.\n\n“The worst thing to do is grab a want-away or out-of-favour player like Anthony Martial, only to then see him move to another Premier League team and rack up points,” said Tom.\n\nThink your team is rubbish enough? It’s time to find out.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pictured us baseball streaker from northern ireland reports","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

This permission lapsed on the in November 2012.\n\nLast Thursday night, the Glen Development Initiative (GDI) issued a statement on their Facebook page and issued letters around the Glen area calling for people to join them in protest outside the offices of Mark H Durkan MLA.\n\nThey claimed that the decision was made ‘due to an act known as the Reservoir Act’. GDI said that ‘It means that in the event of the reservoir walls collapsing and all the water escaping the new builds would be in danger.\n\n‘We must also make clear that the area IS NOT a flood plain and this was clarified at the planning meeting.\n\n‘We would therefore call upon you to join us tomorrow to show our disappointment at the SDLP office on Strand Road (Long’s Supermarket) at 11.30am.’\n\nMr Durkan responded on Facebook by saying he was ‘shocked and saddened to learn that a \u0027politically neutral\u0027 community group, managed by a former SF Councillor’ were ‘planning to stage a protest outside my office...over a decision taken by Derry City and Strabane District Council.’\n\nHe added that he had advised constituents who had appointments during this time that they would be postponed but added that he was ‘looking forward to the engagement’ with GDI.\n\nMembers of the GDI arrived outside the office and were met by Mr Durkan and party colleague, Tina Gardiner, who sits on the planning committee and voted against the Glen Development.\nGerry MacLochlainn of GDI presented Mr Durkan and Ms Gardiner with letters of objection to the decision.\n\nDuring sometimes fraught exchanges that lasted almost a half an hour, Mr Durkan questioned why the group had chosen to protest outside his office and asked if they were going to protest outside council offices and DUP offices or protest against the independent councillor who voted according to the planning experts’ recommendations.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027241156\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nMr MacLochlainn said they were going to protest at these places, however, Mr Durkan said this information was not shared in their message on Facebook or in the letter delivered around the Glen and he accused some members of GDI of being ‘politically motivated’.\n\nAt this point, some protesters presents said they had no political interest but simply an interest in the betterment of their community.\n\n\n‘Anger and frustration’\n\n\nSpeaking after the protest ended, Mr MacLochlainn said: “The SDLP are accusing us of a political stunt, the people in general aren’t. \n\n“Certainly, the feeling that we’re getting on the doorsteps was extreme anger at the decision to stop housing being built in this area and I think the people who decided to do that would need to answer questions. They can twist this whatever way they like but the minutes of the meeting will be clear.\n“Planning had to intervene and tell Councillor Gardiner that she was wrong, she had it wrong – there was no danger of that type of flooding at all. This is purely about a worst case scenario of a total and utter collapse of the reservoir. The Head of the Rivers Agency and the Chair of Civil Engineers of Northern Ireland were publicly on the record as saying that type of assessment was extremely unlikely, in fact, he said ‘hugely unrealistic’.\n\n“It was not decided on the basis of people being flooded in Ivy Mead or on the basis of people being flooded out of their houses because the type of risk assessment that the Minister thought was ok for there was the type of risk assessment that Cllr Gardiner insisted shouldn’t be used when it came to looking at the reservoir.”\n\nHe added said that, although he can’t speak on all of the councillors who voted, in relation to Cllr Gardiner he believed she voted against it on the grounds the site was a flood plain even though she was told it wasn’t, she persisted with that and repeated it on Radio Foyle the next day.\nMaurice Bowe, Director at GDI, added that the guidance the councillors voted on does ‘not permit standard risk assessment on the Reservoirs Act’.\n\nIn response, Cllr Gardiner said: “I want to reassure people that the proposal that I made was based on reading the application that was in front of us, looking at the expert advice, having no evidence to contradict that expert advice and I felt that I couldn’t make any other call.\n\n“Had there been different evidence there presented to us, we would’ve looked at it and weighed it up and possibly come up with a different decision but we were left with no choice because the only evidence that was there was a recommendation to refuse.”\n\nMr Durkan said he would stand over his comment that he believes the protest was ‘politically motivated’.\n\n“They said that they were going to other places to protest but clearly what they put on social media and leaflets delivered around the Glen area, here was where they wanted the protest.\n\n“I can understand anger and frustration at this decision and I share the frustration that we are going to have to wait even longer for homes to be built in the Glen.\n\n“There was originally an approval for social housing there nearly 10 years ago now that I worked on and that I welcomed and here we are 10 years later and not a sod has been turned and people are still waiting for houses.\n\n“We have countless people in here week in week out trying to get housing so I’m acutely aware of the shortage in Derry but the fact is, if this was an application for a private development, it would have been laughed out of the chamber. There would be no consideration whatsoever given the risk associated with that site.\n\n“Are they suggesting that people in social housing shouldn’t be afforded the same protection and the same standards – that’s absolutely preposterous.”\n\n\nPictured above: Gerry MacLochlainn of GDI speaks to Mark Durkan SDLP MLA and his party colleague, Cllr Tina Gardiner.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"nurse claims bed closures altnagelvin caused staff absences due stress","story":"\nA nurse working in Altnagelvin Hospital has claimed that there have been bed closures at the hospital due to nursing staff having to take time off work with stress-related conditions.\n\nThe Western Trust member of nursing staff, who did not wish to be named, claimed there were multiple bed closures on wards because of the lack of nursing staff, many on sick leave for stress-related matters.\n\n“We are under a lot of pressure and it’s inevitable that the cracks are going to show,” said the nurse.\n“The continual pressure we are under due to severe cuts to the NHS is having a detrimental effect on nursing staff. \n\n“We need to be able to be at our best to care for others but when we are so stressed that we can’t do our jobs properly, we don’t want to put our patients’ lives at risk.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027241128\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trust (Western Trust) said: “During the summer months, the number of beds that are available within the hospital fluctuates to cater for patient demand, and is influenced by a range of factors such as nurse staffing vacancies, sickness absence and annual leave provision for both permanent and agency staff.\n\n“The safety of our patients is a fundamental priority for the Trust.
