During her delivery she suffered several complications including blood clots in her lungs.At the conference Amal slammed President Donald Trump for mocking Christine Blasey Ford after she took a stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and detailed how Judge Brett Kavanaugh allegedly sexually assaulted her back in the summer of 1982. \u0027Survivors in any country deserve the chance to look their abusers in the eye and for history to record what has happened to them. That means the president of a country should not publicly ridicule a women who courageously comes forward to allege abuse,\u0027 she said to the conference attendees Friday morning.\u0027And it means the leader of the Senate should not assure constituents that he would plow right through her testimony,\u0027 she added. Tennis legend Serena Williams used her platform to critique how mothers are treated in today\u0027s healthcare system, reflecting on her own delivery of baby Alexis Olympia Ohanian in which she suffered several complications including blood clots in her lungs.\u0027In this country that\u0027s supposed to be so technology-advanced, why are we treating our mothers like this? I was really fortunate because I had an opportunity for my voice to be heard. I had a wonderful female doctor who listened to me. There are so many women who were not being listened to. It\u0027s really unacceptable,\u0027 the champion said.\u0027I always have these insecurities that I’m not good enough as a mom. We all go through these different emotions that people don’t really feel comfortable talking about. I think we should.

It was taken in 2013 during the Cannes film festival.Solarino appeared to be sending a message to her fellow countrymen and women over their lack of support for Argento.Solarino\u0027s caption, which was written in Italian, read: \u0027We have reversed the facts so as not to see them.\u0027Violence, stupidity, ignorance, the superficiality of comments that I read or listen to leave me speechless.\u0027Solarino then relayed a message from Argento which read: \u0027This middle finger is for those Italians - I repeat: Italians, who accuse me of having sought the violence suffered by a girl because I have not run away and because I have not reported before.\u0027It\u0027s the fault of people like you if women are afraid to tell the truth.\u0027From the rest of the world I receive only words of solidarity and comfort, in my country I am called a b****.

I am not afraid of what is coming. But the truth still remains You slept w Jimmy Bennett. You lied when You demand others accused of sexual assault to be honest. This hurts victims’ voices everywhere.\u0027The model is a new acquaintance of Argento, whom she met through McGowan.Dove started dating the actress earlier this year in the wake of McGowan\u0027s rage-filled rant at a transgender woman at a New York City book signing for her memoir Brave that many found to be transphobic.In the wake of that incident, Dove offered to help the actress repair her image.Dove said that she released the texts with McGowan\u0027s blessing, and also sent her exchanges with the actress to the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u0027s Department. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/12/16/0696B89A000003E8-6270147-When_Prince_Harry_and_Meghan_Markle_were_married_in_May_the_titl-m-89_1539358132880.jpg","title":"Princess Eugenie Jack Brooksbank WONT new titles","story":"Go for a fairytale dress like Princess Eugenie in Peter PilottoShop the brand at NET-A-PORTERIt\u0026#39s the second Royal wedding of the year, and the second time we\u0026#39ve fallen head over heels in love with a big white dress.

Obviously that was never going to work, so they got Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford to host it instead.I love Eamonn and Ruth, but I’m not sure if having the king and queen of daytime television commentating on your wedding is anything for a blood princess to boast about. On the snob-o-meter, it’s the equivalent of hoping for Edward and Wallis Simpson, but having to settle for Homer and Marge instead.Yet while Eamonn might not have the gravitas or presence of a vintage Dimbleby, he wasted no time in establishing hitherto unknown credentials as a millinery expert of rare refinement.‘Where’d she get those chopsticks that go through that hat?’ he wondered, when the Duchess of York first appeared in her leprechaun-themed finery.

In the end, the couple settled on a kind of relaxed but upbeat jocularity, and it was a privilege to share their big day. Eamonn and Ruth I mean, not Eugenie and Jack. Did I say relaxed? Eamonn had the air of a man upon whom forceps were recently used to extricate him from his favourite La-Z-Boy recliner, while his darling wife appeared to have been up all night cementing her hair with max strength lacquer to combat the 40mph winds swirling around their temporary studio in the Lower Ward of Windsor Castle.‘It’s a bad bride hair day,’ she said, as the most extraordinary ragbag of guests began staggering down the hill in their wedding-day best. ‘Oh, top of Kate Moss’s head there,’ said Eamonn, helpfully. ‘Holly Valance, very stylish,’ noted Ruth, as the actress wife of property tycoon Nick Candy tottered past in pink heels.

They were among the many millions who had lost a husband or a boyfriend in the carnage of World War ILooking back, Paddington was quite a lot like my father. Norman ‘Norrie’ Bond was the manager of the local post office, and he always wore a hat.On holiday at the Isle of Wight, he went into the sea with his trousers rolled up and kept his hat on, in case he met someone he knew. If he hadn’t been able to raise his hat, he would have been mortified.In my story, the Browns took Paddington to live with them at Number 32 Windsor Gardens. It seemed to me that any family who would take a strange bear home to live with them must be a pretty soft touch, so there was need for a stronger character in the background. Someone of whom Paddington would remain slightly in awe.Mrs Bird, the Browns’ housekeeper, was a familiar type of woman in Britain between the wars. They were among the many millions who had lost a husband or a boyfriend in the carnage of World War I and found themselves reduced to living with a relative in return for doing all the housework and the cooking. Mr Brown was also very like my father, who was hopelessly addicted to his pipe. He once almost choked after smoking a mothball that had rolled into the bowl while in his pocket.On another occasion, he started to light the gas fire but couldn’t find a live match, because of his tidy habit of placing the burnt ones back in the matchbox after getting his pipe going. By the time he located one, he’d forgotten the gas was on and lit his pipe instead.I don’t remember the explosion, because I was in my pram at the time — with the hood up, fortunately. That protected me when the kitchen dresser was blasted on top of me, shattering most of my parents’ wedding china.Many of my earliest memories sprang from my imagination. Each morning, after washing with a jug of cold water that drained into a bucket, I would use the toilet, pull the chain and run downstairs as fast as I could. I had to reach the bottom before the cistern stopped flushing, otherwise the world would come to an end. Small children’s minds are full of secret fears.          Paddington Bear is pictured in a later cartoon TV series as the brand took off. Bond said the bear reminded him of his father, Norman ‘Norrie’ Bond, who managed the local post office, and always wore a hatChildhood imagination came to the fore again after my wartime service, first in the RAF (I was airsick) and then in the Army. While waiting for demob in Egypt, I had submitted an article to a magazine, and received a cheque for my trouble. I decided I rather liked the idea of being a writer, and kept trying through the Fifties, while earning my living at the BBC as a trainee cameraman (among the shows I worked on were Dixon Of Dock Green and Blue Peter).My agent, Harvey Unna, was a sweet-natured Jewish man who had fled Germany in 1933 with the equivalent of just £5 in his pocket.He had suggested that I might do well with children’s stories, though I hadn’t had a lot of luck before Paddington.As I wrote the first story, with its refugee overtones, I remembered the story of Harvey’s flight to Britain, and this partly inspired my character Mr Gruber, the antiques dealer. Mr Gruber and Paddington become firm friends, perhaps because the old man understands what it is like to find oneself an immigrant in a strange country with no money and nowhere to go.Paddington and Mr Gruber enjoy a formal yet very special relationship, always addressing each other by their surnames. It wouldn’t occur to either of them that it could be any other way.Paddington’s hat and duffle coat were simply replicas of what I happened to be wearing. The basket on wheels, which became his trademark whenever he went out shopping, was an indispensable part of our own household equipment. And his love of marmalade came about just because I happen to prefer it to honey.After eight days of writing, I had a first draft ready for Harvey Unna. He wrote back to say he liked it, but picked me up on an error: I’d said Paddington came from Darkest Africa. ‘There are no bears in Africa, darkest or otherwise,’ Harvey reproved me. ‘Children either know this or should know this, and I suggest you make suitable amends.’A trip to Westminster Public Library, followed by a visit to Regent’s Park Zoo, solved the problem. I settled on Darkest Peru. And on February 10, 1958, Harvey wrote again to say A Bear Called Paddington had been accepted by Collins, the publishers, who were offering an advance of £75.They suggested Peggy Fortnum as the illustrator. It isn’t easy to capture a young bear’s likeness in a few lines, but Peggy did it to perfection with her pen-and-ink drawings. With a few deft strokes she captured his eyes, his shagginess, his lightly hunched figure, his purposeful air.By Christmas, the entire first print-run had sold out and my publisher wondered whether I would write a sequel. As Paddington would say, I needed no second bidding.          An earlier photo of Michael Bond with a toy bear. After eight days of writing the first draft, Bond visited Regent\u0027s Park Zoo, and decided the bear\u0027s fictional origins were Darkest PeruWith success came book signing tours. These were not without their hazards. Marmalade sandwiches figure large in any kind of Paddington promotion and there were times when I wished I had given him a liking for something a little more exotic, like truffles or out-of-season asparagus. It was too late.At one school summer fete, a squad of sixth-formers were seen disappearing fast over the brow of a hill, carrying a large trunkful of marmalade sandwiches and pursued by a swarm of wasps.At another event in Glasgow, expecting a modest turnout, my publishers advertised free marmalade sandwiches. Children and sundry passers-by turned out in droves. Soon the police were called to control the crowds outside.By the time I arrived, the supply of sandwiches was exhausted and, to make matters worse, I discovered the children’s books department was on the top floor.Forcing my way up a narrow, winding staircase, I squeezed past a hungry, disgruntled horde who held me personally responsible for the absence of bread-and-marmalade. There were other perils. One Christmas, I was invited to switch on the lights in a Devon town and, as often happens, someone had dressed up as Paddington to stand beside me on the balcony. During the photocall, a local journalist asked if I would mind having the bear sit on my lap for a picture.Once Paddington had made himself comfortable I gave him a big hug while bouncing him up and down for the camera. During the inevitable argument about whether the flash was working, I asked the bear: ‘And how old are you?’To my alarm, a girl’s voice said, ‘Seventeen.’ Immediately I saw banner headlines: ‘Children’s author molests girl, 17! I thought it was a bear, pleads middle-aged writer.’          The Paddington film was released in 2014, featuring a CGI computer generated bear, above, which was an instant hit. Bond said he was \u0027totally amazed\u0027 at the animation. The first producer who tried to make a Paddington film insisted on having a real actor, which caused problemsThe first producer to try to put Paddington on film was convinced that it would work only with a real actor dressed up in furs. Communication with the actor in the suit was impossible. He couldn’t hear what was being said to him, let alone see where he was going. He could raise his hat, but he could never manage to put it back on his head.Bereft of facial expressions, he tended to resort to falling over backwards with his legs in the air whenever he needed to register even mild surprise. If anything more startling was needed, he began running around in circles.The props department created a head for Paddington with eyes that actually blinked. Unfortunately, they did it randomly and not both at the same time, so that the bear looked like it had a particularly nasty tic that caused it to wink at passers-by on both sides.The producer’s constant search for financial backing led to some tiresome meetings with moguls chomping cigars in backrooms and proposing extraordinary changes to my stories.On one memorable occasion, in the space of about a quarter of an hour, Mr Gruber’s antique shop turned into an emporium selling old Army uniforms (the designer just happened to have a relative who owned such an establishment on the Portobello Road, available on favourable terms) and the Browns’ children, Jonathan and Judy, gained a few years in order to become teenagers with drugs problems (this idea came from the director, who was clearly speaking from first- hand experience).There were moments when it wouldn’t have surprised me if someone had got up and demanded to know what a bear was doing in the story. I sometimes wondered the same myself.When the Paddington musical opened in London at the Duke Of York’s Theatre in 1974, again the lead role was played by someone in a bear skin, this time with a mask.The actor came up with the idea of gluing a black ping-pong ball to his nose. It worked well enough until one night the glue dissolved. The sound of a ball bouncing over a stage, pursued by its owner, is distinctive and won a round of applause.Much noisier was the occasion when, in the opening scene at Paddington station, a luggage trolley (borrowed from British Rail — enormously heavy and with a mind of its own) took off on its own accord, gathering speed as it headed towards the footlights. As it disappeared into the orchestra pit, there was an enormous crash and everything went black.Another problem was Paddington’s voice. I imagined quite a bearish sound — the closest I ever heard in real life was on a beach one holiday, when an elderly German walked past talking to his wife in a high-pitched growl.

And it’s a long way too from the house in Reading where I spent the first nine years of my life.A few years ago, I returned at the request of a newspaper for a series it was running on childhood memories. The house felt warm and friendly, and the memories came flooding back. I found myself wishing my parents could have been there to see it all, and I could have thanked them for my childhood, which I never did. It is the kind of thing one always leaves until it’s too late.Most of all I could have thanked them for giving me a love of books, for it brought not only immeasurable pleasure but my livelihood too.But there is no going back. Besides, the bathroom has been modernised and I’m not sure I would trust the sleek new toilet to keep on flushing until I reached the bottom of the stairs — and who knows what might happen if I didn’t make it?Extracted from Bears \u0026amp Forebears: A Life So Far by Michael Bond, published by HarperCollins. © Michael Bond 1996. To order special anniversary editions of The Complete Adventures of Paddington (£40 offer price £32) and A Bear Called Paddington (£20 offer price £16), visit www.mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640. Offers valid to 201018."},{"url":null,"title":"May dump DUP force Brexit plans","story":"    Theresa May (pictured leaving Downing Street) could put an end to her alliance with the DUP and press ahead with her Brexit plans despite opposition from her Northern Irish allies\u0027You admit you have no evidence\u0027: British journalist...Why are \u0027patriotic\u0027 Brexiteers risking the break-up of the...Share this article    DUP leader Arlene Foster (pictured in Portadown yesterday) said the party would stand by its red line on the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK \u0027come what may\u0027Liam Fox, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Dominic Raab all voiced fears about the lack of a time limit on the UK\u0027s membership of the customs union.  Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said that a provision on customs which was not \u0027finite\u0027 would fail to deliver the result of the 2016 referendum.  One Cabinet source predicted the issue could lead to resignations in the coming days. They said: \u0027This is going to be a big test for some ministers.

An alarm sounded and Girl With Balloon began to self-destruct. There were gasps as the artwork started to shred itself. Some guests almost dropped their champagne glasses, and one well-groomed, bespectacled man could be seen putting his hand to his forehead in disbelief. They had just witnessed the most spectacular prank in art history.The escapade at Sotheby’s New Bond Street galleries on Friday last week came at the climax of the busiest week in the London art market, when international collectors fly in for the Frieze art fair. It made headlines around the world.Banksy later posted a video on Instagram claiming ‘responsibility’, showing Girl With Balloon being sliced into strips by blades he had secretly installed in the picture’s frame ‘a few years ago’, defending the stunt with a quote from Picasso: ‘The urge to destroy is also a creative urge.’Behind the quotation lay Banksy’s contempt for what he and others see as the rampant commercialism and misplaced values of the art world. Booby-trapping his own creation seconds after it sold for more than £1 million was the ultimate expression of that credo.Yet the added notoriety, some experts argue, could double the value of the vandalised Girl With Balloon and increase the value of all Banksy works, with opportunistic dealers reaping the commercial rewards. Will Banksy — who is widely acknowledged to be former public schoolboy Robin Gunningham, 45 — benefit financially?He says he gives much of the money he makes to charity. But the author of his unauthorised biography, The Man Behind The Wall, noted that he was ‘much richer than I imagined’.So might there be an element of hypocrisy in his latest stunt?The buyer, Sotheby’s has revealed, is a female European collector and long-standing Sotheby’s client, who has decided to go through with the purchase for the same price achieved at auction.The news was released in a statement from Sotheby’s on Thursday night, after a slick PR operation.‘Banksy didn’t destroy an artwork in the auction, he created one,’ declared Alex Branczik, the auction house’s head of contemporary art in Europe. ‘Following his surprise intervention on the night, we are pleased to confirm the sale of the artist’s newly titled Love Is In The Bin, the first artwork in history to have been created live during an auction.’The collaboration between the world’s most admired ‘guerrilla’ artist and an institution that caters, in Banksy’s own words, to ‘the ‘overprivileged, the pretentious and the weak’ will be seen by some as a betrayal of his anti-Establishment credentials. But how far did it go?Sotheby’s insists it had ‘no prior knowledge’ of the stunt and was ‘not in any way involved’.There were rumours that — rather like Alfred Hitchcock, who made fleeting appearances in his own films — Banksy was in the saleroom on the night in question.The grand finale was certainly worthy of a Hitchcock plot and, a week on, continues to fascinate.Suspicious observers have pointed out that the frame of Girl With Balloon was so heavy it had to be hung on a load-bearing strip.

Esi Edugyan, Rachel Kushner, Daisy Johnson, Robin Robertson, Richard Powers and Anna Burns on the real stories behind their novelsWashington BlackMy book is about an 11- or 12-year-old field slave, Washington, on a Barbados plantation, who finds himself taken to live in the quarters of his master’s newly arrived brother, Christopher Wilde (or Titch). The prospect is terrifying. Every interaction with a white man has only begotten cruelty he is convinced it is a death sentence. But Titch is a gentleman scientist, and most importantly, an abolitionist. It is through this reprieve from field life that Washington begins to see himself as a fully realised human being, one with his own gifts to offer the world.The novel has its origins in the case of the Tichborne Claimant. A decade ago, I read a story by Jorge Luis Borges in which he touches very lightly on the case. At the time, I’d believed he had made up every outlandish detail. How surprised I was, then, to walk though the National Portrait Gallery in London years later and see depictions of all the flesh-and-blood people involved.Something of a cause celebre in Victorian England, pitting the working class against the gentry, the Claimant case centred around Roger Tichborne, a 25-year-old aristocrat who was shipwrecked and presumed dead. His mother, Lady Tichborne, consulted a clairvoyant who assured her that Roger was living under an assumed name in a far-off part of the world. She put advertisements in newspapers, and some years later made contact with a man in Australia who was claiming to be her son. She was fully convinced, but wanted someone who had known Roger in his youth to make the final identification. By chance, Andrew Bogle, one of her old servants, had retired to Sydney and would eventually act as the main witness for the defence when the question of the claimant’s identity went to trial.In Elizabethan England, “Bogle” meant phantom. This seems fitting for a man whose place in history remains so ghostly, so illegible. What we know of his early years can be reduced to his status as a slave: he was born on Hope plantation in St Andrew, Jamaica, property of the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. Bogle was secretly stolen away by Sir Edward Tichborne, who had come to do some brief work at the estate and for unknown reasons decided to leave with him. From there on, what we know of Bogle’s life is minimal: he travelled all around Europe as Sir Edward’s valet he became a devout Roman Catholic he married an Englishwoman called Elizabeth Young, and when she died, married again. The breadth of his legacy, then, is defined entirely by his entanglements with the Tichborne clan. He remains nearly forgotten, his inner life wholly unknown.It was that inner life that most interested me. In beginning Washington Black, I set out to write a novel that depicted the case through the lens of Bogle. But almost from the outset, the story began to drift and stray, evolving so far from Tichborne that only the barest of details remain: Roger’s family background and nickname Bogle’s origin story. Less than the trial’s machinations, I found myself interested in the psychology and voice of a figure like Bogle, who had been plucked from the brutal circumstances of one existence and taken to places that were drastically different from all that he had known. What complications would such a life hold?The character of Titch also interested me – a liberal, high-minded idealist who does so much in the service of those ideals but then ends up, quite unthinkingly, betraying them. It seemed a sad eventuality in a society so rigorously defined by inequality and cruelty. In this world, every good act has a dark underpinning.The novel came to be about many things. What stood at the forefront for me was its exploration of freedom: what constitutes true freedom, what is within our power to grant ourselves and others, and what its value is. Washington’s first understanding of what it means to be free is granted to him by Big Kit, his first protector and friend, who teaches him that in slavery only death is freedom. When her plans go awry, she gives Washington a somewhat less brutal idea: freedom, she says, is the choice to eschew work, to remain silent, and above all, to be orced from human entanglements. And it is this more basic idea of freedom that he carries out into the world and finds wanting, as he struggles to get his foothold in societies where he can only remain a stranger. Beyond the unchained body are liberties much more difficult to grasp and to hold. Free will, personal dignity, the sense of having some power over one’s life – these needs are as urgent as love, and too often, just as elusive.The Mars RoomHere’s a line I toyed with when I was just starting to think about this novel that became The Mars Room: “I took a Luger into Peter Luger’s.”I heard it in answer to the question: “What got you arrested?”Peter Luger’s is a fancy ye olde style steakhouse in Brooklyn. A luger is obviously ... a luger. Why did I like this line? It’s funny. And sadly very American, even if the luger is a German pistol. The line got at something I’ve witnessed among people who’ve been cuffed, busted, convicted, and thrown together in a jail or sheriff’s bus or prison. People talk up a big game. In that context, fiction is better understood than it is by fiction writers. People know to exaggerate. Their exaggerations are a kind of truth, the “virtuoso-true”, as a friend of mine puts it, lying only in order to tell you, accurately, just what kind of motherfucker you are dealing with.I had a friend in high school who would be face down on the ground, hands behind his back, and he’d insult the cop with a boot in his neck. He didn’t care. To win in that situation you have to be willing to lose everything. This same friend once escaped from jail. When he was caught, a paramilitary Swat team surrounded him on another friend’s roof. These ninja Swat turtles were screaming commands, in full gear, weapons raised. My friend was going to prison, no question. Later, prison killed him. But in that moment, on the roof, in front of his buddies, he took a drag of his cigarette, and said: “Man, you guys watch way too much TV.”None of this is in my novel. It’s background. Tone. Personal. And also: artistic imperative. If I didn’t make my novel funny, I would have failed to make it true. I didn’t need the luger gag. But my character Conan, who is the secret heart of the novel, would make such a claim if he could get away with it.After I wrote the novel, although I felt I succeeded in cracking into the humour of my invented world, a world meant to harbour the dirty and beautiful secrets of the real one, something more significant was at stake, and had been all along. The novel is not polemical I’m a broken record on this. And it shouldn’t be wedged into the entertainment column, either. How do people not understand this? The novelist is not competing with TV, for instance. The novel aims to be a work of art. It doesn’t aim to have a purpose, whether it’s to comfort, enrage, or “inform” its reader. Art is much more mysterious. What did Kant say? Purposive without purpose. What did Nietzsche say? Beyond good and evil, baby. Minus the baby. Here is what I say: art must be made with a pure intent, and a commitment to genuine risk. The thing created must be smarter than the person who made it. My book is smarter than I am about one particular thing, which I didn’t understand until after I made it, and that one thing is this: there are many who acknowledge that those who’ve gone to prison have been born without luck, and that bad luck can shape a person, unfairly. That is not so difficult.But few are willing to see the reverse of it, that the lucky, too, are shaped by their luck. It is deeply tempting to count oneself among the good. To see goodness as goodness, and not as luck. But that is an illusion. In a modern, stratified, bourgeois society, life mostly goes how it goes due to circumstance. You aren’t good. You’re lucky. Which isn’t to say that you’re bad. But your life could have gone wildly different.This is a confrontational truth that some might arrive at after reading my book, even as I did not drive toward, or intend for, the book to have that effect. And yet, I’m OK with it.The OverstoryI took a job as a professor in the English department at Stanford University, in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley. It’s an intense place with an insane amount of money flowing through it: the global HQs for Google, Apple, Intel, HP, eBay, Facebook, Netflix, Yahoo, Tesla and all kinds of other world-changing companies. The feel of the Valley is a little like science fiction at its most utopian.Just to the west run the Santa Cruz mountains, full of regrowing redwood forests that were cut down to build and rebuild San Francisco. I loved to hike up and disappear into this ghostly remnant of America’s past, whenever the future became a little more than I could bear.Walking underneath the Santa Cruz regrowth, intoxicated by the look and smells of those cloister-like forests I forgot that the enormous creatures above me were mostly youngsters. One day, I came across a truly old one which, for whatever accidents of history, had never been cut. It was like seeing a blue whale swimming among a pod of dolphins. I had trouble believing what I was looking at: a single living thing wider than a house, taller than a football pitch is long, and almost as old as Christianity.I began to realise what these forests must have been like before they were cut. A tremendous reservoir of natural capital – engines of creation and endless ersity –had been sacrificed in the building of what would become San Francisco, and by extension, Stanford and Silicon Valley. Though some part of a forest had grown back, something much larger, richer and more complex had been lost. My novel came together quickly after that, as if the pieces had all been there for a long time, waiting to be assembled into a narrative whole. The human characters were composites of people I’ve known and people I’d read about: nine protagonists who, for various reasons, achieve tree consciousness or have it thrust upon them. They each get caught up in the war between humans and non-humans, the struggle for destiny that we mistakenly believe was decided a long time ago. Once you begin to see trees, they start to reveal themselves as creatures with agency and intention, with intricate behaviour and intrinsic meaning. Recent research over the last several decades has discovered that trees are in fact immensely social beings, communicating with each other both over the air and through underground fungal networks. And we humans have always been part of those networks, changed by, changing, and dependent on them. We’ve become what we are by virtue of what trees have allowed us to be.My goal in The Overstory was to treat trees as people, to let them become central characters in a story much larger and older than the ones we usually tell about ourselves. We humans have this idea that we are exceptional, the only interesting and essential actors worth paying attention to, and that all other living things are incidental resources, here for our dominion. The truth is, we’re all in this business of life together. It’s time to get to know the neighbours and to come back home.MilkmanSomeone said to me recently: “I’m not going to ask you what your book’s about. I want you to tell me what you intended your book to do.” He stressed that end bit and I thought, what a question from this person I’ve only just been introduced to at this party. I answered: “I can’t say anything more about my book. I’m talked out. My brain has pulled over the curtains.” Although true, this was also code for, “Please don’t. I need a rest. Stop.”Later, with no stopwatch ticking down the seconds to hurry me into a soundbite answer, I thought about his question. It had seemed strange, unanticipated. The ones I had been getting about Milkman, and so have started more and more to expect, are: “Why have you not put names?” “Why pages of paragraphs?” “Is this really you in the book?” “Why Ireland again when you could be getting on with your life?” “About this language you use in the book …” I can see – now that my brain has opened the curtains again – that the man’s question was the same as: “What started you writing your book?” The only answer I can give is that I started writing it because it wanted to come.I don’t mean this as a brush-off. I mean, this is how I write. The smallest intention I could say I did have initially for Milkman, and one that fell away immediately on my attempting to put it into action, was that I thought to take a few hundred words that were superfluous in a novel I was currently writing, and see if I could write up a short story from them. Instead, they turned into Milkman. The point is, I can’t intend anything in my writing, or demand anything of my writing. I have no idea what is going to come.Except the characters. They come. Usually. Unless I’m being seriously desperate and grabby and controlling and fearful and in a hurry and showing it. They don’t like that. I don’t blame them. Also, they would be astonished, then amused, if they thought they were to show only for me to give them instructions. My characters tell me who they are – and what it is they want me to do. I’m allowed to enthusiastically second-guess, they don’t mind that, which is nice of them. They let me have this fantasy, and they don’t frown on my audacity or mock or hinder me or push on my insecurity complexes. However, they also pay no attention to me.When it comes to the end, to wrap up time, I realise once again that my characters have ignored all my clever guesswork and my insightful assumptions as to the progression of our novel. They’ll have deleted bits of writing that they allowed me for the duration but to which they never had any intention of giving the confirmatory thumbs up. Into the bin these writings go. Or I’ll awake in the morning and they’ll have dashed out of the computer on to the living room floor all my latest squashed-in bits of great ideas and precious writing. Ruthlessly, it is they who kill my darlings, then shrug and suggest I get over it. You need a strong constitution in my position, also a certain amount of forgiving forbearance, in order to deal with the desire, also the dread, of working with that lot.The Long TakeAfter nine books, including five poetry collections and a Selected Poems, I felt I’d reached a crossroads. Having enjoyed writing an extended historical sequence, and invented Scots folk narratives, I decided on a bigger canvas: one that would allow me to address subjects that seemed beyond the dense cat’s cradle of the lyric poem. I’ve lived in London most of my life, but I’ve almost never written about cities. I was interested in recalling my own ambivalence when I first came down from my small world in north-east Scotland to become another outsider in the metropolis. The contradictions were immediately evident: the city as escape – excitement, anonymity, endless possibilities. And the city as trauma: sensory overload, poverty, squalor and crime.I spent many hours watching film noir. In late-70s London, the unusual atmosphere of those movies made perfect sense: here was my disorientation and desire, my dread. Even though I came from the same landmass, and had the same language, I was now an alien. These movies were made by extreme outsiders: émigré directors and cinematographers who fled Nazi Germany for Hollywood. Theirs was a style, a way of seeing, that had clear sociopolitical origins and could be characterised – as one character remarks in my book – as “German Expressionism meets the American Dream”.Once I knew I was writing about cities, I knew they had to be the cities of America, and the book should be set in the decade after the second world war, which seems to me to be a pivotal period.The dream had faltered during the Depression, and again through the forced entry into the conflict after Pearl Harbor. The US was traumatised and exposed, paranoid about communism and the nuclear threat, and riddled with corruption, organised crime and social and racial ision. Its sympathy for the “huddled masses” who had built the country was now being overtaken by its fear and distrust of “the outsider”. America was 170 years old at the end of that war, and it was already failing. Here begins – as I see it – a narrative line that goes, in 60 years, from the McCarthy witch-hunts to the cold war and Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and the current regime.Into this postwar decade I dropped Walker, a former soldier from Nova Scotia, ravaged by PTSD and scarred by what he’s seen and done in the war. He’s looking for everything he’s lost – decency, love, a community – but Walker finds only brittle illusions, transience and isolation. It’s when he gets to the streets of Los Angeles – a city in constant flux, being endlessly demolished and rebuilt (“like a speeded-up war”) – that he finds a kind of home: a way back into himself.The Long Take took four years to research and write. I read extensively: histories of America, accounts of the Normandy landings (and, in particular, the experiences of the North Nova Scotia Highlanders), but I mostly watched films – about 500 from the mid 40s to the late 50s – for style and tone, for language, but also for geographical detail. I have to experience landscape to write about it, and I could walk through Inverness County in Cape Breton, or down the old streets of Manhattan and San Francisco, but the area of Los Angeles that I concentrate on in the book, Bunker Hill, no longer exists. This once-genteel residential district high above downtown was targeted by corrupt property developers and, in the late 50s, its 130 acres of community housing was demolished and the hill levelled by 100 feet. Apart from being home to more than 8,000 people, Bunker Hill had been used since Charlie Chaplin’s day as a free open-air film set, because the Queen Anne houses were shabby and interesting, and the elevation of the hill – with its views and its stairs and tunnels – made for dramatic location shots. The angles looked even better at night, so it became film noir’s outdoor shooting stage. There are almost no contemporary maps of the area, so I had to piece together the geography of this lost heart of LA from still photographs and all these hundreds of movies. Like my protagonist I was looking for a way to fix this world, so I watched the films and drew it. I made myself a map.Everything UnderIt is hard to know now why I first began writing Everything Under. Why that idea, rather than any other, was the one that finally stuck and could not be shaken loose. I was working on the collection of stories that would later become my first book, Fen. I had an itch to write something longer that would challenge me in a different way. I had become obsessed with the idea of retelling. I loved the act of destruction that was required, the way a new story could emerge from the bones of an old one. I had always been inspired by myth, particularly Greek myth, and its befuddlement of metamorphosis, beauty and violence. Friends were working on feminist retellings of Orpheus – the musician with his lyre who descends into the underworld to rescue his love – but I knew I wanted something darker.The myth I decided on is taut with violence and horror, a tumbling shocker of a story that drags you to its inevitable, fated end. I was drawn to the gaps I imagined I would be able to fill, the characters who seemed nearly silenced. I was reading short stories by Sarah Hall, Kelly Link, Claire Vaye Watkins and Karen Russell. I appreciated their bold weirdness, the way the normal was infected with strangeness. I was thinking a lot about the uncanny, the idea of home – a seeming place of comfort – turned dangerous and forbidding. I loved apocalyptic fiction with the sense of impending doom and nature turned villain. I carried a number of books around with me that I knew were doing something similar to what I wanted to do: All the Birds, Singing by Evie Wyld, Miss Smilla’s Feeling for Snow by Peter Høeg, White Is for Witching by Helen Oyeyemi.I could feel the idea of a story trembling inside me. I always find the early days of a project fraught and exciting, the ideas composting, mulching together.I’d written novels before but never successfully. I felt I was learning as I went along, fumbling for the right way. The first draft was no good. The second, third, fourth and fifth draft were also no good, the setting was wrong, or the voice or the characters. It was lifeless. I wrote quickly and deleted almost everything. I despaired, but I was also learning what the book was about, hacking the story out of the mess.One summer, my partner and I borrowed a canal boat and motored around the Oxford waterways. The river was tangled and thick with undergrowth. I heaved open the locks and watched the water spilling in or seeping away. I saw a dead sheep half submerged and began to almost believe that lurking roots and branches were creatures in the murky water. I’d been working on Everything Under for a few years and the setting had changed three or four times, never seeming quite right. The first night on the boat I couldn’t sleep for the noise of animals in the undergrowth and, perhaps, in the water the cold through the hull.

Everything Under is about memory and its tenuous hold, the impact of language on our nature, the way rural wildness can inhabit us. It is a book about family and female relationships.

The film, After the Battle, can be seen currently on BBC iPlayer, and in it Murrow smokes tremendously (a 70-a-day habit that killed him six years later) as he asks a selection of Britons about class difference, industrial unrest and where they feel the country is heading. At last he reaches the climax: an interview of impressive verbosity with the Tory foreign secretary, Selwyn Lloyd.I was 14 at the time. In terms of age, I am, if you like, an average member of today’s Tory party. Research published last year by the Bow Group estimated members’ average age at 72: people who, like me, were born in 1944 or 1945, and can recall the death of King George VI as well as more cheerful happenings such as Muffin the Mule, the coronation, Take It from Here, and steam-hauled expresses to the seaside. Only the hardest of hearts could be proof against the charm of these things.On the other hand, Britain in the 1950s was a harder and less Enid Blyton-y place than a Cath Kidston shop window would have us believe. As well as Dinky Toys, it had atom bombs – symbols of the widespread belief, shared far beyond Lloyd and the Tory party, that Britain’s special history merited a special destiny. It could never be “just another country”.Throughout the years of imperial retreat and deindustrialisation, that belief has shrunk, though most people of my generation, including me, can still find some recalcitrant traces of it in our tastes, interests and prejudices. It persists at its most florid in the popular press and, more crucially, almost as a founding belief in the Europhobic wing of the Conservative party and throughout Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party. These parliamentary groupings, with a total of no more than 50 to 70 MPs, at present seem to have the future of the United Kingdom under their thumb.Until the referendum both groups looked to be in long-term decline, as representatives of generations and traditions that were dying. Tory party membership now stands at roughly 124,000, less than a quarter of Labour’s membership and slightly lower than the SNP’s. (The Bow Group’s estimate of the average age is contested even so, most other estimates have it between 57 and 70.) About 1,100 people are thought to belong to the Democratic Unionist party (founded in 1971 by Ian Paisley). Their average age isn’t known, but a high proportion of members and elected representatives belong to the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster (founded in 1951 by Ian Paisley) or the Orange Order, or both.What did I know of Northern Ireland as a 14-year-old in 1959? Beyond the fact that the police carried pistols – my parents had seen them on a holiday in Portrush – almost nothing at all. Then, slowly, a picture emerged of flute bands and marches and a love of the union jack – a theatrical patriotism that was already dying in the land over the water to which they were pledging their loyalty. They, or at least the majority population, were unionists. We in Scotland were unionists too.Save for Northern Ireland’s Catholics and a scattering of nationalists in Scotland and Wales, everyone was a unionist it was a state of being that outside Northern Ireland needed neither thought nor description. How strange then that unionism should be threatened, finally, by the Orange halls of the six counties and Conservative clubs in the shires: the kind of places where people can still sing Land of Hope and Glory without any irony and believe Britain is a free country like no other.The fact is that Brexit matters to them more. Polls conducted in June for the universities of Edinburgh and Cardiff – the latest in a series known as the Future of England Study – show, to quote this week’s press release, that “self-professed unionists, most notably leave-voting Conservatives, were largely unconcerned about the risks to the union posed by Brexit”.In the words of Ailsa Henderson, professor of political science at Edinburgh: “If even unionists in Northern Ireland care less about the territorial integrity of the UK than pursuing Brexit, then it really raises questions about the type of union we’re in, and indeed what unionism means.”Meaning is certainly hard to find. Unionism, like Banksy’s Girl With Balloon, is eating itself in public. In future, the burden of once-greatness will have to be carried by England alone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e33a2af9a944f58d6b78f7d8a6ee5b39ea6c8bb4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b780e07d6cd8ef8c2bcd0ae1016ce52","title":"labour jeremy corbyn british politics tories","story":"Those who call his leadership a cult fail to understand Labour’s invigorated base. The Tories could learn from thisDuring May’s local elections, Ilford Conservative party printed and distributed a leaflet with no policies and no achievements, bearing the headline, “What we’re doinghave done for wardarea name”. It had mistakenly put out a template. Underneath came numbered bullet points next to a list of what were intended to be accomplishments, which began: “Issue 1 We’ve done: Three lines of text about what issuesprojectspolicies you’ve already done or are doing or will be doing in your wardarea.” It continued all the way up to Issue 4.Since the Brexit referendum, the Conservatives have conducted themselves less like a party fit to govern than a calamitous metaphor fit for a meme. If May is not coughing, she’s dancing if the party conference slogan isn’t falling off the wall during her speech, it juxtaposes the promise “Security, Stability, Opportunity” in 2015 with just “Opportunity” this year. A near-empty conference hall addressed by ministers sits tellingly beside a bustling fringe where leadership contenders top the bill. With the rhetorical vacuity, scripted conviction and managed spontaneity laid bare, all that is left is a hollow shell where a political party might be.Just over three years after Jeremy Corbyn won Labour’s leadership election, our understanding of the role a party can play in political life has been reimagined. Not so long ago, parties stood for electoral power. Anything less was irrelevant anything more was unnecessary. It was a feat to be attained not through active engagement with members and voters, but to be directed by a professional class of politicians and their advisers, pollsters and marketers. If turnout plummeted, disaffection grew or confidence in the process dissipated, never mind. (Paradoxically, many of those in New Labour who clung most fiercely to this credo are also those most incandescent at one of its most obvious consequences: Brexit.) Politics, crudely reduced to electoralism, was not something people got involved in but something that was imposed on them.“The age of party democracy has passed,” the late Irish political scientist Peter Mair declared in Ruling the Void, published posthumously in 2013, two years after he died. “Although the parties themselves remain, they have become so disconnected from the wider society and pursue a form of competition that is so lacking meaning that they no longer seem capable of sustaining democracy in its present form.”Under Corbyn’s leadership, that began to change. Indeed, his very election to leader – which twice pitted members foursquare against the parliamentary party and twice saw members prevail – shows that he is not only an agent of that change but a product of it. Labour’s membership has virtually trebled in size, now standing at around 550,000. Anything that grows that fast and shifts its orientation that dramatically will have challenges. Many new members are passive some prioritise a left agenda within the party others see the party as a route to social activism in their communities some joined because they want to get rid of Corbyn.Corbyn’s political beliefs and abilities as leader have been debated endlessly by many on these pages, myself included. But the point here is not about him, but the nature of the party he now leads, and which now stands transformed. There are some, of course, who are either unwilling or unable to make that distinction. Branding those who support his leadership a “cult”, they insist this is merely evidence of blind personal devotion.In any case, if it is a cult, it’s not a very good one. Cults, by definition, are bodies of tight discipline and mass orthodoxy – that was New Labour. It in no way describes the party at present. At this year’s party conference there were profound disagreements among people who support Corbyn – over Brexit, a second referendum and party democracy.Some constituency delegates booed and berated union leaders when proposals to democratise the party were watered down. Similarly there was heckling and cheering of speakers making arguments for and against a second referendum on Brexit, and whether there should be a remain option. One needn’t endorse the jeering to acknowledge that it emerged from what was clearly a spirited and engaged debate. People felt they had a stake.The Conservative party could learn a lot from this.All the energy last week was outside the official conference. That says a great deal. It has fewer members than the Scottish National party, which stands only in Scotland. According to the Tory party’s own accounts last year it received twice as much in donations from the dead, in the form of legacy payments, as from the living. It lost half its membership between 2005 and 2013. And roughly half of those who remain would like to bring back the death penalty.Electorally, the Tories still dominate. Most polls give them a slender lead, they are in government, and last year they won their highest vote share since 1983. However, even at the ballot box they are vulnerable. They have won an outright majority only once since 1992 – and they held that for just two years, during which they managed to call a referendum and lose it.But politically, they barely function. Woefully out of touch with their base, their most recent upturn in membership came primarily from people joining because they opposed the Chequers agreement. Most joined not to participate in policymaking but in anticipation of a coup. Meanwhile, like the Ilford election pamphlet, the party is little more than a template, lacking policies, achievement or ideas.The electoral and the political are, of course, connected. An invigorated base will not only stuff envelopes and knock on doors – it will argue for you at school gates, and in pubs and university refectories. When we have a hung parliament, in which 52 MPs have a majority of fewer than 1,000, and 11 were elected with margins of fewer than 100, that can make all the difference.The point here is not that the nation would be better served by a more rightwing Tory party – it wouldn’t – but that our political culture would benefit from the Tory party engaging its base and hosting those debates, rather than suppressing them so that it can cling on to power – which at this point is its sole function. The government is being held to ransom by hardliners with no plausible policies, vision or strategy, who are able to thrive precisely because that vision goes untested and unchallenged. The problem is not only that the tail is wagging the dog, but that the dog has been neutered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ad29ece82935cdf4a6cc685049e6cd569d309c3/0_88_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cb3559c344d3aff592a795a9d02193c","title":"universal credit welfare reform benefit rollout","story":"Even Esther McVey has admitted some welfare claimants will be worse off under the benefit – the rollout must be stopped• Universal credit: May faces revolt after McVey admits some will be worse offLabour has been demanding the government halt the rollout of universal credit for months. And in the last few days, two former prime ministers – from different sides of the political spectrum – have condemned the government’s failure to protect welfare claimants. On Thursday, the Cabinet member responsible for this iniquitous Tory scheme, Esther McVey, directly contradicted Theresa May by admitting live on TV that some people will be worse off under universal credit. A Tory backbencher followed by attacking his own government’s programme.It feels like the tide is turning.If you’re a user of this country’s underfunded welfare system, then you’ve probably been desperate for change for a long time. The Conservatives say they have “redesigned the welfare system to make it fit for the 21st century”. But their flagship welfare reform programme has put claimants in rent arrears it means people may be unable to afford their gas or electricity bill it may force them to go to a food bank for the first time.That’s the true story of universal credit.The scheme could hardly have a worse reputation, beset as it has been by delays, resets and incompetence. However, the Conservatives are about to embark on a new phase of the programme that is fraught with risk and which will make things a whole lot worse.So-called managed migration will take nearly 3 million people claiming “old-style” benefits such as jobseeker’s allowance, employment support allowance and tax credits, and “migrate” them on to universal credit.But it looks like it will be anything but “managed”.The government will be sending millions of people letters telling them that their existing benefits are coming to an end, and that they will have a month to claim universal credit.If they do not claim in time, some could lose their entire income overnight. This could happen for lots of reasons – for example, if their letter gets lost in the post, if they do not understand the instructions, or if they are not able to gather their documents in time.How often have you forgotten or ignored an envelope on the mat? It’s easy to do, especially if you’re already finding life stressful and difficult. But as a consequence of doing just that, some people may only find out that they need to make a claim for universal credit once their existing benefits stop and their money is cut off. Imagine the appalling impact that could have on a family. It’s deeply unjust that, for some households, this will mean that vital income has been cut off and they cannot pay their rent or food bills.Many people affected by this are in jobs and claim working tax credits. For many parents juggling one or two jobs, and childcare as well, it can be really hard to find the time at the end of the day to fill in a complex form. Nearly half of people need help to complete their universal credit claim: that’s how difficult it is to fill in.Most will have no idea that the deadline for a claim can be extended unless they receive expert advice, but in any case advice agencies are stretched to the limit as a result of government cuts. Often it can take more than a month to get to see someone.Losing your entire income overnight is a terrifying thought for anybody. But it is even worse if you have an illness or a disability. No income may mean that you cannot eat properly, or that you can’t store your medication because you can’t pay to keep the electricity on and your fridge working. More than one in three people who will be affected claim employment and support allowance, meaning they are too ill or disabled to seek work. It will be particularly hard for those people to switch from one system to another in a short period of time – and the punishment that this government will impose on them if they fail to do so will be particularly cruel.There is a real danger that many people will fall out of the social security system altogether because they are unable to make a claim at all. People with a learning disability, low literacy levels or poor IT skills are particularly at risk. Again, imagine the impact on a vulnerable person of losing the income that they need.Ministers must stop and listen to the people who are going to be hit by these changes. They must listen to the 80 disability organisations that are warning that these plans will endanger some of the most vulnerable people in our society. They must listen to organisations such as Citizens Advice, the Child Poverty Action Group and the mayor of London, who are all opposing the plans. And they must listen to the National Audit Office, which has said that the Department for Work and Pensions should not proceed unless it is clear that universal credit can cope with business-as-usual operations.The government must stop the rollout of universal credit. Failure to do so risks human catastrophe.• Margaret Greenwood is MP for Wirral West and Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8c7dc8481d444dd8b266e52c80f94fdd951b4bf/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11c1e3f18a6ce7ba281b303b1067caca","title":"youve got to admire tilda swintons balls","story":"Her makeover for the film Suspiria was pretty convincing, but there are lessons to be learned from her transformationThe chameleon actor has done it again. It turns out Tilda Swinton does play the elderly male character Dr Josef Klemperer in the remake of supernatural thriller Suspiria after all. This despite the fact that the film-makers had tried to throw everyone off the scent with an IMDb biography entry for a fake actor called Lutz Ebersdorf. In hindsight, this was a bit lame as Ebersdorf had never been cast in anything else, but just happened to land third lead in a major movie. Then there was a supplementary denial by the director, who called the suspicions that Ebersdorf was Swinton “fake news”. As everybody knows, whenever anybody says “fake news”, it is in fact true.For some reason, despite the fact that I’m not especially observant, I didn’t even need to apply this metric. I saw the picture of Swinton’s face alongside the snaps of the character and I knew instinctively, rationally and with every pore of my being that this was indeed Tilda Swinton.This might suggest that the makeup artist hadn’t done a good job. Not so. It’s a fine job. Makeup artists are the unsung heroes of culture (everyone always talks through the bit when their Oscar is presented). Swinton’s face was beautifully altered, the lines engraved with precision during four hours of makeup each day.No stone was left unturned in pursuit of becoming Dr Josef Klemperer. Swinton even wore genitals. Mark Coulier, the lead makeup artist, told the New York Times: “She had this nice, weighty set of genitalia so that she could feel it dangling between her legs and she managed to get it out on set on a couple of occasions.” Fancy.They clearly went to a lot of trouble. But why? Some smart arses have suggested it’s so that Swinton could overcome systematic pay inequality. This suggests if female actors want to boost their salaries, they will have to pretend to be male and take on multiple parts in the same movie.There’s part of me that believes that habitual disguisers and dressers-up are a bit addicted to it, that they get more out of it than the audience. This is something to bear in mind as we approach Halloween, which has become peak costume season for non-actors. Single-use Halloween costumes, primarily made from plastic-based textiles, generate 12,500 tonnes of extra waste that will be sent to landfill or incinerated. So this year my plea is for restraint. There is simply no need to take it to Swinton levels. We know it’s you anyway.At the New York film festival, Liam Neeson recounted how on the set of his latest movie, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, a horse recognised him and began pawing the ground and whinnying. At first, I thought Mr Neeson was making a comment about his general level of celebrity and might be under the impression that all horses recognised him (as many humans would, no doubt). But then I saw that he had worked with the horse before.Animal psychologists confirmed that horses can remember and react fondly to people that they associate with positive memories, especially where they have been given food. Neeson said he had talked to the horse and fed it apples.I like this story on many levels. I like it when other species are revealed to have more sophisticated cognitive processes than originally believed. Cows can recognise friends in the herd, for example. Plus, in this fast-paced world, it is nice if any freelance colleague remembers you in between jobs, irrespective of species.But, still, the real experiment is yet to be conducted: if Liam Neeson was disguised as Tilda Swinton, would the horse still recognise him?I spent my adolescence in the neighbouring county to Tullamore, County Offaly, and can confirm that the Irish market town was not then renowned as a social justice leader. Instead it was known for Tullamore Dew, an Irish whiskey still to be found on sale in earthenware flasks at the airport next to the leprechaun magnets.But that changed last week when the deportation of a Tullamore schoolboy, Nonso Muojeke, 14, was halted, in part because of a sustained, high-energy campaign calling on the Irish government to grant him leave of remain, conducted by his classmates. After repeated appeals failed, Nonso’s classmates refused to let it lie.The news clips of their victory have been a thing of joy. There’s Nonso’s obvious relief that he and his mother and brother will no longer be deported to Nigeria, a country he left aged two and where they would be under threat.Nonso’s teachers pointed out that appealing against the deportation order had provided “incredible lessons for students”, deftly signalling that all key competences as laid out by the curriculum have been covered.But curriculum-linked or not, it seems the emergent generation doesn’t just gripe about unjust immigration – it is actively inclined to do something about it. Tullamore’s protest mirrors that of Elin Ersson, the Swedish student who refused to allow the deportation of an Afghan man recently on a Turkish Airlines flight.• Lucy Siegle is a journalist who writes about ethical living"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0c24c63cd2bbc7d2727455d3111aa7f5a962c6/502_65_1965_1179/master/1965.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9f8827e9a86f3588adbba38b586c602","title":"drew barrymore egyptair celebrity interview","story":"It’s no surprise that the actor’s interview was completely real. At junkets, the questions often swing between sycophancy and snarkBarrymore’s representatives insisted the actor did not “technically sit down with EgyptAir for an interview”, but they had to admit the quotes came from a real press conference. Also known as “junkets” or “round tables”, these sessions typically involve an actor talking to multiple journalists at once the writers, often from different countries, then translate the quotes and stitch them together into some kind of article. So the real joke is that the interview – albeit translated first into Arabic and then back, badly, into English – was completely real.My own career as a celebrity interviewer began promisingly. Aged 18, and still at university, I spoke to a British actor who had recently quit a play early in its run.“What would you say to people who say it’s your fault the play has now closed?” I asked, in all my wide-eyed starstruck innocence.“What would you say if I called you a bitch?” he snapped back.What I didn’t know then was that this was a rare – valuable, even – experience, in that I got a glimpse of the celebrity’s true self. When I tell people now that my job involves talking to famous people they tend to imagine I live the life of the kid in Cameron Crowe’s Almost Famous, who goes on the road with a band in the 1970s. But that era of journalism vanished along with mullets, alas.I am lucky to work at the , where editors insist that any interview must include at least an hour of one-on-one time: no stitched together random quotes here. But I have sat in on these round tables and the questions invariably swing between sycophancy and snark – partly because those are the approaches most likely to get some kind of reaction, and partly because the journalists are from different countries and some jokes get lost in translation.“Ms Winslet, how do you feel about being such an icon of beauty?” I once heard a French fashion writer ask Kate Winslet backstage at the Baftas, a question to which there is truly no good answer. At a press conference with the notoriously temperamental and five-times-married James Cameron, one German journalist decided to kick off proceedings with “So James, why do you keep dumping your wives?”One-on-one interviews can be just as strange. At their worst, these are held in a hotel, where journalists queue outside a room and are marched in, one at a time. There is something weirdly transactional about the whole thing: all those shifty hacks waiting to go into a hotel room where someone far more beautiful is primed to give them what they need. Similarly, the celebrity is expected to offer up the most intimate details of their life to sell a movie and make money. The comparisons with sex work are obvious. Well, to me, anyway. “It’s a bit like being in a brothel,” I once cheerfully said to a publicist, while waiting to interview Oprah Winfrey. Handy hint for aspiring journalists: don’t say this.And then there are the celebrities themselves who, given half a chance, revert to bland celeb-speak, the verbal equivalent of muzak, because they’re trying to avoid saying anything too personal or – God forbid – controversial. I once interviewed Cameron Diaz and she used the word “journey” a total of – I kid you not – 12 times.And yet, the high points of my career have all involved talking to celebrities: spending a weekend with Judy Blume meeting Michael J Fox in his office acting out a scene from Moonstruck with Nicolas Cage. And my favourite pieces of journalism are celebrity interviews, because, when done well, they reveal something about the culture we live in, told through a very human story. But those are the organic versions most interviews are now battery-farmed junkets which reveal nothing beyond a publication’s desperation for a famous face to slap on its cover.The joke about EgyptAir’s interview is not that it was so bad, but that it’s so typical of the genre the airline’s only mistake was not getting a better translator. At least readers now know how deranged these celebrity junkets are – and for that I thank EgyptAir for showing us the truth, and in this way nurturing our small bodies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e3be3fdc39607b22b71b6329c2a4412abb77c12/0_588_7206_4324/master/7206.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5dc68ea7629a0d3c63d1cb2443de0ab","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A rhinoceros hornbill and a white moray eel are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca454fbc7faf6cbac3e9c07e40f126760c1e4198/382_358_4323_2594/master/4323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0af1bae9d30f7b77ab4b572f0b98592","title":"makeup for men beauty trend","story":"Tom Ford and Chanel have launched male cosmetics, and foundation is the norm on TV shows from Love Island to Bodyguard. But does a bit of eyeliner work for everyone? One writer put it to the test…I’m looking at the man in the mirror. And he looks great, to be honest. It’s how I feel I should look, when I am at my most optimistic. There’s a smooth sheen across my cheeks. My eyes are bright, my brows orderly.Women know, obviously. For the last century, makeup has been mostly the preserve of just half the population. Even as society has become more feminist, and less ruled by gender binaries, women’s cosmetics use has become even more prolific, while men have continued to go au naturel, occasionally boshing on a bit of moisturiser and hoping for the best.But that may be changing, as brands from Chanel to Tom Ford launch male cosmetics lines, which is why I’ve asked for a makeover. My “before” photos leave no doubt as to where the disaster zones are. I’m youngish, but the skin under my beard is parched, there are red blotches across my face equator, my squinty eyes are sunken and there’s lots of white flakiness in the deep valleys between the shaft of my nose and the foothills of my nostrils.My new “natural” look involves about 11 different products. The first round of five or so I recognise: toners, moisturisers, a calming face mist. Nothing girly about that, I think. This is just skincare my bathroom cabinet is full of this nonsense. Then comes the foundation, filter, powder, two different kinds of colour correction, concealer, eyebrow brush and lip gloss.As with the boom in female beauty, the charge is being led by ordinary teenagers making videos in their bedrooms. James Charles from upstate New York was 16 when he launched his first makeup tutorial on YouTube. In it, he demonstrates how to do a complex contoured look with a deep blue eye-shadow glow, completely transforming his face. By the age of 18, Charles had amassed 8.5 million subscribers and become the first man to model for makeup brand CoverGirl.Both Thompson and Charles are model-like, and their makeup looks are full-on and feminine: lots of contouring, bronzer and colour. Both are gay queer culture has always appropriated elements of femininity, particularly makeup. As Thompson says, “Makeup connects with queer culture – it’s such a powerful form of expression.”The question, though, is whether the Towie boys and the high-profile vloggers doing deals with mainstream beauty brands could signal a tipping point where male makeup becomes more commercially viable. I have my reservations, not least because we’ve been here before. In the kohl-and-cocaine mid-00s, front pages were dominated by the fabulous lashes of Pete Doherty, Noel Fielding and Russell Brand. Piggybacking on that trend, Superdrug tried to launch a “guyliner” and “manscara” in 2008. Both products flopped.Bunny Kinney, editor of Dazed Beauty magazine, tells me he’s starting to hear major brands talk about male makeup, but that there’s a long way to go before blokes in towns across Britain start powdering their noses before a night out. “In spite of all the amazing, radical progress that’s being made with regards to gender nonconformity, beauty still very much exists on that mainstream binary. For things like male foundation, getting rid of that stigma is going to be hard.”Back in the makeup chair, I ask Cooper to give me a slightly more full-on look: eye shadow, contouring, glow on my cheekbones (pictured above). How do I look? Yes, my eyes are “popping”, but it’s extremely noticeable and I feel uncomfortable. I keep the makeup on, and later bump into some friends. “You’re wearing makeup,” they say by way of a hello. I don’t know the unspoken rule that you don’t touch your face when wearing makeup by the time I meet my girlfriend an hour later, everything has smeared. What do you think, I ask? She looks at me with undisguised amusement – a vain melting goth in the middle of St Pancras station. “I’m surprised by how unashamed you are,” she says.One brand believes it can beat the kneejerk unease men have about makeup. It’s called MMUK. On sale exclusively through Asos, it has grown to become the biggest male-focused makeup brand in Europe, with a turnover last year of £1m.MMUK is based in Brighton, where I meet its founder, Alex Dalley. After watching plenty of beauty vlogs, I have certain preconceptions, so I am surprised to be greeted by a man in a plain white T-shirt and black exercise shorts that expose his tree-trunk, rugby-player legs. He calls me “fella”.Dalley says his interest in makeup started when he was a teenager: he is blind in one eye and had terrible acne, and would regularly miss school because he didn’t want anyone to see his visible disability. “I’m surprised I ever left my bedroom,” he says.On the night of the lower-sixth prom, his mother convinced him to try foundation. The result was life-changing. “I remember looking in the mirror and feeling like myself again,” Dalley says. It kickstarted a fascination with bronzers and concealers, although he remained too frightened to buy anything himself, sending his mum off to Boots to shop for him.While studying business at Sussex University, he did some market research and was surprised to find there weren’t any male beauty brands. He began developing a business plan, and when he left university, tried to make it a reality, setting up a website and using his overdraft to buy up cheap, discontinued Calvin Klein women’s makeup, which he then marketed at men.Straight away, Dalley was making more than £1,000 a month by convincing men they were buying male makeup when they weren’t. He included tutorials and guides, showing men the basics of foundation, powder and concealer (his site was also the first that came up if you Googled “makeup for men”). Eventually, he ran out of the Calvin Klein stock, so he started investing in his own products. Dalley initially assumed the primary interest would be from gay men, and took out adverts in Attitude and Gay Times. But he quickly found that gay consumers made up only a quarter of his customer base.MMUK changed the tone of the language on the website, and took out references to nights out and “wingmen” to make it appealing to all age groups, and watched the business grow. In 2017, it got a distribution deal with Asos Dalley now plans to expand into 12 new territories next year.He says the success of the products is down to their formulations, which are different from women’s brands. They need to last longer, because there’s no way men will keep makeup in their bag or touch up in the bathroom (many of MMUK’s customers request the makeup to be delivered in plain packaging or addressed to a female name). Most importantly, each product is essentially designed to be invisible. The foundations are matte and come in a wide range of skin tones and types. The lip glosses are clear the bronzers aim to make you look tanned, rather than to glow.I wonder how Dalley feels about the market expanding, with bigger brands muscling in on his turf. “I think Chanel, Tom Ford – they’re tokens. It’s all just marketing. They’ve just added the word ‘boy’ or ‘for men’. They haven’t had the balls to say, ‘Let’s really step away and create a whole range.’”Thompson, who vlogs mostly about using women’s makeup to achieve his looks, agrees, adding that, just as female ranges have for decades given women of colour few options, these nascent ranges for men don’t cater for darker skin types. “With Chanel, it’s amazing that they are doing a men’s makeup range, but those shades? Why even bother if you don’t cater to all the men around the world?”I’m interested by Dalley’s offering. Until now, my skincare routine has involved picking up free samples at airports. So, heading off to a night out at a Frieze art fair afterparty, I pick up a bag of MMUK’s makeup. Already I see a problem: I need somewhere to apply it. I try a few bars, but the men’s toilets are busy and I don’t feel comfortable standing by the sink applying foundation while men in suits urinate behind me. Eventually, I settle for a toilet cubicle in a train station pub and try my best with the mirror in the compact.Having watched Cooper, I feel as if I know what I’m doing, but I quickly phone my girlfriend to make sure I’ve got the order right (I haven’t). I start with the foundation, which looks good until I get some on my beard, creating a horrible tartare-sauce look that is difficult to get off. After that, it’s concealer and powder and I try to fix my eyebrows, too.At the party, I meet up with some of my oldest friends. I expect them to bring it up immediately, but no one does when I mention that I’m wearing makeup, they say my skin looks glowing. Still, it doesn’t really make me feel more confident I worry that I’m coming across too Towie at a party that’s much more Broad City.One man who wants bring makeup out of the shadows is Jay Jay Revlon. After completing a nail technician course earlier this year, he set up the only male nail salon in the UK, as a popup in the corner of a pub. The technicians were men, and people could order a pint while they had their nails looked at.Like MMUK, Revlon found that he was getting a range of customers. “Nail biters were my key clientele,” he says. He’d give gel extensions for a natural look, as well as offering black or glitter nails the salon also gave manicures to those who just “want their hands sorting out”.Revlon says the long-term aim is a permanent space, “where men come and get their nails done, but can also do other stuff. It can be a social space, a safe space for LGBT people.” His dream is to have a salon where men can go to get their makeup sorted.There is a brand of socially conditioned masculinity that might stop me having a cupboard full of products, or powdering my nose in the loos of a commuter-friendly Wetherspoons. But would I pop to a male makeup bar and get my face done before a big night out? I already go to the barbers, where my eyebrows are plucked, my hands massaged and my beard trimmed to the millimetre. If they chucked in a little foundation and some colour corrector for the weekend – well, I wouldn’t say no. • Commenting on this piece?

They discuss equal pay, the pain of discovering your club has folded and being harsh about each other’s gamesChris Wood and Kirsty Linnett remember vividly the day the reality of life as a professional football couple became far removed from the dream. It was Friday 21 April 2017 and the two strikers, then of Leeds United and Notts County Ladies, were settling into the first home they had bought together two months earlier. As was their new puppy, Luna. It was also two days before the Women’s Super League Spring Series was due to start for Linnett with a trip to Arsenal.“Kirsty came home and said: ‘Our club is no more,’” recalls Wood. “I said: ‘That can’t be possible. Notts County has folded?’ And she said: ‘No, just our side of it.’”Linnett elaborates: “I don’t know how you can liquidate one side of a club and not the other. No one got a penny after that day but the PFA were really helpful. We had just got a house together and a puppy, and within two months I had to move to Reading and straight into a club house with four other girls. I can see the business side of it, our debt was half a million, but a lot of men’s teams are losing millions at every level of the game so that wasn’t a valid excuse to me. There are girls I know from that team who had no family support in the area and never found a team again.”Both players have moved on since their planned life near Sheffield was brought to an abrupt halt. Four months later Wood joined Burnley for a club record £15m and Linnett, following her spell at Reading, signed for Liverpool Women during August. The north-west is home at last for the couple – and Luna – after the best part of three years living apart and six-hour round trips to see each other on occasional days off.The liquidation of Notts County Ladies – relaunched as Notts County Women at a lower level this season – “would never happen in the men’s game”, Wood insists. “Things happen in the women’s game that should not happen.” He is in a good position to judge and to act.As New Zealand’s vice-captain and a board member of the New Zealand Professional Footballers’ Association, the 26-year-old helped broker a historic deal in May that gave the national women’s team – the Football Ferns – the same pay, prize money, image rights and travel conditions as the men. His partner’s experience with Notts County had a direct impact on Wood’s home life but was not the first “eye opener”, as he calls it.From the age of four to 12 the Burnley centre-forward played in the same teams as his older sister, Chelsey, who competed at World Cups for New Zealand at under-17 and under-20 level. The sacrifices his sister made and the struggles Linnett faces have made Wood a committed advocate of better conditions in the women’s game.“Once my eyes were opened it was a no-brainer,” he says. “It wasn’t about having a girlfriend who plays football or a sister who plays football, it was about doing what is right. These people are professional athletes. They give up just as much time and effort, if not more, than we do as men. In New Zealand if you want to be in the national team you have to give up your lifestyle and move to Auckland. If you live in Christchurch or Wellington you have to move to Auckland to train and play, and off your own bat. You weren’t subsidised, you weren’t given anything to start with, you just had to move.“The coaches and the head of New Zealand football are based in Auckland. They want them to train together as a team regularly to improve and I am all for that, but they were not getting the help they needed to set up in new jobs or new housing or anything like that to help with the transition. They have given up their livelihoods to train three or four times a week and play at the weekend in Auckland. Once my eyes were opened to that I saw the way it should be and that it should change around.”Wood says there was no resistance when, having been asked by the Ferns to help negotiate improved terms, he discussed equal conditions with PFA board members and his international teammates. He explains: “As soon as I opened their eyes to what the Football Ferns are going through their reaction was the same as mine: what can we do to help? It was perfect timing because the negotiations for the next four-year campaign were coming up.“It was a case of, ‘Look boys, we take what we are on and don’t push for any more but we ask for the Ferns to be on exactly the same as us.’ It was a massive step in history but it was the right thing to do. They should be on exactly the same as us. It’s the same life.”Both players stress during the interview, which took place at the back of a Costa Coffee in Cheshire, that the good of a professional life in football together far outweighs the bad. Wood came to England at 16 for a trial with West Bromwich Albion and had six loan moves before establishing himself at Leicester, Leeds and in the Premier League with Burnley.Linnett lost two years of her career to two cruciate injuries before coming back at the highest level with Birmingham City, Reading and Liverpool. They view the short-lived house move and difficult starts to the season with their respective clubs as part of the job better conditions for women as a common and necessary cause.“Football always comes first,” says Linnett, who admits the couple are “harsh on each other sometimes” but know when to offer constructive criticism or just say nothing about the other’s performance. They also never argue over the remote control as football is always on television at home. “That’s what all the lads say to me at training – you get to watch football all the time,” Wood says.Linnett adds: “We grew up wanting to be professional footballers and it is amazing we have that opportunity. It will be great to look back when we are older and say we were both professional footballers and got to live our dreams.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b20e6c5ca6bd3eac38230f533e0592bf3c231cf/0_204_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=542b955174f2640bf596b6922eb2dd11","title":"football ref hostile players irate fans decisions","story":"From the horror of making a mistake to the teams that came armed with knives, football’s unsung heroes share their storiesIt is a wet Saturday morning in September, the kind when the prickling heat of August feels a distant memory. In Regent’s Park in London, a man in a black shirt, shorts and socks jogs over to a group of parents watching their 14-year-olds warm up in the drizzle. He’s clutching two small flags, each in fluorescent yellow and orange. “I need two linesmen,” he says. Technically, he should say “assistant referees”, but we all know what he means.I step forward. A few days earlier, I had met one of Britain’s leading assistant referees – whose decisions have seen him jeered from the stands and mocked in the House of Commons. This might give me an inkling of what his job entails.I try to remember what he told me: when one team is attacking my half, I don’t watch the ball I look across the pitch, along the line of the last defender, to see if any attacking player is about to run offside. I sprint up and down the touchline, level with that last defender, but also look up and down my own touchline to see if the ball is going out of play. And I have to keep an eye on the progress of the game generally, to see if there’s anything I need to signal to the referee.I’m looking in three directions at once, while sprinting. So rather than staying behind the touchline, I’m zigzagging on and off the pitch. At least there are only a couple of dozen people watching, and no one’s throwing bottles.As I run past the attacking team’s substitutes, I hear one moan: “This is the worse lino I’ve ever seen.” I flag an attacker offside and the coach shouts as I run past: “He has to be offside when the ball is played, not when he gets the ball!”I know, I say, and he was.“You’re supposed to be in line!”I know, I say, and I was.“You’re not even a proper linesman.”I know, I say, and I’m only doing it so your sons can have a game, so maybe stop giving me shit, eh? Especially as your lot are already winning 5-0.Things are not helped when one of the defending team shouts, “Well done, lino, great call!” – largely because he’s my son.The drizzle descends. I get wetter and wetter. The longer the game goes on, the more I pray for it to end. It’s hard, really hard. And I’m not even the referee.Referees have long been the most reviled people in football. From children’s matches, where under-8s re-enact the cheating of the professional game, to the Premier League, where tens of thousands of people gather to sing, to the tune of Blue Moon, “Shit ref  You’re just another shit ref”, to be a match official is to be, in the vernacular of football, “the bastard in the black”. And yet the UK has thousands of them, paid a pittance to get shouted at by hungover parents, or picked apart on social media, or found wanting by TV pundits. They turn out in rain, snow or sun, with none of the glory you get from playing. What is it like to spend your weekends travelling to out-of-the-way grounds to referee a game only 125 people care about? Why get out of bed on a Sunday morning to keep order among 22 blokes who smell of last night’s beer?If today’s levels of online abuse can seem disproportionate, it was ever thus. In Yorkshire, they still curse the name of Ray Tinkler, the referee who in April 1971 allowed West Bromwich Albion to score a goal Leeds United believed cost them the league title fans – not hooligans, but irate middle-aged men in raincoats – invaded the pitch. It didn’t matter that Tinkler’s decision was right. In January 2000, a snarling pack of Manchester United players led by Roy Keane surrounded Andy D’Urso after he awarded Middlesbrough a penalty at Old Trafford. In March 2005, Swedish referee Anders Frisk retired early when his family received death threats after José Mourinho, then Chelsea’s manager, accused him of favouring Barcelona in a Champions League game. And in May this year, a match between two London amateur teams ended with the referee being chased around the pitch, knocked down and kicked by players and spectators. Just days ago, a linesman in a game between Rangers and Livingston had his head cut open by an object thrown from the crowd. Douglas Ross sits at the intersection of Britain’s two most hated jobs: he is a match day official and a politician. In May this year, the Conservative MP for Moray and FA-certified linesman delighted fans on both sides of the stadium when he fell flat on his face during the Scottish Cup final. In March, when he called for Celtic’s Jozo Simunovic to be sent off during a Rangers v Celtic game, Twitter lit up with accusations that Ross was not just a cheat, but a Unionist cheat.It is a warm day when I meet Ross – just back in London after a summer spent touring his constituency and running the line in qualifying matches for European club tournaments – on the terrace of the Commons. Implausibly, somewhere nearby a bagpiper is playing.“I was on my way home and the observer rang,” says Ross, 35, remembering the aftermath of that Old Firm match. (Top-level referees and assistants are watched in every game.) “I thought: ‘This can’t be good – he said he’d phone tomorrow.’ But his wife had been on Facebook and seen all the stuff about me, so he wanted to warn me. I did stay off social media for a while.”But just as the public rage was dying down, it was stirred up again in parliament by Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader in Westminster. “The game was on the Sunday. On the Tuesday, we had the spring statement and he stood up and said, ‘We all saw the honourable member for Moray waving his flag furiously at Ibrox, getting a Celtic player red carded. Well, maybe he should take the red card out and show it to the chancellor of the exchequer because his statement is so terrible.’“He thought that was a funny remark. I thought it was a cheap gag. What it did was reignite all those people on social media who had just calmed down after 48 hours of having a go at me. Sometimes my opponents don’t realise the implications.”Why do referees do it? Because they love football, of course. Sometimes it’s also because they weren’t good enough as players: “One of my old managers told me I’d be a good referee,” remembers Premier League referee Chris Kavanagh, “which was his way of saying my playing days were over.” Sometimes it’s because they want to see a different side of the game: Abdulkadir Arshe, the ref who got me running the line in Regent’s Park, was a youth team coach – he remembers with horror telling referees they didn’t know what they were doing – and took the FA course after reffing a few casual games. Sometimes it’s a way of prolonging the experience of being at the top of football: 38-year-old Cheryl Foster played 63 times for Wales, more than any other female player, and spent nine years with Liverpool. When she retired from playing, she wanted to stay in the game and is now on the Fifa list, eligible to referee the biggest matches in the women’s game in August she became the first woman to take charge of a men’s Welsh Premier League game. The rest of the time, she’s a PE teacher and deputy head school will take priority until the October half-term.“As a player, you think you know quite a lot about the game,” she says. “And you do. But as a referee you learn lots more little things. Mainly positioning. As a striker I stayed in one part of the pitch, whereas a referee has to be like a box-to-box midfielder. I do more fitness work now than when I was a player – in the last five weeks I’ve been fitness tested five times.” As a Fifa referee, she is sent stringent targets and a training programme (“which I follow religiously”).She passed her test in December 2013 and the next month was an assistant referee in the men’s Welsh National League – a demanding start. “It was the physical nature I noticed,” she says. In women’s football, “the ball is played and passed a lot more” male players clattered into whoever was in possession.Foster referees the way she would have wanted to be refereed. “I talk to players as much as I can and explain decisions. If I haven’t seen something, I’ll say so, calmly. I even smile. I don’t want to seem unapproachable – I’ve been on the receiving end, especially from male referees. You’d ask a question and get a hand gesture – ‘Stay away, I’m not talking.’ It adds to the frustration.”The first steps into refereeing can be terrifying. First, there’s the prospect of having to manage people. Second, the sense of responsibility – that a mistake can sway the destiny of a game. Third, the simple fear of retribution. At Ross’s first game – an under-13s match – he let play go ahead despite the pitch being dangerously frozen, then forgot what he had learned and baffled players by giving rugby signals. Ryan Atkin, 33, who referees at National League level (one step below the Football League), forgot to bring his whistle to his first match in a Devon league. “The first half of the game was reffed with me using my voice,” he says. “My grandfather found me a whistle for the second half.“Until you’re experienced, it’s scary,” Atkin says of those first few times in charge. “That’s especially true in parks football, which can be very lonely. You’re often on your own, potentially managing 30 players and coaches, who might not appreciate what you’re doing and the number of decisions you make.”Ross says a lot of officials are lost at this level, “because they get so much abuse from their very first game. These are people just starting out, but because of the reaction of some coaches and parents, they just walk away.”In the parks, there are things you can’t prepare for. Ashley Hickson-Lovence qualified as a referee at 16, and after a bad tackle in a south London league game two years later, found the teams confronting each other not with the usual pushing and shoving – what commentators call “handbags” – but with knives. “Someone was stabbed in the face. It went into the car park. I ran for cover and called the police, who got there in four minutes. I had to downplay that to my family – my mum had never been keen on me refereeing.” Reflecting on the fight now, Hickson-Lovence has a very refereeish reaction: “I think I learned a lesson.” That it’s worth checking how well-armed teams are? “That I was too inclined to let games flow.” If he’d clamped down on the tackles, he thinks, no one would have felt the need for knives. Nine years later he is still refereeing, and writing a PhD on the early life of the English ref Uriah Rennie.There are 28,000 FA-qualified referees in England (Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own football associations), overseeing every FA-recognised game of football in the country, from Premier to kids in the park. In England, you take a 34-hour course, mixing classroom and on-pitch learning, to become a level seven referee, taking charge of amateur games. If you are good, your local FA and league administrators will notice you and you’ll get promoted. By level four, you’ll referee semi-professional leagues, controlling games in front of paying crowds – small crowds, but crowds nonetheless, who feel they have a right to let you know what they think. At level one, you referee in the Premier and Football Leagues, and your mistakes will be featured on TV and the sports pages. At all levels, you will get insulted on Twitter.On average, between 4,000 and 5,500 new referees qualify each year, paying about £160 to take the course. With 28,000 in total, you don’t need a maths degree to work out most of these new recruits don’t last the distance. But the FA’s senior referee officer, Farai Hallam, says the number of working referees is “healthy”. Every county FA has its own development officer to offer advice, and all new referees get a mentor. The FA is trying to change the face of refereeing, he says, recruiting more women and people from ethnic minorities. “Football evolves,” he says, “and refereeing has to evolve as well.”In that context, Ryan Atkin’s decision to come out last year, becoming the English game’s first openly gay referee, was a big deal. The announcement was coordinated between him, the FA, Stonewall, Sky Sports and Professional Match Game Officials Ltd (the company responsible for officials). “We discussed why I was doing it, and they couldn’t have been more supportive. We’ve seen an encouraging increase in people in sport coming forward since then. I think in the next couple of years the game will become more inclusive.”You might expect the top levels of the game to be the hardest to run: there is so much more at stake the crowds are vast the scrutiny is intense. But the roar of a stadium full of people can be too loud for any inidual insult to matter. “The crowd is just background noise in the Premier League,” Kavanagh says. “We’re so focused on talking to each other” – officials wear earpieces and microphones – “and working as a team, we only pick up a little.”Top-class officials stay in a hotel together before the match, travel together to and from the stadium (imposed after a referee driving home from a West Ham game was accosted by angry fans at traffic lights) and often work in the same groups. In fact, the camaraderie is one of the things referees love about the game. Down in the local park, there’s none of that support.But the bigger difference comes in the standard of play. Top-level teams are not interested in anything that gets in the way of winning, and moaning at the ref isn’t a priority, regardless of what TV pictures suggest. This is not always the case lower down the leagues, particularly where amateur and semi-professional football merges. There also tend to be just enough people watching – maybe 50 or 60 – to make everything they say to the officials very audible, and potentially hurtful.This is where officials get the worst abuse, Ross says. “I’ve sent lower-league players off for calling me a cheat. That’s the worst thing you can say, questioning an official’s integrity. Yes, we’ll get things wrong, and some officials might be incompetent, but we never go out there and think that if we do such and such, a team will win.”All referees have their own style. Some are martinets some allow players as much leeway as possible. What unites them is horror at their own mistakes. “It makes you feel sick,” Atkin says. He mentions a game where he got a couple of huge decisions wrong. “I can’t watch that clip,” he says. “You feel angry at yourself, embarrassed. There’s the fear of going back to the club in a couple of months and having to walk in and smile. You want to talk about it – but you don’t want to remind them you made that decision.”I ask what the game was. Atkin says he’s so ashamed, he has wiped the teams’ names from his mind. “But if you go on YouTube and search ‘Ryan Atkin referee’ it’s there.” I do. It’s Staines Town v Welling United in 2013, and he’s right, his decisions are horrible: a scything tackle is ignored a striker who’s blatantly pushed over gets booked for ing.Ross says he obsesses about every borderline call. “I’ll watch them 100 times on TV – my wife gets so fed up with it. I can’t sleep on a Saturday night if I think I’ve got something wrong. Not only have you affected a match, but all your colleagues will see it and the press and pundits will tear you to shreds.”Yet the vast majority of decisions in every match are correct: at the very top of the game, barely one in a hundred will be wrong. When an official does make a mistake, the Premier League referees will discuss it at their fortnightly seminars and work out how to avoid repeating it.It’s the same down the leagues. But while the official close to the incident is better placed than the bloke 90 yards away with half an eye on his phone, still the officials get the blame for almost everything. “Sometimes players don’t want to work with you,” Atkin says. “The challenges fly in, but you’re the one getting flak for not controlling the game. Well, what have I done to make you tackle like that? With those games, you can’t wait for the 90 minutes to end.”Still, every official I speak to stresses how much they enjoy it. They talk of how fit it makes them (Arshe, who referees six games every weekend, says he averages 30,000 steps every match day), of the satisfaction of getting through difficult games and the bond that develops between officials. They walk on to the pitch together, and off the pitch together, always with their heads held high – even on those occasions when they need a police escort.After what seems like an eternity, my 80 minutes running the line in Regent’s Park are over. My son’s team lost 8-1. I am cold and wet and cringing at the memory of completely misreading one situation, raising my flag to a player who was miles onside. “I’m sorry!” I shouted. “I got that wrong.” The players, less than a third my age, roll their eyes in disgust. They turn to the referee: “He admitted he got that wrong!” one of them shouts. “Come on, ref!”At the end of the game, I’m left out of the handshakes. No one says, “Thanks for the game, lino”, not even my own son.That afternoon, I go to Loftus Road to watch QPR play Norwich. I sit in my usual seat in the front row of the West Paddock, within easy shouting distance of the assistant referee. Around me come the usual shouts. “Oi, lino, help your fucking mate out, will you? He’s shit.” “Oi, lino, your hair get in your eyes? How come you didn’t see that?” “Oi, lino, don’t you know the fucking rules?”I sit in silence. There’s no way I’m ever criticising a referee again. At least, not until the next time.• Commenting on this piece?

There cannot really have been much of a crisis at Manchester United if a single last-gasp win over a team in the bottom three has made everything hunky dory again, though once the uneasy international break truce is over the matter will be put to the test at the weekend.United’s next three opponents are Chelsea, Juventus and Everton, a bit more of a challenge than Wolves, Derby and Newcastle, and it is not inconceivable based on recent form that they might struggle to win any of those games. The manager had the bright idea in the narrow 3-2 victory against Newcastle of pulling Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic back to operate alongside Chris Smalling because – stop me if you have heard this one before – United do not possess any central defenders of sufficient quality to play the ball out from the back.Ed Woodward must certainly be weary of Mourinho trotting out that line by now and the executive vice‑chairman is probably just as tired of countering that two of the central defenders the manager considers incapable – Eric Bailly and Victor Lindeløf – were brought to the club at no little expense by the Lowry hotel’s most famous resident.Despite the prolonged sulk over the club’s failure to buy Harry Maguire or Toby Alderweireld in summer. Mourinho made his point very well against Newcastle, Pogba and Matic driving forward through midfield in the second half changed the game, though what worked against a retreating Jonjo Shelvey and Mo Diamé will not necessarily cut it against Chelsea or Juventus. Both of those sides are strong in midfield and both have attacking players who would be delighted to find themselves up against a side electing to play with Smalling as the only recognised central defender.One imagines Mourinho will resort to smothering defensive tactics on his return to Stamford Bridge in any case – that seems to be his default setting for games against dangerous opponents – though the home game against Juventus might be trickier. Mourinho’s rather feeble boast about having more points than any other English team in Europe last weekend was predicated on a comfortable win over Young Boys of Switzerland, not quite the standard of opposition Liverpool, Spurs and Manchester City found themselves facing when suffering Champions League defeats. Valencia get to play the Swiss side, so unless United are able to take points from the perennial Italian champions Group H may soon be looking a little less comforting.In all probability, the trip to Chelsea will set the tone for the rest of the week, both in terms of United’s top-four aspirations, if they still have any, and Mourinho’s tense relationship with the club’s hierarchy and wider public. Chelsea are still unbeaten in all competitions, the last English club remaining unconquered, and though that might have something to do with playing in the Europa rather than the Champions League it still amounts to a terrific start for a new coach in a new country.Maurizio Sarri seems to be getting more out of Eden Hazard than Mourinho used to manage too, the Belgian is playing with a new freedom and is unquestionably the stand‑out player in the Premier League at the moment, if not Europe. Comparisons are invidious but inevitable when Mourinho takes a team to Chelsea and costly signings such as Pogba and Romelu Lukaku will be aware they have some catching up to do.Should the subject of the former’s interest in a move to Barcelona surface again as the transfer window approaches, United supporters would be entitled to feel particularly short-changed whatever financial recompense ends up being proposed. Pogba’s career since rejoining United has been one distraction after another, with explosiveness being mostly confined to the back pages rather than the pitch. Hazard, on the other hand, has furthered his ambition of joining Real Madrid by playing to his full potential and reaching the level of unignorable talent his backers always felt was within his grasp. Chelsea will do well to keep him, assuming they believe they will be able to keep him, though they know the facts of football life and Hazard will not be allowed to go cheaply if he make his expected switch in summer.Should this turn out to be Hazard’s last season in London, in other words, no one can complain about the value he is currently providing and the contrast with Pogba’s handling of his affairs at United would be stark. Chelsea fans would hardly begrudge their best player his dream move, especially if he can make his valedictory campaign in England a memorable one.That seems entirely possible, Hazard is in the form of his life and Chelsea under Sarri are already playing consistently well enough to be regarded as title contenders, which is something else that will probably irk their former manager. Sympathy for Mourinho is possible, however. It must be a hell of a job organising inferior defenders when you have to face Hazard and Cristiano Ronaldo in the space of four days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f6747268b262fe04eff6b08876b16b43fac8f57/180_259_2672_1603/master/2672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cce32b1eab85ec7d17b821e6d55f18a1","title":"league one two non league day clockwatch live","story":"Elsewhere in League One, Accrington are now 3-1 up against Bradford, Shrewsbury have pulled one back at Fleetwood, Doncaster now lead 3-1 at Rochdale, it’s 2-0 to Peterborough at Scunthorpe.

One game is underway already, it’s still 0-0 between Northampton and unbeaten Forest Green at Sixfields. Here is the full League Two slate:Here are all today’s fixtures in third tier:With no action in England’s top two tiers and the national team having bored fans to tears in Croatia on Friday night it turns to the lesser-heralded talents to entertain the football-watching public. There is a full slate of fixtures in League One and League Two, as well as the annual Non-League Day jamboree.At the top of League One, Portsmouth head to Wimbledon a week on from losing their first league game of the season - a shock home defeat by Gillingham. Kenny Jackett’s side bounced back in their midweek EFL Trophy tie at Crawley and will want to maintain their three point gap over second-place Peterborough. The Posh are on the road at mid-table Scunthorpe. Down the bottom, Oxford host Plymouth. Of the two Argyle are the ‘form’ side, going into the game unbeaten in two and travelling to the Kassam off the back their first win of the season over the Dons last week.In League Two, Macclesfield continued their miserable run on Friday night with a 1-0 defeat at Tranmere. Elsewhere, Forest Green Rovers are the last remaining unbeaten side in the Football League, Mark Cooper takes his team head to Northampton hopeful of maintaining that proud record. On Non-League Day we have picked out a few games to keep an eye on. The glamour fixture is at the top of the National League as second-place Leyton Orient host Hartlepool, who sit sixth. Down a tier, we have surely the longest trip of the day as Hemel Hempstead make a near four-hour journey to play Truro City in Torquay, on a similar theme Blyth Spartans travel the long road to Boston. In the Isthmian League Premier Division, new joint managers Nicky Shorey and Glen Little take charge of their first game at the helm of Wingate \u0026amp Finchley against Leatherhead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e57b2835569a1de5c8b6062ff923f2aa6a097767/0_346_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c70ceafe74b7aef4e2910d4a9e5fc2d8","title":"tips on how to improve concentration focus","story":"Even the smartest people sometimes struggle to stay in the zone. What tricks do they use to get back on track?Most of the essentials of my job come down to concentration and focus. It is not a matter of memory, but of how best to use and deploy what one has remembered. That is true if, for example, you are marking a student’s essay. It is not a question of seeing what they get wrong or right (my subject isn’t really about that, others may be). It is about seeing what the student was trying to argue, and how they could make it better and more convincing. That sounds simple, but it requires a hell of a lot of thought. The same is true of lecturing, or writing the chapter of a book. It is all about how you can use what you know to make the most powerful case, to engage people’s interest, or to show why what you want to say is important.When it comes to techniques that help me focus, the flip answer is “one glass of wine but not two”. It’s flip, but there is a point there. Sometimes concentration is helped by loosening up a bit (though not too much). Sometimes it is helped by taking a break. I am not advocating laziness. But it takes a very long time to learn that simply ploughing on, hour after hour, isn’t the most productive thing to do (as I always tell my students, more marks are lost in exams by being tired than by not knowing enough). And you have to keep your intellectual interest up. You won’t remember ideas effectively if you are not actually interested in them.The most important lesson I have learned when it comes to writing or conveying difficult ideas is this: if you sit all morning and find yourself having repeated attempts to crystallise something and it never works, and you just hit the delete button again and again, the problem is probably a bigger one. It’s not that you can’t crystallise it on paper, it’s that you haven’t really worked out what you want to say. Why it never works is because you haven’t yet mastered the question. So it’s time to go back to the drawing board.I find that just before giving any talk at an event I declare to myself how it’s going to go. Much like when we go to a party and we decide beforehand that it’s going to be rubbish – and it is. We can also decide it’s going to be great. That’s the power of words. We get to say how our life goes.I was giving a TedxTalk at the Royal Albert Hall in front of 4,500 people, just me on stage with a memorised eight-minute piece to say on how wordplay can bring people together.Twenty minutes before I was due to go on, I got lost in the corridors behind the stage while trying to find the loos and I just about found my way back to the green room. Then there was a problem with my microphone getting clipped on my back-stage pass, which I was trying to bite through with my teeth to release. With moments to go, my wife looked at me as if to say: “You look scared.”She was right. As soon as I realised what my face looked like, that was an opportunity to stop being so significant! As soon as we realise something doesn’t really matter in the great scheme of things, we can relax. I said to myself: “This is going to be fun,” and stepped on to the stage.Regarding elements of my work and concentration, I find playing short-term games works. For example, if I have 30 clues to write in a puzzle, I might plan to do six every hour. I can even set an alarm to give me a five-minute warning. Am I winning? Am I losing? If I lose, I could always win the next game … It’s fun. I sometimes run marathons too. My second London Marathon was the worst experience. I was thinking of the finish from mile one. And it seemed a long, long way! Playing 26 games to the mileposts was much more fun on the next marathons.The major test for playing good poker is to be as rational as possible. So emotions are generally the worst thing for a poker player. Whether it’s fear, excitement or anger, they all cloud your judgment because they make you motivated to come to a decision, rather than realise the truth of the situation. You’re trying to be a judge, evaluating all these bits of evidence, but if you let your emotions get in the way, you’ll start to look for things that might not be there for example, thinking another player might be bluffing, rather than pinpointing the objective truth. Emotions can be helpful in inspiring us to want to be better, but for in-game decision-making you want to find a way to master them and keep a cool a head.Imagine being in a big tournament. You start off with a 1,000 chips, you lose a big hand and you’re down to 500. Another player jumps up from 250 chips to 500. You’ll both be in a very different mindset even though you both have the same number of chips. So you need to find a way to mentally detach yourself from things that have happened historically that might make you emotionally upset.I was really tested in this way on the major final table at the European poker tour. I had the commanding chip lead, lost a hand badly and mentally just went to pieces. I remember having this very angry dialogue in my head – it felt like a weird injustice. I had to recognise that I was in this emotional state – which is often the hardest part – but as soon as I realised, I could address it. I told myself: “This is really important, and not the time to focus on past errors.” I took a moment to breathe and did a little gratitude thing, telling myself how lucky I am right now to be in this situation. Then I did a big picture gratitude thing – telling myself I should to be grateful I was born in the 1980s rather than the 1600s when everyone was dying of anything – that kind of thing.I found it a really good way to get some instant perspective. Anything like that will just get you out of that emotional state and back to your objective. And ... I ended up winning. It’s a very low cost thing to try, even if it doesn’t work out you might have a moment when you feel better about the situation.In general, if I know that I have something important coming up, the most powerful thing I can do is a bit of meditation. Even a walk in the park where you stand barefoot – I find it makes you feel really present, just standing like a weirdo in the park for 10 minutes, focusing on your breath. That really sets you up well for the day, whether it’s playing poker, or anything else.Learning lines is a bore, period. For me, on stage, physicality helps. So the lines are in my body as well. When learning for a play, I tell myself I have to know these lines by such and such time. Or that I’ll get to page 20 by the end of the week, page 40 by the second week … I give myself a framework and a goal. I remember, years ago, someone telling me to put the script under my pillow. That may be a myth, but I do think learning last thing at night and first thing in the morning works. I’d say my concentration is good but my memory less good. I take a supplement called gingko biloba and I take lecithin. I think those supplements help too.It’s important to make the distinction between learning for the long term, for a play, and cramming for the short term like actors do for film and television. There’s a subtle difference, but for a play you really have to get it in you. And it’s not improvisational you have to say what’s on the page. You have to be accurate.With live theatre, there’s always the possibility that you’re going to go blank. And it’s really, really frightening. Once I was performing in the Cherry Orchard at the National Theatre and I had a speech. I knew it, I’d done it a million times, but I said the first two lines and just went blank. I didn’t have a clue what I was going to say. There was this long, long pause, it was horrific, I wanted to die in that moment, you’re so exposed. Eventually I said, in character: “What do I say? What do I say?” and it came back to me. In those few minutes the whole speech was just flashing through my brain. I did get back on track, but it was horrible. I don’t know why it happened.Memory can be just so mysterious. My godfather had a photographic memory and total recall. I remember my mother saying it was the freakiest thing, the first time he visited London – he’d just looked at a few maps and knew his way round better than she did, and she lived there.But I do believe the part of your mind that works for memory is like a muscle and the more you work it, the better it becomes.My job is quite varied as an academic. I could be writing a computer program, reading long, detailed mathematical research papers or conducting my own research. One of my most complex challenges was working on a European Space Agency mission to plan a satellite that could make more accurate forecasts for space weather. It required having to think of lots of new things at the same time without immediately knowing what the path is to work out the answers to the questions we were facing.I’m quite keen on physical space to give me mental space. That’s reflected in the place I work. I work at the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory. It’s in a Victorian mansion in the Surrey hills, so we’ve got an awful lot of countryside around us and the property sits in grounds with many acres. I have a view of the South Downs. I like the feeling of open physical space and not feeling constrained, which helps me focus. At home, I work in the biggest room with the most light, so I don’t feel boxed in.I tend to listen to baroque music when I work. I like ordered, very definite beats in the music I listen to. That can create a soundscape that stops me getting distracted by other noises. I’m not motivated by having a particular composer or piece of music, I want it to be a barrier that surrounds me and stops the distractions of the outside world coming in. There’s something useful about having unfamiliar music so it doesn’t draw too much of your attention.What really tests me on a daily basis are the anomalies which the public throw at you. Many passengers get areas and road names confused. They may use colloquial names or aren’t even entirely sure of their destination, having only a vague description to go on. In such cases a lot of focus is required in order to ensure your fare ends up at the correct place.But learning the Knowledge tested my ability to focus more than anything. You’re assessed in a series of one-on-one verbal exams I had to endure 27 of them. Now and then an examiner will prod your temperament and so, while answering questions, they’ll try and throw you. In my own experience this involved, among other things, having a book hurled across the room while I was speaking. They play quite a few other psychological tricks, too. When you finally become a cabbie, you quickly realise that the Knowledge examiners were in fact providing a simulation of sorts, preparing you for a career which is often spent thinking under pressure.There are quite a few techniques trainee cabbies use. For me, the most practical trick was to employ acronyms and mnemonics – the most famous example being Little Apples Grow Quickly Please that helps recall the order of theatres on Shaftesbury Avenue (Lyric, Apollo, Gielgud, Queen’s, Palace). Very useful when you are struggling to pinpoint a place on a gloomy autumn evening. I’ve found the skills from the Knowledge have really helped when travelling abroad. As well as providing me with the tools to latch on to local maps and landmarks, the memory techniques I’ve acquired also provide a real boost when learning key phrases in a different language."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/980436e5e9f1eea9c3624d34e54c245db1daf05b/0_1155_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f766009d19687900153f79ae0b11b42d","title":"easy feasting spanish spiced roast rack of pork","story":"Smoked paprika and aromatic fennel add fire and flavour to a roasted rack of pork that’s low on effort, high on impact and perfect for sharingOutdoor late summer gatherings don’t always have to mean firing up the barbecue.

It’s a sunny midweek afternoon in August, and journalist Adegoke and marketing specialist Uviebinené are doing what they so often do – thrashing out plans for their next business move over a bite to eat and a glass of wine. The venue is stylish wine bar and eatery Sapling on Dalston’s Kingsland Road and they’re joined by one of the many women they collaborated with for the book – Anne-Marie Imafidon. She’s co-founder of Stemettes, a social enterprise that inspires young women to progress in the science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) industries. The hot topic of conversation is the merits of creative collaboration.Uviebinené and Adegoke first met as freshers at Warwick University and bonded after noticing how few other black women there were on campus. Five years later, out of university and straight into the workplace, the issues of representation that first brought them together were more prominent than ever. It was after one particularly frustrating morning that Uviebinené rang Adegoke and suggested she write about their experiences. Adegoke replied with an emphatic “yes” and then an equally emphatic “but let’s do it together”.This signalled the start of a creative collaboration between the best friends, a mode of working that they both believe has been the secret ingredient to the resulting book’s success. For the two first-time authors with no publishing experience or connections to the industry, it was the decision to do it together that gave them the confidence to jump headfirst into the project. “Because there were two of us and we really believed in each other, the book went from being the twinkle of an idea to a physical proposal very easily,” Adegoke explains. “Doing it together meant we could constantly encourage each other.”Living together as they collaborated on the book meant that any time outside of their working schedules could be dedicated to dreaming up ideas for the project. Naturally, shared mealtimes became the optimum place to debrief on anything new. The pair definitely used to bond over food, Adegoke says, describing the “delicious, unusual” dishes Uviebinené would make for her: “Things like jerk salmon, pasta and seafood.” Often, friends would drop by and they’d enjoy a Thai feast and a bottle of wine. “Eating and debriefing is very much a highlight of my week,” Adegoke adds, “no-one’s ever too busy for a good meal, and it’s one of the few times in a week I can properly find out what everyone’s up to.”Beyond their own friendship group, the pair reached out to other women they knew to get involved, for help with everything from focus groups to photo shoots. Ideas were tried and tested over informal social settings, very often over food and wine. “A meeting room would feel too serious,” Uviebinené explains. “You eat, you relax and ultimately you let your guard down,” she says. “Dinner parties are always interesting, because a lot of friends have ‘side-hustles’ that they’re trying to get off the ground alongside their nine-to-five jobs. There are always a lot of ideas being bounced around over food and wine and lots of words of encouragement and advice.”The importance of women encouraging and supporting other women is critical now more than ever and Adegoke is refreshingly straight-talking on the topic. “We live in a world where most things work against women,” she says, “and on another level they work against women of colour, so it’s incredibly important for us to be there for each other.”Imafidon agrees, in her role at Stemettes she’s working to get women interested in fields too often focused towards male students. “There’s this saying: ‘You can’t be what you can’t see,’” she says. “I think it’s really important to set up environments where girls can see all the possibilities, and beyond them.”Between breaking open new industries and breaking bread with your trusted support network, collaborating on ideas and sharing advice is clearly on the menu for an increasingly social group of creative women.Made for sharingFrom delicious food and wine to music, art and words of wisdom, Campo Viejo believes that life’s better shared. This ethos dates back to Campo Viejo’s earliest days in Rioja. In an era when the people of Spain only drank wine from their region, the founders of Campo Viejo wanted to share their Rioja not only with the people of the next village, but with the people of the next town, the rest of the Spain and ultimately the world. Their vision was that the wine they created would bring people together for years to come.Campo Viejo. Made for sharing.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes. It won’t be any worse for it.Best paired with …With its crisp, fresh flavours, white fruit aromas and delicate stream of bubbles, a glass of perfectly chilled Cava Brut Reserva makes an ideal accompaniment to the sharply-sweet flavours of rhubarb charlotte.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

But, as a result of being “cheated” out of her full basic state pension by the UK government, the 93-year-old has been left so hard-up she has to think twice about going to the supermarket or buying Christmas presents for her grandchildren.Meanwhile, at 87, widower Alan Job has been forced to find paid work – because, he says, the government’s decision to freeze his state pension means he is now unable to meet his normal living expenses.He has been offered a 20-hours-a-week position with an animal charity.Puckridge and Job are just two of about 550,000 Britons living overseas losing out as a result of the UK’s “frozen pensions” policy. Their basic state pensions don’t increase every year, as in the UK – they are permanently frozen at the date the inidual retired or arrived in their country of residence.Puckridge’s daughter Gillian Mittins started a petition on the Change.org website to highlight their plight – and has seen it take off dramatically. At one point her petition was notching up roughly 100 signatures a minute and, as of Friday lunchtime, had been signed by about 175,000 people. Mittins says her mother has been “punished” by the British government for deciding, at the age of 76, to move to Canada to be close to her family. If she had stayed in the UK, she would be receiving up to £125.95 a week (the full UK basic state pension). Instead, it is frozen at the 2001 level of £72.50.“This is despite the fact that by living overseas, she is saving the British government thousands of pounds each year in medical costs, bus passes, social services and other benefits,” says Mittins. Money has calculated that the total amount Puckridge has missed out on between 2001 and now is more than £22,000.Campaigners say cases like this highlight the unfairness of the UK policy. There are more than 100 countries worldwide where the UK basic state pension is not “uprated” each year, including Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand.If you move to one of them, your UK pension will be permanently frozen at the date you retire, or when you arrived, no matter how rich or poor you are, what job you did, or how much national insurance you have paid.But if you move to an EU country, the US, or one of a seemingly random list of places, including Macedonia and Samoa, your state pension increases in line with inflation.The policy has been in place for decades, and ministers have conceded the rules are “illogical”. However, they argue it would be too expensive to uprate those affected, and that the priority should be targeting money at the poorest pensioners at home.Ministers have estimated that to fully uprate everyone’s frozen pensions to current levels would cost more than £500m a year. However, campaigners say that so-called “partial uprating” would involve a much lower upfront cost: £37m.Puckridge served with the Women’s Royal Naval Service (the Wrens) during the war, after which she returned to the UK and brought up her family, working in administrative jobs and, later, as a lecturer in Stroud, Gloucestershire. At retirement age she continued to work part-time until 76, when she relocated to Canada to be closer to her daughter and grandchildren.“My mother served her country, then she spent the rest of her working life paying national insurance. She expected, like the rest of us, that when it was time to retire, she would be able to access the pension she had paid into,” says Mittins.She adds that many vulnerable overseas pensioners have been forced to return to the UK, leaving their family behind, because they can no longer cope with the real value of their pension being eroded. “Please sign this petition, for my mum and for all the other overseas pensioners who are being cheated by the British government,” is Mittins’s plea.Meanwhile, Alan Job and his family relocated from Birmingham to South Africa in 1972. Their eldest daughter suffered from asthma, so they thought a change of climate would help.It did, so they stayed, but they maintained their British citizenship and continued paying into the UK state pension. At 65, Job started drawing it. He received £63.60 a week, while his wife – who died in March this year aged 87 – received £44.99. “Our pensions remained the same in pounds, with not one penny extra for the 22 years,” says Job, who lives in Durban.When he notified the British pensions authority of his wife’s death her pension was cancelled but he was told his would be upgraded. “Imagine my surprise, shock and disgust when I found my increase was just £8.18 per week,” he says. “Is that all they think my wife of 57 years was worth? Myour joint pension has dropped by £36.81 a week. As a result, I was unable to meet my normal living expenses, and have had to seek employment. How many 87-year-old pensioners in Britain, or ‘unfrozen’ countries, have had to do that?”He will earn the equivalent of about £40 a week at the charity.The Department for Work and Pensions has previously said that overseas recipients of the basic state pension will only get a yearly increase if they live in the European Economic Area (EEA), Gibraltar or Switzerland, or in a country with a reciprocal agreement with the UK that allows this to happen.Find out more about the campaign at endfrozenpensions.org• April 2002: “Heat’s on for pension freeze...

The death of her mother Monica in 2009 floored the musician, something she wrote about on her 2014 album Blank Project (“Since our mother’s gone, it always seems to rain,” she sang on Across the Water) and earlier this year she also lost Judy Blame, the stylist and close friend who was instrumental in her image and helped to create 1989’s iconic Raw Like Sushi cover.While another loss might have made for an impossible situation, Cherry arrives and is happy to talk. She has a kind of wise Buddha vibe at the best of times, so a life-changing moment only makes her seem more sage-like. Broken Politics is a sparse, unguarded record. As with Blank Project, it was co-written with Kieran Hebden, better known as the producer Four Tet, and Cherry’s lifelong collaborator and partner Cameron McVey. The record moves its focus from the internal demons of Blank Project to the hopeless state of the world and a renewed resolution to do something about it. Its lyrics reference the refugee crisis (she volunteered at the Calais migrant camp), increased violence in cities and the rise of the far right in Cherry’s home country of Sweden (she says she thinks young men are voting for the far-right Swedish Democrats because they mistakenly think it an act of rebellion). Does making political music feel like the right response in a time of crisis? “Music is the only weapon I carry,” she says. “Sometimes the political begins with self-examination.”While that may sound a little slam-poetry when written down, it doesn’t when she says it. Whether that’s from a lifetime spent being creative or the rawness of her current situation, Cherry doesn’t do cynicism or small talk the agenda is exclusively important things.Where was she when she found out about her dad? “My sister was with me in my house in west London we were together, thank God. I was saying to her: ‘We’re different now than what we were this morning. We woke up and we didn’t know where this day was going to take us.’”Cherry has not talked much about her father before. Her stepfather Don Cherry, the jazz musician, has always played a more prominent role both in her life and her musical narrative. But she says she met her biological father, Ahmadu Jah, when she was around eight years old and that he had a major impact.He was born “really in the bush” of Sierra Leone, she says, before moving to the US, the UK and eventually Sweden. Within a week of arriving, he met Cherry’s mother. “He brought a lot of records with him, introduced her to a lot of music and he taught her how to cook.”Cherry says that the first time she met him, it was overwhelming, “because he was so happy to have me around and I think maybe also slightly guilty. In the beginning, perhaps I was a bit confused by how much he loved me and the bond between us.”That relationship with her father forms just one part of a childhood unlike any other. In the early 1970s, mother Monica and stepfather Don bought a 19th-century schoolhouse in southern Sweden. They wanted to make, not a commune exactly, but “a place people could come and do things together, where they were going to bring us up”.However, that kind of unconventional upbringing brought with it some unsettling moments. “One summer, there was just like 15 women who were all in the process of leaving their husbands,” she recalls. “One woman had a nervous breakdown and took all of our pots and pans and hung them in the trees.”Did she ever think that a normal life would have been preferable? “I’m sure when I was younger, and I wanted to be like the other kids around me. But I don’t feel like that now,” she says. “I was looking at my father the other day in the hospital and thinking: wow, that journey that he made, coming to Sweden in the early 60s and making a life there, learning the language, fighting to be accepted, it’s a big thing he did. Imagine when he went out in the street in the light of day, there’s no black people there.” By comparison, she says, an unusual but loving childhood surrounded by an extended family is not so hard.In her teens, she moved away from the house, flitting between New York City, Stockholm and London. It was in those nomadic years that Cherry earned her chops in the UK post-punk scene, playing in Rip Rig + Panic and an iteration of the Slits (she lived with the band’s Ari Up in a squat in Battersea). By her early 20s, she was regularly being touted as the new Madonna. She had been signed to Virgin as a solo artist and produced one of the great musical crossover albums, Raw Like Sushi, a melding of punk, hip-hop and pop that was light years ahead of its time and from which TV shows and films are still nicking tracks, such is its perennial coolness. Cherry wrote much of the record with McVey, who would become her husband. In between its release and her winning best international breakthrough and best international solo artist at the 1990 Brit awards, she gave birth to her second daughter Tyson, famously performing on Top of the Pops while heavily pregnant.But the life of a pop star did not fit with Cherry. The music industry was still entirely dominated by white men and, in the US in particular, there was a seedier side. “When Buffalo Stance came out in the States we were going around doing PR and I spoke to my promotions guy,” she says, “and it was just common knowledge that you go to the radio stations and just pay the heads with coke and hookers to get them to play a record. I did a certain amount of … not that, but ringing around to radio guys and talking to them about their new car, new babies or, you know, ass-licking on that level. I was out one night in New York with this pretty well-known guy and we were meeting the heads of some radio station and he was like: ‘Well if you just kinda give them what they want they’d probably give the record the thumbs up,’ insinuating that maybe if I went into a cupboard with them or something … And I was like: ‘I’m gonna go now, this is too much.’”She ended up having a musical life but one less focused on ego. She didn’t like being manhandled by other figures. She released two further albums in the 90s but they swung away from pop, exploring the further reaches of world music and trip-hop. She melted down a Brit award and turned it into jewellery. And, just like her parents’ house, her home became a creative commune: Massive Attack recorded much of Blue Lines in her baby’s bedroom.Then, as her children got older, Cherry started slowly making music again. In 2012 she released an album of mostly covers with the Thing, in 2013 a collaborative record with RocketNumberNine called MeYouWeYou, and then, in 2014, she finally felt ready to release a record under her own name.I ask whether she sees the two parts of her career as joined up – is the Neneh Cherry who made Raw Like Sushi even related to the one making these mature, world weary-sounding records? “To me it’s all connected,” she says. “I feel that more and more everything is riding on the same spine or umbilical cord and without one thing you don’t go to the other. When I listen to the sounds of the new album, I can hear those rooms that I grew up in, the music that was being made around me when I was a child.”She says a major part of that spine is McVey, whom she has been with for 30 years. “I still feel like there’s more to it. I know that we’re not done and that’s really interesting,” she says. “We’re still getting to know each other but he definitely knows my digits, you know what I mean? I think it’s a treasure to have relationships for life.”In the time she’s been making music, Cherry’s body of work has also grown in appreciation. Interestingly, Pitchfork recently published a new version of its best albums of the 1980s. The original list made in 2002, it said, demonstrated a “lack of ersity” both in its critics and their choices. Raw Like Sushi did not make the cut on the first list, but did on the 2018 version. Does she think that, as a mixed-race female artist, she has got short thrift from white male critics? “It’s interesting about Pitchfork, it’s nice of them,” she says. “But yeah: now, it’s like you’re gonna get lynched if you’re not thinking inclusively and with a wider range you’re gonna get wiped out. Even in the last four years, so much has happened: #MeToo, Black Lives Matter and there’s been more of a dialogue. But still, with actors, film-makers, musicians, it’s still so male-dominated, it’s crazy. There’s been these little ghettos for black music, black film, that’s like: ‘Here’s a couple of things that can get through,’ but it’s too late for that now. The conversation has created reaction and reaction makes change. You start to see things for what they are.”Today, Cherry has her own adult children and stepchildren, most of whom are continuing in the musical tradition. One of them, Mabel, has become a UK Top 10 pop star in the past couple of years. How does she feel about them entering into such an unequal industry? “I’m really good friends with a lot of my children’s friends and I look at what they’re doing. They’ve got good spirits, they’re good people with good heads on their shoulders,” she says. “This generation of humans, there’s a lot of good people that want to make a difference.”That is not to say, of course, that releasing records at the same time as your daughter doesn’t come with some home truths. “The other day, we announced the album and Mabel announced her single. Kieran was telling me how well the music’s doing, we looked and the first track already had, like, 2,000 views. Then we looked at Mabel’s and she had, like, 82,000.”Is that sobering, I wonder. “No! We were like: ‘Go Mabel!’ We can’t compete!”Cherry’s entire being is imbued with her family, genetic and otherwise. In just an hour, we have run through four generations, from Sierra Leone to the top of the UK charts. Kinship runs through her music, her personality. If anything, she is more the people around her than she is Neneh.“I was thinking that last night when I was lying next to Cameron in bed,” she says. “I was like: ‘Wow, we’ve been through some things. My father and my stepdad dying, my mum dying, his mum dying, Judy, Ray Petri, the birth of our children.’ The meaning of life has many aspects but the value of that is what it’s all about.” Broken Politics is out on Friday 19 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f50bfe106d395327b7a50eea2e706dd09339f70/0_64_2128_1708/master/2128.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=78ef33c0c990f300949de20e68766bf0 1440w","title":"revealed secret plans for brexit extension option to appease dup","story":"Effort to avoid Irish backstop would result in UK being EU ‘rule taker’ beyond 21 monthsSecret plans to allow an extension of the transition period in the Brexit withdrawal agreement could result in the UK living under all EU rules well beyond the 21 months so far negotiated, the  can reveal.The expected offer of an extension is designed to convince Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, that the “backstop” plan to avoid the creation of a hard border on the island of Ireland will never come into force.A longer transition period would mean the whole of the country would be locked into a prolonged period of what EU diplomats have previously described as a state of “vassalage”, with the House of Commons being forced to accept Brussels regulations without having any say on them.The revelation came as EU ambassadors were informed at a meeting on Friday evening that, following further concessions by the UK, good progress was being made on a Brexit deal in the negotiations and results could be made public as early as Monday should extra ground be made on the Irish border issue over the weekend.Sabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, told the 27 member states that the state of play would be assessed by the negotiating teams on Sunday evening. EU officials remain wary, however, that developments in the UK could still derail the deal.In current plans, the backstop, under which the whole of the UK would stay in a customs union while Northern Ireland alone effectively stayed in the single market, would be enacted in December 2020 if a bespoke technological solution or trade deal could not be reached by then.Foster has insisted she will not accept any Brexit deal under which Northern Ireland is treated differently to the rest of the UK.Senior Brexiters, including the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, are understood to be planning to attend cabinet next week before deciding on whether to resign. There was alarm about the language used by Downing Street on Friday that Theresa May “would never agree to a deal that would trap the UK in a backstop permanently”. They were concerned, sources said, about any backstop proposal that risks the UK staying in the customs union without a clear date for exiting it.The plan to include an extension clause in the withdrawal agreement would be a way to assuage concerns. It is being discussed privately by European commission and UK negotiators at the talks in Brussels. The length of any extension is yet to be agreed. It is likely that the UK would need to make additional budget contributions on top of its £39bn orce bill to cover the extra time it would benefit from EU membership. It would not, however, have any representation in the bloc’s decision-making institutions.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, expressed his confidence on Friday that a deal would be struck for the prime minister to sell back home.“People who put all their chips on the hypothesis of no agreement are wrong we must find an accord and I think we will find it,” he told Le Monde.“We need to make substantial progress, which we’ll review next week,” Juncker added, referring to a leaders’ summit that will start on Wednesday night with a dinner at which Brexit will be the focus of the discussion.A senior EU diplomat said that the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, could arrive at the European commission on Monday, should a deal be agreed during intensive talks over the weekend.“Mr Raab has stated he might come to Brussels on Monday,” the diplomat said. “It all depends on progress still having to be made between now and that moment. The negotiating teams are back in their offices today discussing outcome of talks over the last few days.”May asked in September last year for a transition period, which she optimistically described in her Florence speech at the time as a period of implementation of aspects of the future trade deal, including migration controls.The prime minister had said it would be “limited” to a period of about two years. She had added that she did not believe the British people would “want the UK to stay longer in the existing structures than is necessary”.Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, suggested soon after that he would only be open to an extension if it proved necessary to negotiate a trade deal.The prime minister’s spokeswoman said on Friday: “When we published our plans in June on a UK-wide customs backstop, we were absolutely clear that the arrangement would be temporary, and only in place until our future economic relationship is ready.”Mujtaba Rahman, a former Treasury and European commission official, and now head of Europe for the Eurasia Group risk consultancy, said an extra six months would be needed if only for a trade deal to be negotiated and ratified by all the member states’ parliaments.“The UK has no choice but to ask for a mechanism to extend the transition, not least to further mollify the DUP,” Rahman said. “But doing so is also a recognition of reality: both the UK and the EU’s political leadership will change next year, meaning substantive trade negotiations are unlikely to begin until September 2019 at the earliest.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group, said extending the transition “would not necessarily make the backstop redundant and would be very expensive” because of the expected additional contributions to the EU budget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0870a58052bd9f66f3e62036dd9b152d34b6cd/0_85_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3f618cbd16de84bcfbcb18246b95a3f","title":"poorest families to lose out on 210 a year owing to benefits cap","story":"Resolution Foundation analysis shows freeze imposed in 2015 is hitting low-income households with childrenLow-income families are to lose out on an extra £210 a year from next April because of the cap on benefits imposed by George Osborne in 2015, despite Theresa May’s claim that austerity is over.Analysis by the Resolution Foundation shows the freeze will cost the average low-income couple with children an additional £210 a year.The research shows that more than 10 million households will face a real-terms loss of income from the government’s centrepiece austerity measure, introduced when Osborne was chancellor.The thinktank’s senior economic analyst, Adam Corlett, said: “While the prime minister this week repeated her claim that austerity is over, significant cuts in support for millions of low-income families are set to continue next year as a result of the ongoing freeze in working age benefits.“The budget represents a last chance to cut short the benefit freeze. Scrapping it would send a strong signal that, from the perspective of low-income families, the government is committed to ending austerity.”The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is coming under increasing pressure to loosen the purse strings after used her conference speech in Birmingham to tell voters that next year’s spending review would mark the end of 10 years of cuts.“A decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off,” she said.A growing number of Conservative MPs have expressed concerns about the impact of benefits cuts – and the rollout of the controversial new universal credit system.Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the Resolution Foundation analysis was “yet more shocking evidence that Theresa May is failing to keep her promise to end austerity. Labour will end the benefit freeze, introduce a Real Living Wage of £10 an hour and put tackling poverty at the heart of government policy again.”Having fought the 2015 general election pledging to carve £12bn from the welfare bill, Osborne announced in his summer budget that year that working-age benefits would be frozen in cash terms until 2020.The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition had already severed the longstanding link between benefits and price rises, which was aimed at ensuring the standard of living for poor families did not fall behind the rest of society.Attention has focused on the damaging consequences of universal credit for poorer families in recent days, with comparisons to the Thatcher government’s poll tax from two former prime ministers, although the freeze on benefits has much wider-reaching consequences for millions of people.Alongside preventing increases in universal credit payments, the freeze also blocks real-terms rises in child benefit, tax credits, housing benefit and jobseeker’s allowance, which are paid out to far more people.About 7.3 million children across the UK, 2.4 million disabled people and 800,000 people looking for work are affected by the freeze."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ee7ef1c28a412651a8252eb419b68cc8a419dc/0_61_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb857c08f0617a35d326a889ba23458e","title":"england olly stone world cup eoin morgan sri lanka cricket","story":"• Captain praises Stone’s bowling in first outing against Sri Lanka• ‘You can’t disregard Olly from World Cup based on today’Eoin Morgan expects that with Alex Hales kicking his heels in reserve, and the back-up bowlers watching Olly Stone’s encouraging first outing, picking England’s squad for next year’s World Cup could provide the most welcome of headaches.Speaking after his England side took a 1-0 lead over Sri Lanka, the captain cited the depth of options as cause for optimism come next summer’s 50-over showpiece at home – one which he has already said could lead to his own demotion should the runs dry up.With Morgan top-scoring on 91 in the second ODI, that scenario looks fanciful at present. But with the returning Woakes picking up three wickets, and Stone’s pace shining through, the bowling spots could soon become as logjammed as at the batting.Morgan views the possible emergence of Stone, who struck with his seventh ball in international cricket, as competition for the role usually performed by Liam Plunkett, who misses the first three matches after a switch in fixtures came too late for his own wedding plans.He added: “The bowlers did a great job. Woakes goes overlooked a lot of the time. He really set the tone, he made a relaxing impression early on for Olly to come in and do exactly what he does. Olly bowled exactly like he has in the nets and that’s a really good sign: pace, he got the ball moving and all done with a very calm head. That’s a good sign.“Liam has been phenomenal for us for the last few years and when he went down injured in Australia and we found it very difficult to get a bowler with the same attributes, to bowl quick and change the pace of the game at any stage of the 50 overs.“There were signs today suggest Olly could be one of those guys. Even taking the new ball gives him a new string to his bow, Liam doesn’t really do that. I don’t think you can disregard Olly from the World Cup based on today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/624188aad085530fcbc6391b1620b3c0ea2fe541/0_265_4324_2595/master/4324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fdf9ab89c3dc103149b678576a39857","title":"toulouse bath european rugby champions cup match report","story":"Professional sport is a trying business, but it is difficult to imagine a more psychologically traumatic experience than the one Freddie Burns endured in the space of three minutes here. He contrived in the dying minutes to miss as easy a pair of opportunities to win a match that sport can offer, let alone the professional variety.Bath were trailing by two points with seven minutes to play when they were awarded a penalty in front of the posts. Burns stepped up but hit the post. Bad. But nothing compared to what followed.A brilliant Semesa Rokoduguni break had Bath deep in the Toulouse 22, where Burns slashed through the fringes to the line. Euphoric at the apparent redemption, he went to touch down with one hand, celebrating with the other, only for Maxime Medard to nip in from behind and knock the ball out of his hand.The Rec was stunned. Worse still, he was substituted a minute later, a gratuitous further humiliation, which calls into question man-management at Bath, let alone the long-harboured questions over their composure.And so Bath open their European campaign with a defeat at home, Toulouse an away win. It was a fascinating encounter, if mainly for its wildness and the chronic lack of consistency of both teams, Burns’s trauma no more than an exaggeration of the sort of thing this flaky Bath team put their supporters through on a weekly basis.Neither side could lay claim to any confidence of form, both lurking in the packed mid-tables of their respective leagues. Certainly, they played their way fitfully into a match enjoyable for its highlights, if chaotic and loose at all other times. Toulouse’s heavy artillery looked knackered for much of it Bath just looked edgy.Until such moments as either side clicked. Toulouse were first to, Medard finishing in the ninth minute after turnover ball was exploited by Toulouse’s centres and the most massive of them all, Joe Tekori, flashed the hands of a pianist to put his winger away.Toulouse otherwise sprang into life almost exclusively to the extent they could involve Cheslin Kolbe, the South Africa winger. His dazzling footwork paved the way for Sofiane Guitoune to score Toulouse’s second a few minutes before the break, pulling the visitors back to within five.In between Bath had hit their peak of coherence just before the half-hour mark, two tries of patient and precise approach work taking them into a 10-point lead. Jamie Roberts chose a powerful line for the first after Dave Attwood’s break, and pre-trauma Burns finished smartly for the other after Rhys Priestland and Jackson Willison had made the decisive inroads.We nearly had Europe’s latest red card on the stroke of half-time. The game stopped as the officials and everyone else tried to work out whether Jerome Kaino’s tackle on Roberts was worthy of rugby’s “what a hit!” approbation or its “red card!” condemnation. The farce is that it was next to impossible to tell, the margin between the two almost non-existent. The referee settled for a yellow. Roberts’s comeback from a facial injury, though, was cut short prematurely. The sooner they lower the legal height of the “big hit”, the better.Toulouse might have seen red a few minutes into the second half, when Lucas Pointud’s head caught that of Nathan Catt at a clear-out, but instead it was Bath who saw the next card - yellow to Tom Ellis for a tip tackle - and costly it would prove. Burns and Thomas Ramos had exchanged penalties before Toulouse struck just at the end of Ellis’s exile. Their forwards, suddenly looking a little less knackered with a new front row and an extra back-row forward, drove close, before Guitoune glided through the outside-centre channel. Ramos’s conversion took the visitors into the lead at the start of the final quarter.It paved the way for the misery of Burns. How long it takes him to recover from this, or even whether he does, remains to be seen. Bath’s hopes in Europe for another season are unlikely to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebce19e5f30891c5643361ce56dca9f8d5525b49/39_300_7229_4337/master/7229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e04f0c1d7eea0715b296f12ef9d2066","title":"jennifer saunders hints at age appropriate absolutely fabulous revival","story":"Comments at Cheltenham literature festival will fuel speculation that Saunders is thinking of a prequel for sitcomJennifer Saunders has hinted that Absolutely Fabulous could be revived, but said it would have to be “age-appropriate”.She said another Absolutely Fabulous was “always on my mind, always”.The comments will fuel speculation that Saunders is thinking of a prequel for the sitcom, which ran on the BBC for five series and was a movie in 2016.After the film was released she declared there would be no more. Saunders told the Daily Mail: “That. Is. It. I can’t see the point of doing anything else with it, really.”Asked a question about political correctness, Saunders said: “I think it is harder to write what we used to write because there is just always someone tutting in the back of your mind. ‘Oh what do you think? Don’t you think someone might be offended?’ It is very tiring.”Saunders said you could get away with more on the stage: “On television there is a lot of tutting and it is very annoying. I do look at some of the things we’ve done in the past and think the Twitter-sphere would go mad.”Saunders was ostensibly interviewing Jon Plowman, who has produced much of the BBC’s best comedy over a long career, including both French and Saunders and Absolutely Fabulous.They both agreed that there were not enough BBC sitcoms being produced or places to make them. “To be honest there is simply not enough studio space,” said Saunders. “In London particularly most of the TV studios are being demolished to be made into flats.”The festival discussion touched on satire and why there was not more on British television. Saunders said she never understood why a version of US show Saturday Night Live had not caught on in the UK.Plowman said: “I don’t think the people who run British television are tolerant enough. I don’t mean tolerant of the material, I mean those shows have got to be allowed to grow. They have got to be there and just become … part of the television furniture.”He said quite a lot of Saturday Night Live did not work, but that did not matter so much because few people watch it on Saturday and instead watched the funny bits on YouTube on Sunday.Plowman said he was frustrated that the UK could not not do anything as good as John Oliver’s HBO show, Last Week Tonight, and said there should be a nightly satire show on the BBC."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places.

But he agreed there should be a clampdown on outlets that have “created disorder” or “degraded” historical town centres.Andrea Marcucci, a politician from the centre-left Democratic party, said imposing curfews was among the premises of “a regime”.If the proposal became law, an industry source said, it should also apply to Italian-owned outlets, including bars, while security measures must also extend to foreign business owners.“Some say that Italian people go into their shop late at night and try to extort money from them,” said the source. “But they are too afraid to report such incidents to the police.”Salvini’s security decree, unveiled in September, includes plans to abolish key protections for immigrants and make it easier for them to be deported.On Thursday, he reiterated a plan to hire 10,000 more police officers, an initiative funded by money that previously paid for migrant reception and integration projects. Parliament has until mid-November to debate and modify the decree before it becomes law.Salvini’s latest proposal comes after Luigi Di Maio, his coalition partner, said measures would be introduced by the end of the year to limit Sunday trading in an attempt to preserve family traditions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a15c05fd74f4386c88ba2943fa081afd967cebc/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b13664a323a099f006cc80bf7b25226","title":"tory peer criticised for private meeting with ugandan president","story":"Dolar Popat hosts Yoweri Museveni, who has been condemned for rights abusesA Conservative peer has held a private meeting at parliament with the president of Uganda, who has faced condemnation for rights abuses and homophobia, prompting condemnation from Labour.Dolar Popat, a businessman and Tory life peer, who is the government’s trade envoy for Uganda and Rwanda, was scheduled to hold a lunch on Friday at the House of Lords with Yoweri Museveni, who has led Uganda since 1988, officials in the upper house said.Museveni, who is in the UK for the Illegal Wildlife Trade conference, was also due to have a private meeting with Timothy Clement-Jones, a Liberal Democrat peer, the officials said.However, it was the event with Lord Popat that brought criticism from Labour, who said it seemed anomalous to let Museveni visit parliament on a day when neither the Lords or Commons were sitting, so he could not be challenged on his rights records by any ministers.Theresa May and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, attended the wildlife conference but neither were scheduled to hold separate talks with Museveni.The Ugandan president also met Prince William for talks at Buckingham Palace on Thursday.Popat, who was born in Uganda and arrived in the UK as a teenager, is among 33 MPs and peers appointed by the Department for International Trade as envoys for certain countries or areas.Uganda’s economy is forecast to grow in the coming years with the extraction of huge oil reserves discovered in the country in 2006.Museveni is serving his fifth term as president, having changed the country’s laws to get past presidential term limits and age limits. While his supporters argue he has sought to bring stability to Uganda, he is accused of overseeing significant right abuses, particularly against critics.The most recent Amnesty International report for Uganda said the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly had been restricted, adding: “Journalists and others who criticised the president or his family were arrested, detained and harassed.”In 2014, Museveni signed into law a bill toughening criminal penalties against homophobia, with police continuing to harass LGBT people.Labour’s shadow foreign office minister in the Lords, Ray Collins, said Popat’s meeting was unacceptable.“The worsening situation in Uganda has seen local opposition leaders arrested, along with renewed threats to toughen laws that already discriminate against gay men and lesbians,” Lord Collins said.“At the recent Commonwealth heads of government meeting, Theresa May said the United Kingdom had a ‘special responsibility’ to help change hearts and minds on anti-LGBT legislation. It beggars belief therefore, that the government is allowing President Museveni to visit our parliament without any minister set to take him to task on his human rights record.”A spokesman for the Department for International Trade said Popat’s meeting with Museveni was “in his role as trade envoy to the country”.The spokesman said: “It is not good enough to merely criticise other countries from the sidelines. Only by working with Uganda are we able to bring about the changes we would like to see in the country. “As a government, we do not shy away from raising legitimate human rights concerns and encouraging Uganda to respect international law – we make this point very clearly in public and in private.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f05a0cfbdfddbac3f5bdbb29486dacafc877aca2/255_466_2968_1781/master/2968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bcb9c0ad08d5d3ebe97767f832c4dfd","title":"us israel syria agree to reopen golan crossing","story":"UN ambassador Nikki Haley says reopening of Quneitra crossing will allow better peacekeeping The United Nations, Israel and Syria have agreed to reopen the Quneitra crossing in the Golan Heights on Monday, the US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said.Haley said in a statement that the opening “will allow UN peacekeepers to step up their efforts to prevent hostilities in the Golan Heights region”.The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) has been monitoring operations in a demilitarised zone established in 1974 between the Israeli-occupied Golan and the Syrian sector, but the peacekeeping mission was disrupted by Syria’s civil war.UNDOF resumed its patrols in the area of the crossing point in August, after withdrawing in 2014 when Al-Qaeda-linked rebels overran the area, three years into the civil war.UNDOF’s return was made possible after Syrian government troops retook the Syrian side of the crossing in July under a deal with rebel fighters brokered by Moscow.It had been sealed completely since rebels overran it in April 2015, choking off one of the most important trade routes for the government.Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war and fought Syria again on the strategic plateau in a 1973 conflict.“We look to both Israel and Syria to provide UN peacekeepers the access they need as well as assurances of their safety. We also call on Syria to take the necessary steps so UNDOF can safely and effectively deploy and patrol without interference,” Haley said.Haley added that all sides must stick to a 1974 agreement and keep any military forces other than UN peacekeepers out of the zone.Military police from Russia, a major ally of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, have been patrolling on the Syrian side of Quneitra.The Quneitra crossing was used by Druze living on the Israeli side travelling to Syria for higher education or weddings.

Photograph: iStockThe State is on the verge of taking over the operation of a large part of the service for examining smear tests for the CervicalCheck programme. Under plans for the future of the analysis programme being discussed this weekend, screening staff working in Dublin for Medlab Pathology – one of the private operators currently providing part of the existing service – would be offered positions in the Irish public service.The proposals would also involve a second laboratory which currently provides services for the HSE, Quest Diagnostics in the US, being offered a contract extension at a higher price.There would be no retrospective indemnity provided by the State to cover liability for the cost of litigation arising from the cases of false negative smear tests which have emerged up to now. As part of the talks, which have been under way for several weeks, the “cliff edge” – which could have seen the analysis of cervical smear tests cease from this weekend if no deal was reached – has been removed. Contracts between the State and the two laboratories, which analyse about 260,000 smear test samples a year – or about 90 per cent of the total between them – are due to expire this weekend.The remaining 10 per cent of smear test analysis is handled by a laboratory at the public Coombe Hospital in Dublin. However, while agreements had not been finalised on Thursday night between the State and the two large-scale private sector providers, the parties seemed to be inching towards a new accord which would see the screening service continue in operation, albeit at a higher cost and with significant reforms.It is understood an outline deal has been reached between State negotiations and Quest which would see the company receive a significant increase on the $27 (€23) fee it currently receives per smear test on average. Some sources suggested the new fee could be a little less than double the existing arrangement.Overall, the proposed new deal could cost an additional €4 million, sources suggested. Sources said that a deal could be reached with Quest next week. The HSE and the laboratories were at loggerheads in the talks over who should accept liability for the cost of litigation arising from false negative smears in the CervicalCheck programme. The laboratories assert the claims environment in Ireland has changed since the controversy broke last April, with the Irish courts more likely to make findings of negligence than in other countries.With more than 100 cases being brought by women who received false negative smear tests and who are alleging negligence, legal costs arising from the CervicalCheck programme could exceed €50 million, it has been claimed. At issue too is the question of liability for the backlog of tens of thousands of slides which has built up since the controversy began.The rate at which labs process slides has slowed considerably since the summer because of concerns raised by the rate of litigation. Demand has also increased as thousands of women took up the offer by Minister for Health Simon Harris of a repeat smear where they had concerns."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Take Back the City ends occupation of firm\u0026rsquos offices aimed at highlighting impact on housing crisisSecret plans designed to convince Foster that backstop will not come into forceASTI decides to ballot union members without giving a recommendationDUP leader says she will vote against any Brexit deal she believes undermines unionVaradkar makes number of changes following shock resignation of Denis NaughtenReform of the city\u0026rsquos bus routes, modified from a Jarrett Walker plan, has been very turbulentCar hits wall on the N4 between Edgeworthstown and MullingarWithdrawal of case represents a significant victory for AvivaKaja Godek is being sued by 16 LGBTI+ people over comments on the TaoiseachTelco entrepreneur with a home in Co Clare sold his first phone company for $14bnMr Justice Peter Charleton found the former Garda press officer lied in an affidavitLeo Varadkar and Miche\u0026aacutel Martin to meet next week on future of confidence-and-supplyStaff in one private lab would be offered posts in public service under new proposalsPrepare for the worst, says technical note on the sector published on Friday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660278.1539269071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit the truck driver and 20 tonnes of frozen chicken","story":"Simon Carswell travels with truck driver Stephen Heasley to find out how post-Brexit customs checks could affect food supplies.

Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Housing activists occupied Airbnb’s Dublin offices on Saturday, in protest over the short-term letting platform’s “impact on the housing crisis”.The Airbnb head office was open on Saturday as part of Open House Dublin architecture event that allows public access to buildings. As a result of the protest, access to the Airbnb offices as part of the event had to be cancelled. Shortly after 11am on Saturday a group of activists from Take Back the City entered the Grand Canal Dock offices with a large banner. The group ended the “flash occupation” of the building roughly two hours later. The activist group has called for “a total ban” on Airbnb and similar short-term letting platforms in Ireland. The campaigners claim the platforms are keeping properties that could be used for long-term rental accommodation off the market. In a short Facebook post, Open House organisers Irish Architecture Foundation said: “Sad news guys. Airbnb is cancelled for today.” The group, Take Back the City, is currently occupying 41 Belvedere Place in Dublin 1 in defiance of a High Court order to vacate the property.The building is the third vacant property the activists have occupied since early August as part of a protest over the amount of vacant housing in Dublin.The Government has been considering introducing legislation to regulate short-term letting platforms. Speaking to The , one activist involved in the protest, Conor Reddy, said short-term letting platforms were “compounding” the housing shortage in the capital. The flash occupation was part of a new stage for the campaign, which would target other symbolic buildings, he said. “There are the offices of vulture funds around that area of the city, so they are potential targets,” he said. The group is looking to take the campaign to a “larger scale, branch out of the city centre into the suburbs,” and grow into a national protest movement, he said. In a statement, Take Back the City said Airbnb had “exacerbated the housing crisis in Dublin and Ireland as a whole”. “Our tenant support groups frequently hear from people who have been evicted on grounds of ‘significant renovations’, only to find their old homes subsequently rented out on Airbnb and other short-term letting platforms.” The statement said there were three times more properties available on Airbnb in Dublin than were being advertised for long-term rent. It added that in 2017, there was a 63 per cent increase in Airbnb usage across Ireland and over the same period the number of people declaring themselves homelessness rose by 2,000."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3662904.1539439782!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit plans could see uk tied to eu rules well beyond end of 2020","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSecret plans to allow an extension of the transition period in the Brexit withdrawal agreement could result in the UK living under all EU rules well beyond the 21 months so far negotiated.  Secret plans to allow an extension of the transition period in the Brexit withdrawal agreement could result in the UK living under all EU rules well beyond the 21 months so far negotiated.The expected offer of an extension is designed to convince Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, that the “backstop” plan to avoid the creation of a hard border on the island of Ireland will never come into force.A longer transition period would mean the whole of the country would be locked into a prolonged period of what EU diplomats have previously described as a state of “vassalage,” with the House of Commons being forced to accept Brussels regulations without having any say on them.The revelation came as EU ambassadors were informed at a meeting on Friday evening that, following further concessions by the UK, good progress was being made on a Brexit deal in the negotiations and results could be made public as early as Monday should extra ground be made on the Irish border issue over the weekend.Sabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, told the 27 member states that the state of play would be assessed by the negotiating teams on Sunday evening. EU officials remain wary, however, that developments in the UK could still derail the deal.In current plans, the backstop, under which the whole of the UK would stay in a customs union while Northern Ireland alone effectively stayed in the single market, would be enacted in December 2020 if a bespoke technological solution or trade deal could not be reached by then.DUP leader Arlene Foster has insisted she will not accept any Brexit deal under which Northern Ireland is treated differently to the rest of the UK.Senior Brexiters, including the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, are understood to be planning to attend cabinet next week before deciding on whether to resign. There was alarm about the language used by Downing Street on Friday that Theresa May “would never agree to a deal that would trap the UK in a backstop permanently”. They were concerned, sources said, about any backstop proposal that risks the UK staying in the customs union without a clear date for exiting it.The plan to include an extension clause in the withdrawal agreement would be a way to assuage concerns. It is being discussed privately by European commission and UK negotiators at the talks in Brussels. The length of any extension is yet to be agreed. It is likely that the UK would need to make additional budget contributions on top of its £39 billion orce bill to cover the extra time it would benefit from EU membership. It would not, however, have any representation in the bloc’s decision-making institutions.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, expressed his confidence on Friday that a deal would be struck for the prime minister to sell back home.“People who put all their chips on the hypothesis of no agreement are wrong we must find an accord and I think we will find it,” he told Le Monde.“We need to make substantial progress, which we’ll review next week,” Juncker added, referring to a leaders’ summit that will start on Wednesday night with a dinner at which Brexit will be the focus of the discussion.A senior EU diplomat said that the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, could arrive at the European commission on Monday, should a deal be agreed during intensive talks over the weekend.“Mr Raab has stated he might come to Brussels on Monday,” the diplomat said. “It all depends on progress still having to be made between now and that moment. The negotiating teams are back in their offices today discussing outcome of talks over the last few days.”Mrs May asked in September last year for a transition period, which she optimistically described in her Florence speech at the time as a period of implementation of aspects of the future trade deal, including migration controls.The UK prime minister had said it would be “limited” to a period of about two years. She had added that she did not believe the British people would “want the UK to stay longer in the existing structures than is necessary”.Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, suggested soon after that he would only be open to an extension if it proved necessary to negotiate a trade deal.The prime minister’s spokeswoman said on Friday: “When we published our plans in June on a UK-wide customs backstop, we were absolutely clear that the arrangement would be temporary, and only in place until our future economic relationship is ready.”Mujtaba Rahman, a former Treasury and European commission official, and now head of Europe for the Eurasia Group risk consultancy, said an extra six months would be needed if only for a trade deal to be negotiated and ratified by all the member states’ parliaments.“The UK has no choice but to ask for a mechanism to extend the transition, not least to further mollify the DUP,” Rahman said. “But doing so is also a recognition of reality: both the UK and the EU’s political leadership will change next year, meaning substantive trade negotiations are unlikely to begin until September 2019 at the earliest.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group, said extending the transition “would not necessarily make the backstop redundant and would be very expensive” because of the expected additional contributions to the EU budget.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has made a number of new ministerial appointment on Saturday morning following the shock resignation of Denis Naughten last week.Richard Bruton has been appointed Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, replacing Mr Naughten.The appointment of Mr Bruton will be seen as placing a steady pair of hands at the helm of the department as it struggles to regain control of the €500 million broadband project.Government Chief Whip Joe McHugh has been appointed Minister for Education and Skills, replacing Mr Bruton.Minister of State Sean Kyne is promoted to Chief Whip and Minister for the Gaeltacht and the islands.Galway East Independent TD Seán Canney is to be appointment Minister of State at the\u0026nbspDepartments of Rural and Community Development and Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.The appointments are subject to the approval of the Dáil and the Cabinet.While the changes do not alter the arithmetic for the Government - as Mr Canney has traditionally voted with it - giving him a ministerial portfolio solidifies his support.Political focus will now turn to whether political overtures are made by the Taoiseach to other Independent TDs, and in particular Galway West deputy Noel Grealish, in a bid to secure additional support.Mr Canney was a former member of the Independent Alliance, before leaving the grouping in May this year. Under his new position he will be responsible for rural affairs and natural resources.The working majority of the Government was threatened this week following the resignation of Mr Naughten over a controversy which has thrown the future of the national broadband plan into question.Mr Naughten held four private dinners with David McCourt, the chairman of Granahan McCourt, the only remaining bidder for the broadband contract.A report into whether the procurement process has been compromised by the meetings is due to be carried out.Mr Canney was a former minister of state with responsibility for the Office of Public Works and flood relief, during his time in the Independent Alliance.He left the grouping following a dispute with his colleague Kevin “Boxer” Moran, over the terms of an agreement to rotate a junior ministry position between the pair in Government.Since leaving the grouping Mr Canney has voted with the Government as an Independent.Mr Canney told The  on Saturday his main challenge would be to “get balanced regional development” for rural Ireland.“Over the last week the one thing we cannot forget is the importance of the national broadband plan. That has to be completed, and all I can say is I will give Minister Bruton any support that I can on that,” he said.It was “essential for rural Ireland” that the procurement process to deliver the plan did not collapse, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3662881.1539435201!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"presidential debate focuses on spending in the %C3%A1ras","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Presidential candidates: Gavin Duffy, Joan Freeman, Liadh Ní Riada, Peter Casey, Sean Gallagher and Michael D.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill The   Transparency around the spending in the Office of the President has been criticised by several candidates in the first presidential radio debate with all candidates.Mr Gallagher said he had concerns over the “extravagance attached to the office” under President Michael D Higgins, and the lack of financial transparency.“We’ve heard stories of €3,000 a night hotels, the issue for us as taxpayers, we’re not in a position to see these figures,” he said. If elected he would stay in accommodation attached to Irish embassies when abroad, rather than hotels, he said.President Higgins defended spending in Áras an Uachtaráin, and committed to publishing more transparent details of expenditure if re-elected.Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada said moves to publish detailed financial breakdowns of spending in the office “is something that should have been addressed at the beginning” of Mr Higgins’ first term. She also said the salary of the President was “exorbitant.”Mr Casey said President Higgins was “totally disingenuous” when it came to commitments to transparency around the spending of his office.“We don’t have to wait until you are elected to see how much money you are wasting in the Áras,” he said.The first debate attended by all six candidates in the presidential election took place today at 1pm, on RTÉ Radio One.It was\u0026nbspthe first debate featuring the incumbent President Michael D Higgins after he did not attend a previous radio debate, due to a scheduling conflict.During the debate Mr Gallagher committed to publishing his tax clearance certificates in the coming days. He was responding to questions from Ms Ní Riada about whether he would have any conflict of interests if elected, due to his directorships in several companies.Asked by Ms Ní Riada what he had “being doing for the last seven years,” since he ran for the presidency in 2011. Mr Gallagher said: “In 2011 I like many people in this country I started again ... I pay my tax in Ireland, I’m fully compliant with tax.”Asked about his commercial interests former Dragons’ Den investors Gavin Duffy said he had suspended work for his company Gavin Duffy \u0026amp Associates, until after the election.Former Dragons’ Den investor Peter Casey also said he had stepped aside from the “day to day” running of his businesses.Independent Senator Joan Freeman said she “had no choice” but to take a €120,000 loan to finance her campaign, from US-based businessman Des Walsh, of Herbalife, a company which had to pay a substantial fine arising from allegations of pyramid selling.One of the key roles of the Presidency is to sign legislation into law and the President also holds the power to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court, if there are concerns it conflicts with the Constitution.Ms Freeman said in a situation where legislation was passed by the Oireachtas to ban evictions for three years, she would refer the Bill to the Supreme Court.Mr Gallagher said he would “likely put the bill into law and allow it be tested that way,” unless the Attorney General or Council of State raised concerns over the bill.Ms Ní Riada said she would address the House of the Oireachtas on the issue of homelessness if elected.Palestine would be one of the first locations she would visit as Head of State, she said. “You’re not there to be just following the Government’s lead,” she said.The presidential election will take place in two weeks time on Friday, October 26th.A Red C poll released on Friday showed Mr Higgins had a significant lead in the race, with 70 per cent support, among 1,000 people randomly polled.Mr Gallagher was the nearest contender on 14 per cent, followed by Ms Freeman on 6 per cent, Ms Ní Riada (5 per cent), Mr Duffy (4 per cent), and Mr Casey (1 per cent).Yesterday Mr Gallagher launched his campaign, and played down suggestions the contest was a foregone conclusion, given Mr Higgins’ apparent lead. Most voters would only engage with the election in the next two weeks, he said.The presidential radio debate will last for an hour and is being moderated by broadcaster Cormac Ó hEadhra.The other key debates featuring all the candidates will take place on October 17th, on Virgin Media TV hosted by presenter Pat Kenny, and October 23rd on RTÉ’s Prime Time."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3661699.1539380492!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"se%C3%A1n gallagher received 130 000 from rt%C3%A9 over frontline debate","story":"Seán Gallagher held the official launch of his Presidential campaign in the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeán Gallagher and Martin McGuinness on RTÉ’s ‘Frontline’ during the 2011 presidential election campaign.

His support subsequently collapsed, and he was beaten into second place by Michael D Higgins. The terms of the settlement between RTÉ and Mr Gallagher, reached late last year in advance of a High Court hearing of the case, were never revealed, with the broadcaster stating publicly only that it had paid the businessman “substantial damages”.Mr Gallagher’s complaint centred on the use of a tweet mentioned during the programme which purported to come from an official Twitter account of Martin McGuinness, the late Sinn Féin politician who was also running for the presidency. The tweet said that a businessman from whom Mr Gallagher had sought funds for Fianna Fáil would be coming forward.Although the account that the tweet came from was not an official Sinn Féin account, the businessman – Hugh Morgan – did come forward subsequently. The programme and the subsequent appearance of the businessman undermined Mr Gallagher’s attempts to distance himself from Fianna Fáil during the campaign.As part of the settlement, RTÉ also apologised to Mr Gallagher, acknowledging that the production of the Frontline debate “fell significantly short of the standards expected by the public and required by law”.In a statement afterwards, Mr Gallagher said his motivation in taking the case was “not just about the unfairness shown to him but also about protecting the integrity of the democratic process and ensuring that what happened to him will not be allowed to happen again”.Revelations of the relatively modest size of Mr Gallagher’s settlement will come as a surprise in political and media circles where much larger sums were thought to have changed hands.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3661484.1539355903!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit explained what is theresa may s chequers plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May and members of her Cabinet in her country retreat Chequers in July 2018. Photograph: Joel Rouse via Getty ImagesThe Chequers Plan was tabled by British prime minister Theresa May at Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat north west of London, and agreed by her cabinet in early July 2018. The plan, officially named “The Future Relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, ” details how she sees the UK’s trading relationship with the EU working after Britain formally leaves the economic bloc in March 2019.May wants to create a “common rule book” for industrial goods and agricultural products that would mean Britain would have to sign up to EU rules for manufactured goods, food and other farm produce without having a say in determining those rules. This would give the UK access to the EU single market and its 500 million consumers for all goods, including food and drink. A “facilitated customs arrangement” between the UK and the EU would remove the need for customs checks and controls between them, operating as a “combined customs territory” or tariff-free area. The UK would charge its own tariffs and trade policies for goods heading to the UK and it would collect EU tariffs on EU-bound goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. The plan would allow the UK develop an independent trade policy with the rest of the world, fulfilling the Brexiteer promise to be able to agree trade deals with other countries. Under the proposal, there is no plan for services such as banking and finance, which makes up 80 per cent of the UK’s economy and which the country exports right across the EU. May proposed dealing with services under a separate arrangement that would give the UK much more flexibility to set its own rules, “recognising the UK and the EU will not have current levels of access to each other’s markets.”Under the proposal, goods would travel more or less unhindered across the EU-UK border so Britain sees the Chequers plan as ensuring co-operation on trade which would solve the Irish Border question, one of the most intractable problems that has so far proven impossible to solve by EU and UK negotiators.The proposal, creating a free trade area of goods between the EU and UK, would effectively continue existing regulatory and customs arrangements for industrial and food products after Brexit as the UK would agree to accept future regulations agreed in Brussels by making an up-front commitment, by way of a treaty, to “ongoing harmonisation with EU rules.”Yes. It is similar to the arrangement that Norway, which is outside the EU but inside the European Economic Area, has with the bloc. Norway makes a contribution to the EU budget and abides by EU rules - most often referred to as a “rule-taker” - and the rulings of the European Court of Justice, which enforces them, in exchange for having access to the single market.No. The UK proposes establishing a “joint institutional framework” to interpret agreements between the EU and the UK that would be done by each side’s respective courts. UK courts would pay “due regard” to EU case law in areas where the common rulebook continued to apply and cases would still be referred to the European Court of Justice as the interpreter of EU rules, but disputes would be resolved through a “Joint Committee” and neither an EU court or UK court could resolve disputes between the two.Yes. The UK parliament, under the Chequers plan, would be able to block any changes to the EU rules “recognising that this would have consequences.” The plan would also mean the UK would no longer agree to the EU rule covering the free movement of people across borders, a key demand for hardline Brexit supporters and eroding one of the EU’s “four freedoms” - free movement of goods, services and capital are the others - set by Brussels for having access to the single market.Not well. The EU said that while it had some positive elements, it was unworkable, arguing that Britain was essentially cherry-picking EU rules it liked for access to the single market and choosing not to accept others. Brussels fears that the UK businesses would be given an unfair advantage over their EU competitors if the UK only has to apply some EU rules and not others, for example on environmental protections. The EU is also concerned about a third country outside the reach of its supervision and beyond the remit of the European Court of Justice controlling its borders and collecting tariffs on its behalf.Not universally well. It led to the resignation of two senior cabinet members, Brexit secretary David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson. Davis argued that adhering to EU rules would leave Britain’s “fingers caught in this mangle” and render control of the British parliament over UK law “more illusory that real.” More controversially, Johnson said that the plan “wrapped a suicide vest” around the British constitution and “handed the detonator” to Brussels. He has called on May to “chuck Chequers.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Julien Behal British and European Union negotiators are meeting throughout the weekend in an attempt to agree the text of a Northern Ireland Brexit backstop ahead of next Wednesday’s summit in Brussels. Downing Street said on Friday that Theresa May would not agree to any deal that kept Britain indefinitely within a customs union with the EU. “The prime minister would never agree to a deal which would trap the UK in a backstop permanently,” Mrs May’s official spokeswoman said.The spokeswoman said Britain wanted a temporary customs arrangement for the whole of the UK written into the legal text of the withdrawal agreement as part of the backstop. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said consistently that the backstop must be specific to Northern Ireland and that customs arrangements for the whole of the UK should be part of a political declaration about the future relationship between Britain and the EU.Mr Barnier’s deputy, Sabine Weyand, on Friday night updated EU ambassadors about the negotiations, which are expected to continue into Monday. Mrs May met members of her inner cabinet on Thursday evening but she did not seek their support for any new negotiating position.Conservative Brexiteers, including some cabinet ministers, are alarmed by reports that Mrs May is preparing to accept that the backstop, including an all-UK customs arrangement, will have no explicit time limit.Brexit secretary\u0026nbspDominic Raab said on Friday that any backstop must be time-limited. “It would have to be finite, it would have to be short and it would have to be, I think, time-limited in order for it to be supported here,” he said.“What we cannot do is see the United Kingdom locked in via the backdoor to a customs union arrangement which would leave us in an indefinite limbo – that would not be leaving the EU.”\u0026nbspMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the backstop, which is designed to guarantee that there will be no hard border in any circumstances, cannot by definition be time-limited.“If the issues aren’t resolved in three years you can’t do away with the insurance mechanism. We can’t accept a time limit, but we can accept it will only be there unless and until something better is agreed in the future, which is what everyone wants,” he told Sky News.Mr Coveney also criticised the weight being given in public discourse to the DUP’s threats to withdraw support for the Conservative government if it is unhappy with the backstop. “The DUP represents a minority of people in Northern Ireland,” he said.“The majority of people in Northern Ireland are looking for something quite different from what the DUP is looking for, and yet the DUP is given this platform as if it speaks for Northern Ireland.”Northern Ireland could face power cuts in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to the latest batch of technical notices from the British government. There is a single electricity market on the island of Ireland and the British government would try to work with Dublin to ensure that current arrangements could continue after a no-deal Brexit.If such an agreement was not possible, Britain would seek to ensure an adequate electricity supply to Northern Ireland, including “demand-side measures” that would limit electricity use.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

by-election for Morrison\u0027s ruling Liberal-National coalition in the blue-ribbon Sydney seat of Wentworth on Oct. 20.I will be taking action to ensure amendments are introduced as soon as practicable to make it clear that no student of a non-state school should be expelled on the basis of their sexuality, Morrison said in a statement.The statement, which urged parliament to tackle the issue over the next two weeks, follows an offer of support by the largest opposition party, Labour, to repeal legal exemptions that allow religious schools to discriminate.Archbishop Mark Coleridge, the president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, called this week for equality in school employment and enrolment.Once employed or enrolled, people within a Catholic school community are expected to adhere to the school\u0027s mission and values, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper quoted him as saying.Australia\u0027s parliament voted to legalise same-sex marriage in December after a

The recommendations have not been publicly disclosed.Our government does not support expulsion of students from religious non-state schools on the basis of their sexuality, he added.Comment: Our deadly cabbage of a leader has damned us to a miserable Brexit defeatDavid Attenborough says smiling was key to getting cannibal tribe to accept himBook re-opens row over whether French gallantry is a \u0026#39poisonous myth\u0026#39 or national treasure Donald Trump vows \u0026#39severe punishment\u0026#39 if Saudi Arabia murdered journalist Jamal KhashoggiCourthouse scuffle as defendant lunges for gunUK\u0026#39s official naturist group sees boost in membership for first time in 15 yearsAshes to ashes on the last journey of Flying Scotsman\u0026#39s saviourComment: Let’s end the isive public narcissism of identity politicsSergei Skripal briefed Swiss intelligence services on Russian spy unit accused of poisoning himInside the school that promises a better future for girls escaping Boko Haram\u0026#39s sex slavery and suicide bombingsThousands of homes without power, roads shut and trains cancelled as Storm Callum batters the UK Comment: Yes, we should teach the full legacy of Empire, and the real meaning of Remembrance too From fly away hats to Robbie Williams hits: how Eugenie and Jack\u0026#39s guests partied into the early hoursPennsylvania Republican candidate threatens to stomp on opponent\u0026#39s face with golf spikesMeet the Gen-Z tycoons running million-pound businesses... before they\u0026#39ve even left schoolHow Russian troll factories used Twitter to discredit life-saving vaccinesComment: RIP the Bullingdon Club: I can\u0026#39t say I\u0026#39ll be sorry to see you go Comment: From the Empire to Tony Blair: a Corbynista guide to British historyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"end divisive public narcissism identity politics","story":"The Government\u0026#39s ethnic pay gap plans are intrusive and self-defeatingObsessions over gender, race and sexuality are a self-indulgent distraction from global crises  I am not a Woman Journalist.

So, fulfilling his wishes has been tremendously important to me,” she told The Sunday .“It’s been amazing because my father was somebody who dreamed of steam engines and was so passionate about their preservation.“And so, those dreams have today continued even after his passing. I can’t quite believe it. It’s been very emotional.”British businessman Alan Pegler (1920-2012), new owner of the LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman steam locomotive, pictured standing in front of the engine at Kings Cross station in London prior to its last scheduled run on 14th January 1963 Alan Francis Pegler was born into a family of manufacturers from Retford, Nottinghamshire. During his childhood he played at being a porter at his local railway station at Barnby Moor, watching the trains on the Great Northern mainline.He first saw the Flying Scotsman at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924, when he was just four years old. And so began a love affair that was to define the rest of his life.The Flying Scotsman begins the climb up Stoke Bank on the East Coast Main Line with the \u0026#39Farewell to Alan Pegler\u0026#39 charterIn 1946 he joined his family’s business, the Northern Rubber Company, before serving as a Naval flyer and later the RAF in World War II.The Cambridge University graduate went on to join the British Railways’ Regional Board in a part time and non-executive role.Alan Pegler\u0026#39s daughter aboard the Flying Scotsman in London In January 1963, the 60103 Flying Scotsman retired from service having covered some 2,076,000 miles on its route between London and Edinburgh on the North Eastern Railway.The train, built in 1923 for the London and North Eastern Railway at Doncaster Works, was destined for the scrapheap where it would be broken up.With the age of steam drawing to a close due to the so-called ‘dieselisation’ of the network, Pegler bought the Scotsman in 1963 for £3,000.He restored the locomotive, with its striking apple green livery, to its former glory and brokered deals with British Rail to allow it to still venture out on the network.Passengers raise a glass in memory to Alan Pegler who saved the Flying Scotsman back in 1963Wearing his blue overalls, he was regularly interviewed and photographed on the footplate promoting the engine that had done so much for the age of steam.He also took it on tours to America, Canada and Australia, where it set a record for the longest non-stop run by a steam powered locomotive when in 1989 it clocked up 422 miles.Penny Vaudoyer, Alan Pegler\u0026#39s daughter, at the footplate where she saw her father\u0026#39s ashes scattered in the fireboxDavid Buck, chairman of the Steam Dreams Rail Company which organised yesterday trip, said: “I have been simply amazed by the sheer well of affection for Alan who is clearly the man the nation thinks of when talking about the Flying Scotsman and its post British Rail career.“From top to bottom throughout the industry everybody has come come together to make this possible and it has been a truly wonderful and emotional tribute to a great man.”The front of the Flying Scotsman on yesterday’s trip carried the signage saying ‘Farewell Alan Pegler’.Comment: Our deadly cabbage of a leader has damned us to a miserable Brexit defeatDavid Attenborough says smiling was key to getting cannibal tribe to accept himBook re-opens row over whether French gallantry is a \u0026#39poisonous myth\u0026#39 or national treasure Donald Trump vows \u0026#39severe punishment\u0026#39 if Saudi Arabia murdered journalist Jamal KhashoggiCourthouse scuffle as defendant lunges for gunUK\u0026#39s official naturist group sees boost in membership for first time in 15 yearsComment: Let’s end the isive public narcissism of identity politicsSergei Skripal briefed Swiss intelligence services on Russian spy unit accused of poisoning himInside the school that promises a better future for girls escaping Boko Haram\u0026#39s sex slavery and suicide bombingsThousands of homes without power, roads shut and trains cancelled as Storm Callum batters the UK Comment: Yes, we should teach the full legacy of Empire, and the real meaning of Remembrance too From fly away hats to Robbie Williams hits: how Eugenie and Jack\u0026#39s guests partied into the early hoursAustralian PM seeks to ban schools from expelling gay studentsPennsylvania Republican candidate threatens to stomp on opponent\u0026#39s face with golf spikesMeet the Gen-Z tycoons running million-pound businesses... before they\u0026#39ve even left schoolHow Russian troll factories used Twitter to discredit life-saving vaccinesComment: RIP the Bullingdon Club: I can\u0026#39t say I\u0026#39ll be sorry to see you go Comment: From the Empire to Tony Blair: a Corbynista guide to British historyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000177610545_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8W44mZEW0zcVUHYed3romhKi2sT3vi7ux2-RDZwC4QA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"inside school promises better future girls escaping boko harams","story":"Aisha Bukar, deputy head of the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Maiduguri, Nigeria  Had she not panicked at the final moment, Aisha Aminu\u0027s last act would have been to kill herself and as many others as possible.Kidnapped last year by Boko Haram, the 15-year-old was conscripted into its army of child suicide bombers, with orders to blow herself up in a busy marketplace.

She hesitated just long enough for police to arrive.A year on, Aisha is among hundreds of ex-Boko Haram captives at a rehabilitation charity in Maiduguri, the dusty city in north-east Nigeria where the country\u0027s jihadist movement sprang up.Recovering from life in a group that treats women as either sex slaves or cannon fodder is not easy: Aisha was so traumatised that she was mute for the first few months, while others are plagued by nightmares, flashbacks and thoughts of suicide.Yet for Fatima Akilu, the NHS-trained psychologist who runs the charity, what is equally disturbing is that not every former hostage regrets their time with the group.In the remote, impoverished villages where Boko Haram has its strongholds, becoming a bush wife is the closest some women ever get to empowerment.A teacher holds a counselling session for boys at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Maiduguri, NigeriaIt isn\u0027t true of all cases, but some of the wives of senior Boko Haram commanders have told me that while they were with the group, they felt empowered for the first time in their lives, said Dr Akilu, a Nigerian Muslim is also a children\u0027s author.They\u0027d often be in command of a harem of women themselves, sometimes hundreds of them, and they\u0027d learn how to use weapons as well.They felt a power they\u0027d never have in their own communities, where they\u0027d usually get married aged 12, and where husbands would then dictate their lives.Counterintuitive though they may be, Dr Akilu\u0027s insights draw on a lifetime studying the murkier side of the human psyche.Educated at boarding school in Tunbridge Wells, she studied psychiatry in Britain and the US before working with young offenders, paedophiles and murderers, including John Hinckley Jr, the man who shot President Ronald Reagan.In 2012, Nigeria\u0027s National Security Agency asked her to devise a local equivalent to Britain\u0027s Prevent counter-extremism project, after reading articles she had written on the role of education in fighting radicalism.How the Nigerian government is fuelling Boko Haram\u0026#039s kidnapping industryAs Director for Behavioural Analysis, she ran prison deradicalisation programs for jailed Boko Haram commanders and their wives, before setting up her own charity, the Neem Foundation, in 2016. It aims to help the tens of thousands of other Nigerians who have spent time in Boko Haram camps, be it voluntarily or as hostages.The group, which has killed an estimated 20,000 people, remains a force to be reckoned with, despite losing much of its turf in the past three years. It still holds around 100 of the 276 schoolgirls snatched from the town of Chibok in 2014, and last month also killed one of three kidnapped local aid workers.But as well as the ongoing military struggle, there is now a hearts and minds challenge to re-integrate those once brainwashed by the group. There are thousands of these people now drifting back into cities and refugee camps,” Dr Akilu said. “They need help, otherwise the problems could last for decades.”At a compound down a backstreet in Maiduguri, the Neem Foundation provides a school for female ex-captives, which is often their first experience of a classroom.\u0026#34Amina\u0026#34, a 17-year-old former hostage of Boko Haram at the Neem Foundation school in Bakassi refugee camp in Maiduguri. She spent 18 months with the groupConducted in English rather than local languages, it is a rebuff to Boko Haram\u0027s mantra that Western education is sinful, although the syllabus goes beyond just the 3Rs. Diversity is an important lesson too, given the inter-tribal chauvinism that Boko Haram exploits.A lot of our pupils are brought up to believe that their own tribe is greatest, be they Hausa, Fulani or Kanuri (the latter the tribe of Boko Haram leader Abubakr Shekau), said Aisha Bukar, the school\u0027s deputy head. By getting them to swap tribes in role-plays, we teach them that Nigeria is a place of many tribes and faiths.Indeed, a few of the program\u0027s clients are unaware that Nigeria even exists as a country, thinking it represents just the wider area around their village.Such limited horizons make them easy prey for Boko Haram’s doctrines, which include the bizarre claim that the world is flat. It also lets the group present itself variously as a world-conquering jihadist force, a glamorous Mafia, and even a local version of the Boy Scouts.There\u0027s a whole range of reasons why people join up, mostly to do with lack of opportunity, said Dr Akilu. For some, it\u0027s the chance to be in a gang and carry a gun. For others, especially adolescents, it\u0027s just a chance to be part of something, to have an adventure. Then there some who join up because Boko Haram gave them money to start a business. It may be just cash to buy a wheelbarrow, but that means the world to people in communities that have nothing.She stresses that despite such blandishments, Boko Haram still has to recruit most of its followers by force. Yet stigma abounds.In a refugee camp where the charity runs another program, Amina Ahmed, 17, who was impregnated by her captors and then miscarried, told how even her own mother blamed her at first. She asked me: \u0027why did you accept?\u0027, and I told her it was because I had no choice, she said, a tear rolling down her cheek. Here I can at least meet other people who\u0027ve had the same problems.A \u0026#34conflict resolution\u0026#34 class at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Bakassi refugee camp in MaiduguriTo date, the Neem Foundation has helped more than 7,000 people affected by Boko Haram, some via a special counselling on wheels service that sends staff out to remoter areas. How successful it will be, only time will tell, although Dr Akilu does already have an endorsement from one important source.During her time working with Boko Haram\u0027s jailed commanders, she persuaded one of the group\u0027s chief imams to back her program, after months of fiery debate about different interpretations of Islam.  He was one of the main leaders who opposed Western education, but halfway through the program, he changed his mind and decided he\u0027d been misleading people. she said. He asked if we could get his children into school, which we did, and now that he\u0027s been freed from prison, he\u0027s gone back to school too.The names of some interviewees have been changed.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityComment: Our deadly cabbage of a leader has damned us to a miserable Brexit defeatDavid Attenborough says smiling was key to getting cannibal tribe to accept himBook re-opens row over whether French gallantry is a \u0026#39poisonous myth\u0026#39 or national treasure Donald Trump vows \u0026#39severe punishment\u0026#39 if Saudi Arabia murdered journalist Jamal KhashoggiCourthouse scuffle as defendant lunges for gunUK\u0026#39s official naturist group sees boost in membership for first time in 15 yearsAshes to ashes on the last journey of Flying Scotsman\u0026#39s saviourComment: Let’s end the isive public narcissism of identity politicsSergei Skripal briefed Swiss intelligence services on Russian spy unit accused of poisoning himThousands of homes without power, roads shut and trains cancelled as Storm Callum batters the UK Comment: Yes, we should teach the full legacy of Empire, and the real meaning of Remembrance too From fly away hats to Robbie Williams hits: how Eugenie and Jack\u0026#39s guests partied into the early hoursAustralian PM seeks to ban schools from expelling gay studentsPennsylvania Republican candidate threatens to stomp on opponent\u0026#39s face with golf spikesMeet the Gen-Z tycoons running million-pound businesses... before they\u0026#39ve even left schoolHow Russian troll factories used Twitter to discredit life-saving vaccinesComment: RIP the Bullingdon Club: I can\u0026#39t say I\u0026#39ll be sorry to see you go Comment: From the Empire to Tony Blair: a Corbynista guide to British historyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/22/TELEMMGLPICT000167420993_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqtkFNGfLQhkpVPeNfby9bQTlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"uks official naturist group sees boost membership first time","story":"Nudists practice yoga in the inaugural Parisian Day of Naturism near ParisLife and TimesThe UK\u0027s official naturist organisation has seen a boost in membership for the first time in 15 years after hosting public bare all events designed to make nude lifestyles more mainstream.British Naturism reported this week its representatives had swelled by nearly 10 per cent this year, with the increase partly credited to a shift in approach away from behind-closed-doors functions to public outings including trips to restaurants, theatres and galleries. Naked yoga and running classes was also said to have helped encourage newcomers to the movement as well as outdoor festivals such as Nudefest and Nudestock.Andrew Welch, British Naturism\u0027s commercial manager, claimed prudish attitudes towards nudity were evaporating while businesses have become increasingly open to hosting their own bare all events. He said: At the moment we are around 8,900 members, so last year we were around 8,300 members.  This is the first time our membership has been rising for the last 15 years.  ‘‘There is a much less of a taboo when it comes to naturism.  In the past if you told people you were a naturist there would be raised eyebrows, but now people are much more aware of what it is.  ‘‘Historically people have viewed us with circumspection ‘who are these people walking around with their bits out’.‘‘We have been finding that now the taboo has gone we can go out. We’ve found that when we book out restaurants the staff want to join in with us.We have even appointed an events manager with the intention of having more gatherings.’’Mr Welch said the group now hopes to capitalise on its growing ranks, also helped by Britain\u0027s heatwave summer, by expanding its programme of activities and pursuits.He said: ‘‘We are working on things, we will be having outdoor camping events, we will be holding Nudefest and we will be taking over a hotel for a whole weekend.  You take your clothes off when you arrive and don’t have to put them back on until you leave.’’Mr Welch said the move to embrace events attracting mass crowds had been pivotal in the group\u0027s sudden surge in popularity.Last year British Naturism held its first NKD Festival, a clothes-free camping weekend aimed at younger people and families, in Dorset, which featured live entertainment in woodland surroundings.  ‘‘I have no doubt that the outdoor events have boosted our membership.  Our activities mean that anyone can participate.  It’s meant that we are more open, it’s not just about sunbathing anymore there are a lot of things going on,’’ Mr Welch added.However, despite the group\u0027s contention that naturism is becoming more accepted, those celebrating the human form do still at times face hostility.Earlier this year, Tate Britain was accused of unfairly discriminating against nudists after visitors from Eastbourne, East Sussex, attempted to arrange a tour to view the All Too Human show, which featured works by Lucien Freud and Francis Bacon Former computer analyst Philip Baker claimed he and fellow naturists had been \u0027stonewalled\u0027 by the London gallery after it did not respond to his repeated requests to set up a special visit.Life

which led to a 3 per cent hit to GDP and a recessionClick to followThe IndependentBrexit is already hurting the UK economy and crashing out of the European Union with no deal risks a recession, the government’s own independent official forecaster has concluded.“We cannot know for sure what would have happened had the vote gone the other way, but it seems likely that the economy and public finances have been weaker than they otherwise would have been,” said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in a new report published on Thursday.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look likeThe Bank of England and some independent analysts, including the Centre for European Reform, have suggested\u0026nbspthat the Leave result has held back UK GDP growth by between 2 and 2.5 per cent relative to where it otherwise would have been due to lower household spending, resulting from the spike in inflation after the vote, and lower business investment due to Brexit-related uncertainty.That equates to a GDP loss of up to\u0026nbsp£500m a week, more than what Brexit campaigners said,\u0026nbspmisleadingly,\u0026nbspwould be the benefit to UK tax revenues from no longer paying into the EU budget.The OBR described these calculations as plausible and in line with its own estimates, noting that the UK had slipped from having the highest growth rate in the G7 before the vote, to the lowest now.The OBR’s current growth forecasts are based on the UK achieving an orderly withdrawal process and 21-month transition period next March, during which Britain will remain in the single market and the customs union.It said that the economic consequences of a disorderly no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit next March, which some Brexiteers have been urging, were “next to impossible to calibrate with any confidence”.But it said perhaps the closest historical parallel was the “Three-Day Week”\u0026nbspin early 1974 in response to energy shortages and the threat of a miners’ strike which led to a 3 per cent hit to GDP and a recession.The OBR added that UK share prices could fall “sharply” in such a scenario.“Together with heightened uncertainty about future prospects, that would be likely to lead households and businesses to rein back their spending, while banks and other financial intermediaries would be likely to tighten the supply of credit, further reducing demand,” it said.Theresa May is proposing a free trade deal with the EU to be implemented when the post-Brexit transition phase ends in 2021, but has also insisted that “no-deal is better than a bad deal”.The OBR\u0026nbspalso poured cold water on the idea, promoted by Brexiteers, that any economic hit to the UK in a no-deal Brexit or hard Brexit (where we left the customs union entirely) could be cancelled out by major new free trade deals with other parts of the world.“As well as being challenging to negotiate, the evidence suggests that the benefits of additional bilateral trade deals are likely to be relatively modest – and the impact of any inidual deal may not be material for our forecast,” it said.Office for Budget ResponsibilityShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

He’s also a tennis coach.Dacre wasn’t always interested in following in his ancestor’s footsteps – his first love was sports (PA)But at some point, Dacre – who’s now 60 and lives in South Carolina – became fascinated with the brother of his great-grandfather George Stoker, so much so that he’s just co-authored his second book adding to Bram’s canon, a prequel to the most famous book about vampirism ever.But Dracul, published this month by Bantam Press, is not just about the early life of Count Dracula himself. It ties Bram Stoker inextricably into the Dracula legend and posits the fascinating question… what if Bram was producing not just a mere entertainment, but writing from experience?Cowriting with horror author JD Barker, Dacre presents Dracul partly in epistolary form, as the original book is laid out, intermingling the story of a terrified 21-year-old Bram locking himself away from a nightmare that haunts him, his only defences a gun, holy water and a crucifix, with fictionalised entries from Bram’s journal.The journal tells the story of Bram as a sickly child in Dublin, who is put in the care of a sinister nanny and ultimately crosses paths with the children of the night, experiences which would later inform his 1897 novel that has, in real life, become one of the most enduring stories of the past century.It’s great fun, told with aplomb by the two authors, and is weighted with an often uneasy sense of credibility, despite the subject matter, which is all thanks to Dacre’s direct connection to Bram, and the meticulous research he’s carried out into his ancestor’s writings.“Bram became quite a sportsman later in life,” says Dacre. “He was a very sickly child. Imagine if this transformation was due to an infusion of vampire’s blood…”Dacre is currently on a tour of the US promoting Dracul, and when we speak he is in New Orleans, itself considered the haunt of vampires and the quiet undead. It is very early in the day for him, before 7am, but he assures me he is an early riser. Across the road from his hotel is, he tells me, the Lafayette Cemetery, lair of the Mayfair vampires and deadly Lestat in Anne Rice’s celebrated novels. Dacre has become quite the expert on the undead. So how did the sports-mad teen gravitate towards less earthly pursuits?“I think it was when I read In Search of Dracula, a book by two Boston scholars, that I first really felt a connection to Bram and the story of Dracula,” he says. The book, by Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally, was published in 1972 and first made the connections between the fictional Count Dracula and the very real and bloody historical figure of Vlad Tepes of Wallachia.His interest piqued, Dacre began to speak to his cousins and other surviving relatives. “There aren’t many of us,” he says. “Although Bram was one of seven children, not many of them had families of their own.” He pauses. “Fortunately, George, my great-grandfather, did.”In 2003, Dacre was contacted by a screenwriter called Ian Holt, who had been trying to get a film made of a direct sequel to Dracula, but without much success. The pair teamed up and wrote the story as a novel, Dracula the Un-Dead, set 25 years after the original novel. As well as having the sway of an actual Stoker family member involved, the book served to help bring Dracula back into Stoker hands since the 1890 novel the character had become a bit of a pop-cultural free-for-all, and prompted the family to set up the Bram Stoker Estate, which Dacre manages.But the story took an unexpected turn in 2011 when Noel Dobbs, Bram’s great-grandson, discovered hidden away in his home on the Isle of Wight a previously unseen journal kept by the great writer.“That was a pivotal moment for me,” says Dacre. “With Dr Elizabeth Miller I set about deciphering the handwritten entries and from that journal I got to know Bram a lot more intimately. That was probably the most significant point in my relationship with Bram.”Dacre and Dr Miller published the contents of the journal in 2012, and as well as offering an insight into the life and thoughts of the author, it also set Dacre on another journey that would lead to the writing of the new book, Dracul.The journal alerted Dacre to the existence of a preface written by Bram to the original edition of Dracula that was never used by his publishers… and one which suggested that the author might have actually believed in vampires.Dacre – becoming, as he says, a “forensic literary detective” – tracked down the original preface to an Icelandic translation of Dracula and eventually finding a copy of that, something became startlingly apparent. “I believe that Bram realised that many people in history truly believed that vampires were real,” he says. “After Dracula was published, he gave just one interview and in that he said his book ‘touches on mystery and fact’.“We know now that long ago people might not have understood things like the plague or communicable diseases, and these unexplained things might have seemed supernatural to them. I believe Bram was very open-minded, and believed that just because we can’t observe something, it doesn’t mean that it can’t exist.”Dacre quotes from the original Dracula to me, from the scene when Van Helsing is trying to convince Dr Seward that there are things out there beyond human ken. “There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one.”Dacre cowrote ‘Dracul’ with horror author JD Barker (Penguin)From all this, Dacre extrapolated the plot of Dracul, of a young Bram coming into contact with vampirism, and writing Dracula as a result. “Not as a piece of fiction,” says Dacre, “but as a warning to the world.”When the idea was germinating, Dacre met JD Barker, whose debut novel Forsaken was nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for horror fiction. They agreed to collaborate on the idea, with Dacre taking Barker up to his cabin in North Carolina to thrash out the plot. The wisdom of accepting an offer from Bram Stoker’s blood relative to spend time alone in a remote cabin briefly flits across my mind as something to be embarked upon with care, but I don’t voice it, instead asking Dacre what Bram would think of the result.“I really do think he would approve,” he says. “I wanted to show the character of Bram evolve into a hero. He never really liked talking about himself and I think he would like the idea of a relative of his telling the story of his humble beginnings.”As well as managing the Stoker Estate and writing his own books based on Bram’s work, Dacre spends a lot of time attending scholarly conferences and is a regular attendee at the goth weekend in Whitby, where Bram holidayed in 1890 and first got the idea for Dracula. In the book, it is where the vampiric count makes landfall on the ill-fated ship the Demeter. The image of the Demeter crashing into the beach after Dracula has helped himself to most of the crew was based on a true story Bram was told by the fishermen on the harbour, about the Dmitry which beached at Whitby in 1885.Bran Castle: Dracula\u0027s home to be rented out over HalloweenRadu Florescu: Historian who was the first to make the link betweenSherlock\u0027s Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat announce new projectIf Bram Stoker kept an open mind about the real existence of vampires, what about his great grandnephew? “I keep an open mind about a lot of things, too,” he says. What would he do if he met an actual vampire?“I did!” he declares. “Last night! And not just one. There are now people who practise what they call ‘safe vampirism’. They share blood. I was invited to go along to one of their private clubs last night…”Quite what Bram Stoker would have made of that, we can only guess. But my interview with Dacre is at an end. The sun is just beginning to rise, and I wouldn’t want to keep him any longer. Because you just never know for sure…‘Dracul’ by Dacre Stoker and JD Barker\u0026nbspis published on 18 October by Bantam Press, £12.99Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Here, she talks about the project from its roots to its record breaking successesClick to followThe IndependentCher duets with Andy Garcia in a show-stealing scene from the upbeat sequelBack in 1982, I was working with Benny Andersson and Björn\u0026nbspUlvaeus on Chess. I was employed\u0026nbspas Tim Rice’s assistant. Abba had just disbanded and my first job was to go to meet Björn from the airport. I’d always loved the Abba songs but that was when I fell in love with them. Meeting Benny and Björn\u0026nbspand working with them over the next five years, I became extremely interested in those songs, which I think they thought they had left behind, as they were working on other musical projects.When I was younger, I was an Abba fan but I was more into Bowie, and I went through the rock phase of the\u0026nbspLed Zeppelins and the Emerson, Lake and Palmers. I loved “Dancing Queen”\u0026nbspbut I never went to an Abba concert.Mamma Mia 2 star Cher takes a chance on selling her Beverly Hills homeWhy ‘Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again’ is our antidote to BrexitLily James on playing a young Meryl Streep, and singing Abba for AbbaAll the ABBA songs featured in Mamma Mia 2Yet\u0026nbspI was compelled by the songs and by meeting the guys. The song “The Winner Takes it All” was the inspiration for Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspand when I met Björn I wanted to know what must have been going round in his head when he wrote that song.It’s a huge romancebreakup song\u0026nbspa woman having a conversation in her head with a man who has hurt her and let her down or maybe cheated on her. “Tell me does she kiss,\u0026nbsplike\u0026nbspI used to kiss you?” The lyrics are full of hurt it’s a roller coaster of emotions. But how do you make a musical out of a song that is taking you towards Greek tragedy? That’s what I love about Abba songs. They take you on this journey, and even if they hit a certain emotional spot, you’re still left feeling in a good mood.I felt the idea of hearing somebody sing that song in the theatre was like “Don’t Cry For Me Argentina”\u0026nbspit was “the 11 o’clock number “ as they say on Broadway –\u0026nbspthe second act showstopper.Benny and Björn were against anything that would be a tribute or a biographical story but that\u0026nbspdidn’t interest me either. Björn was interested at first more than Benny because the musical was to use\u0026nbsphis lyrics as the source material. Those amazing words took us through the stage show and now two films.It was funny working on the second film because people would say:\u0026nbsp“Are there enough songs?”\u0026nbspI certainly thought there were, and, in fact, I think there’s a whole new audience that didn’t know Abba, didn’t grow up with Abba, didn’t know them as a band and yet\u0026nbspknow those songs as Mamma Mia! That tickles Benny and Björn quite a lot.The girls haven’t been so involved because Benny and Björn wrote the songs. But Frida has always been very supportive. And Agnetha too for that matter.Of course, I was passionate and keen about the show, but I had to work hard to convince people that it wasn’t just a\u0026nbspperformance in which\u0026nbsppeople were going to be dressing up as Frida and Agnetha, and Benny and Björn.I knew those songs worked for two generations. For the younger audience members there was “Honey Honey” and “Dancing Queen”, the dancing songs. And then there’s the\u0026nbspmore emotional breakup songs, perhaps for older fans. I toyed with different ideas\u0026nbspthen in the mid-Nineties, Björn\u0026nbsptold me that\u0026nbspif I could\u0026nbspfind the right story\u0026nbsphe and Benny\u0026nbspmight be interested.That’s when I met playwright Catherine Johnson and pitched all my thoughts to her about generations, and how the theme of the production\u0026nbsphad to be weddings or holidays. I felt it had to be something nostalgic that took you to a happy place and Catherine\u0026nbspcame up with the genius mother-daughter idea\u0026nbspset around a wedding, and examining the relationship between a\u0026nbspmother and a daughter\u0026nbsp– and\u0026nbspthree possible fathers. And that immediately appealed to Björn and Benny.I hadn’t thought at that stage of the possibility of it becoming a film – I thought it might make a small TV film. But I always had a pull towards a stage show. And now I’ve overseen\u0026nbsp50 productions.The stakes were high because Mamma Mia! had done 20 years in London\u0026nbspand the first movie had been one of the most successful musical films ever.I had seen Love Actually. I adored Richard Curtis’s work. If we were to do another film we had to explore different emotions, and he is so brilliant not just at romance but also taking risks on life and loss: at the heart of all his comedies is\u0026nbsploss. He thought about this in the sense of going back and forth and to different places,\u0026nbspand all he had to say to me was “The Godfather: Part II” and I completely got it.You have to have ‘Dancing Queen’. Why would you go to see your favourite band if they’re not going to play your favourite songs?Even the music is like The Godfather: Part II\u0026nbsprich sweeping ballads. It underscores. There’s a rich palate of Abba in there.It was always the intention to reuse songs from the first film. You have to have “Dancing Queen”. Why would you go to see your favourite band if they’re not going to play your favourite songs?There were songs that I knew still had the power of storytelling and also the power of comedy,\u0026nbspsomething fun that has come from the stage show,\u0026nbspwhether it’s “Chiquitita” or “Take a Chance”.\u0026nbspBrosnan (PA)Curtis said he loved Mamma Mia! and\u0026nbspAbba\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspand though he didn’t have time to write the screenplay\u0026nbsphimself, he\u0026nbspwas happy to support our endeavours, especially if there was a writer he liked and wanted to work with. That person was Ol Parker, who came on board as a writer at that time (and then later became the director).So, it was a matter of making the story work.\u0026nbspMeryl Streep\u0026nbsphad always been affectionate towards the original\u0026nbspMamma Mia! and was keen on being in a possible\u0026nbspsequel but I knew she was never\u0026nbspgoing to take on a role as big as the first one. And for her to be part of it, what song? You can’t really top “The Winner Takes it All” from the first film, and she wasn’t going to be running along rooftops and jumping off cliffs singing lots of Abba songs. “My Love, My Life” is an incredibly affecting song and I think equal to “The Winner Takes it All”.Created with Sketch.ABBA: Eurovision victory in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Abba performs their song Waterloo during the Eurovision Song ContestAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA give the thumbs up after winning the Eurovision Song Contest with their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027ABBA posing at Waterloo railway station.Anna and Frida singing Sweden\u0027s entry, Waterloo, during a dress rehearsal in BrightonAbba meet a mounted policeman as they relax in Brighton, after their victory in the Eurovision Song ContestABBA in BrightonAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA during a photocall in London to promote their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027 before the Eurovision song contestBenny Andersson, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Faltskog and Bjorn Ulvaeus posing at Waterloo railway stationAbba strolling hand in hand amongst the daffodils in Hyde ParkAbba after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in BrightonAbba arriving at London Airport Abba performs their song Waterloo during the Eurovision Song ContestAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA give the thumbs up after winning the Eurovision Song Contest with their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027ABBA posing at Waterloo railway station.Anna and Frida singing Sweden\u0027s entry, Waterloo, during a dress rehearsal in BrightonAbba meet a mounted policeman as they relax in Brighton, after their victory in the Eurovision Song ContestABBA in BrightonAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA during a photocall in London to promote their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027 before the Eurovision song contestBenny Andersson, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Faltskog and Bjorn Ulvaeus posing at Waterloo railway stationAbba strolling hand in hand amongst the daffodils in Hyde ParkAbba after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in BrightonAbba arriving at London Airport I’m going to claim Cher as my idea, though Ol would probably also claim it as his.\u0026nbspI’ve always loved Cher\u0026nbspand had a conversation with her for the last movie before we cast Christine Baranski to see whether Cher would be interested in playing\u0026nbspTania then. She wasn’t, but she said to me recently it worked out well this way round.\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspalso felt that\u0026nbspif we were going to do a second film, well\u0026nbspwe had hit a high with Meryl on the first\u0026nbspand now we’d\u0026nbspgot to hit it out of the park. Who is one of the greatest actors who can sing? There’s Cher, there’s Bette\u0026nbspMidler and there’s Barbra Streisand. There was always going to be a mother character. Ol wrote the part\u0026nbspas the ultimate rock chick, and with Cher in mind. I was always fixated that Cher would be the perfect casting.Mamma Mia! has traditionally had great female roles that we lack in musical theatre and in movies and Cher really embraced it.\u0026nbspFor both films\u0026nbspwe cast brilliant actors. And\u0026nbspnow we\u0026nbsphave three generations, with Cher and Meryl Christine\u0026nbspBaranski\u0026nbspand Julie Walters\u0026nbspand Amanda Seyfried and the Lily James generation – and Cher gets the guy.“Fernando” was a favourite Abba song of hers and it was tempting for her to sing it.\u0026nbspI think with this film we could have a wink at the audience with how we use this old song, and it’s a brilliant moment when she and Andy Garcia (Fernando) discover each other again\u0026nbspand she tells that story through the power of her voice. You feel she was probably rebelling as a young woman in her early 20s, and then probably again when she was Donna Sheridan’s mum\u0026nbsphanging out at Studio 54 too much. And now we see her come back in her full glory as Ruby Sheridan – or as Cher, in fact.Saudi woman barred from marrying man ‘because he plays a instrument’Lily James on playing a young Meryl Streep, and singing Abba for AbbaAll the ABBA songs featured in Mamma Mia 2It was said that the last film\u0026nbspinvigorated people\u0026nbspand I think it probably did. We ran all summer, the summer of the financial crash, and it brought people of every age to the cinema. As a show we opened at the most tragic of all times in New York, the time of 911. You’ve got this massive show and one of the worst tragedies that you can imagine. How do you deal with that? With everyone involved\u0026nbspand the city in complete crisis, while people have\u0026nbspto keep going and\u0026nbspearn a living?It was a difficult time but the then-mayor, Rudy Giuliani, was incredibly galvanising to the Broadway community. People asked us:\u0026nbsp“Are you still going to open?” The answer had to be “yes”.\u0026nbspEveryone thought about it a lot and I know Phyllida sat and talked to the cast when we were rehearsing, it was almost like a therapy. But it was the best thing for everyone to make the show happen.I don’t think there will be a “Mamma Mia 3!”. It’s great that people are thinking that way I think people feel very safe with Mamma Mia! and this new movie has a lot more emotional heft, and it really makes you laugh and cry:\u0026nbspit’s a shared experience. And those songs, of course. They said, back when the show opened: “Oh people don’t always know those Abba songs.”\u0026nbspBut now “When I Kissed the Teacher”\u0026nbsp– the opening song on the movie – has\u0026nbspbeen\u0026nbsptrending on Spotify.Mamma Mia! was way before social media in the case of the stage show even the first\u0026nbspmovie came out before social media was the force it is now. Today, it’s a massive tool for marketing and communication, enabling us to\u0026nbspappeal to a younger audience. So it’s fascinating that I see on social media\u0026nbspa younger audience going:\u0026nbsp“Please do ‘Mamma Mia 3’.” That’s the natural thing for them.One person even said: “Why can’t it become the new Fast and Furious?”\u0026nbsp– that made me laugh a lot.Judy Craymer was talking to David Lister“MAMMA MIA!

Stepping into Julie Andrews’s formidable shoes, Blunt has promised to deliver a new take on the character – one that still pays tribute to Andrews’s\u0026nbspperformance, but draws more heavily from the version of Poppins we see in P.L. Travers’s source books. “She’s a little meaner,” Blunt teased.Lin-Manuel Miranda as Jack: The adult protégé of Burt (played by Dick Van Dyke in the 1964 original), is not a chimney sweep this time, but a “leerie” – a person who rides around on a bicycle\u0026nbspwith a ladder\u0026nbspto light the street lamps of London, then douses them in the morning.New Mary Poppins Returns trailer sees Emily Blunt singing and dancingJulie Andrews on why she won\u0027t appear in Mary Poppins ReturnsBen Whishaw as Michael: The grown-up version of Matthew Garber’s character from the 1964 film, Michael still lives in the same house on Cherry Tree Lane, and has followed in his father’s footsteps by working as a banker at the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank in London. Michael has three children, though it’s been implied his wife has recently died, putting the family in a crisis.Emily Mortimer as Jane: The grown-up version of Karen Dotrice’s character from the 1964 film, Jane has inherited her mother’s suffragette spirit, working as a union organiser.Julie Walters as Ellen: Employed as Michael’s housekeeper, Ellen will surely find herself involved in Mary’s antics.Created with Sketch.The best films of 2018 (so far) Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama.

It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 716 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.816 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism.

I really want her to take this and run with it, because she will be brilliant.\u0027The film has Andrews’s full approval, however, as Marshall added: “She had known it was in the works, then we said, ‘We’re doing it,’ and she said, ‘Oh, thank god.’ Then we said, ‘And we’re thinking of Emily Blunt,’ and she just threw her hands up in the air and said yes. I think a lot of people feel that way about Emily’s work.The film, directed and produced by Rob Marshall, best known for Chicago and Into the Woods, brings the story forward to the era of the Great Depression, with a now grown-up Jane and Michael Banks living in their old house. After the death of Michael’s wife leaves him as a single father to three children, and throws their world into chaos, the Banks’s former nanny makes a return visit, with the help of lamplighter Jack.While 1964’s Mary Poppins draws mainly from the first book in P L Travers’s eight-part Mary Poppins series, the sequel focuses on an original story, which draws elements from several of the books.Mary Poppins Returns is an all-out musical, including new songs written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, best known for the Broadway musicals Hairspray and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and an original score by Shaiman. There will also be dance numbers, including one which takes place on the streets of London, set to the new song “Trip a Little Light Fantastic”.The film features several sequences that, much like the original’s “Jolly Holiday” segment, place live actors into an animated world. One sequence will see Mary and the children e into a bathtub and arrive in an underwater world, while another has them jump into a Royal Doulton bowl.Mary Poppins Returns will be released in UK cinemas on 21 December.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

has said.The consumer group said the government\u0027s preparations for a no-deal exit suggested a reduction in consumer rights and choice as well as price hikes that would have a “direct and hard” impact in areas ranging from travel to food and energy.The watchdog, which based its conclusions on its assessment of the government\u0027s technical notices in preparation for the event of a no-deal Brexit, online forums and surveys, said two in five people did not understand the potential implications of a no-deal scenario.Health department cannot guarantee \u0027supply of medicines\u0027 after BrexitIn its report - Brexit no deal: a consumer catastrophe? - Which? says: “Our latest consumer research shows that most people are unprepared for what \u0027no deal\u0027 would mean in practice - and many do not understand how it would have multiple impacts across so many aspects of their daily lives.“When the everyday repercussions and government\u0027s plans on issues such as food and medical supplies were explained to people in our research, many people were shocked and questioned why they had not been made aware of the implications sooner.”A survey for the watchdog found three quarters of people thought it was likely a no-deal Brexit would lead to higher prices for food and other items (76 per cent) and delays at the border for travellers and holidaymakers (75 per cent).McVey refuses to back May\u0027s Brexit plan ahead of crunch cabinet talksBrexit running on ‘naivety’, says former UK ambassador to EUTheresa May faces ministers as DUP threaten alliance over BrexitThree quarters (75 per cent) also thought no deal would make it harder to resolve an issue with a faulty product bought online from an EU-based business, while 70 per cent believed it would be more difficult to rely on protections in a European country if travel companies collapse.Which? director of policy Caroline Normand said: “Consumers want a Brexit that protects and enhances their rights and gives them access to a wider range of high-quality, affordable goods and services.“But it\u0027s clear that many are deeply concerned about what a no-deal Brexit would mean for families and businesses across Britain.“From grounded flights and delays at borders and airports, to food shortages and soaring energy prices, the impact could be immediate and catastrophic for millions of people, with disruption on a scale not seen since the consumer chaos of the 1970s.“The Government must agree a deal with the European Union to prevent a disaster scenario for consumers that hits them in the pocket and sees valuable rights effectively snatched away from them.”Populus surveyed 2,056 UK adults online between August 3-5 and 2,100 UK adults online between 19-20 September.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

With that, they appear to take the information with them, but it cannot simply be lost without breaking the laws of quantum mechanics.But the new paper suggests that can be explained by the phenomenon of soft hair. That is a sort of glossy edge\u0026nbspthat sits at the edge of the black hole and allows for scientists to overcome the paradox.Hawking memorial sees professor\u0027s voice shot into a black holeNow the researchers who worked with Professor Hawking on the paper in his final days will have to explore more of how exactly that works without him. They hope to find out how exactly the soft hair works, and what happens to it when the black hole comes to an end.The study itself – which is attributed to\u0026nbspSasha Haco, Stephen W. Hawking, Malcolm J. Perry and\u0026nbspAndrew Strominger –\u0026nbspdescribes that process in far more technical detail. The summary concludes with a sentence that reads: Assuming the existence of a quantum Hilbert space on which these charges generate the symmetries, as well as the applicability of the Cardy formula, the central charges reproduce the macroscopic area-entropy law for generic Kerr black holes.But at its most simple level it could be part of a solution to a problem that has occupied many of the greatest minds in the world for decades, according to researchers.“Understanding the microscopic origin of this entropy – what are the underlying quantum states that the entropy counts? – has been one of the great challenges of the last 40 years,\u0026nbspMarika Taylor, professor of theoretical physics at Southampton University and a former student of Hawking’s, told , which had first reported the new paper.This paper proposes a way to understand entropy for astrophysical black holes based on symmetries of the event horizon. The authors have to make several non-trivial assumptions so the next steps will be to show that these assumptions are valid.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Users can go on holiday to France and still have full access to the\u0026nbspNetflix films and Spotify\u0026nbspmusic they get at home, for instance.But a tranche of newly-released official\u0026nbspdocuments about the anticipated impact of a no-deal Brexit includes a paper that suggests the portability\u0026nbsparrangement that exists with the bloc would “cease to apply”.Created with Sketch.

But when they do so they will most likely see the library of the country they are in, as happens if Britons travel outside of the European Union now.“UK Netflix subscribers are able to access Netflix everywhere in the world Netflix is available and will continue to do so once the UK leaves the EU,” a Netflix spokesperson said. The company said that “local catalogues vary due to licensing and local tastes”, but pointed out its original shows are available everywhere.The new papers also make clear that the same regulations would apply to geo-blocking regulation. That ensures that people can buy from online services across the continent, without being punished for doing so from another country.“Following repeal of the Geo-Blocking Regulation in the UK, traders from the UK, EU and third countries would not be prohibited from discriminating between EU customers and UK customers,” the papers say.“For instance a UK trader would be able to offer different terms to a UK customer compared to a French customer.”Companies based in the UK and selling products and services in the EU\u0026nbspwill still have to comply with the regulation, to ensure that they don’t discriminate between people in different countries within Europe.The new geo-blocking rules go into effect in December 2018, meaning that they will apply to UK citizens for about\u0026nbspthree months before a possible no-deal Brexit in March 2019.The paper covering ‘Geo-blocking of online content if there’s no Brexit deal’ and another covering portability of content\u0026nbspis one of a range of papers released in the latest set of documents from the UK government. They also include new documents showing Britain could no longer benefit from deals that represent a significant portion of UK trade and that train journeys into and out of the EU could be disrupted.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But, as part of ongoing austerity measures, they have been frozen since April 2016, resulting in a decline in\u0026nbsptheir real term value while inflation rises.Now, if this year’s inflation reaches the predicted 2.7 per cent when revealed on Wednesday, it will mean the worth of working age benefits has fallen by an astonishing 6.4 per cent over the last four years.The foundation says some 10 million people will be affected, and called on the government to use the upcoming budget to cancel the freeze.Adam Corlett, its senior economic analyst, said: While the prime minister this week repeated her claim that austerity is over, significant cuts in support for millions of low-income families are set to continue next year as a result of the ongoing freeze in working age benefits.The budget represents a last chance to cut short the benefit freeze. Scrapping it would send a strong signal that, from the perspective of low-income families, the government is committed to ending austerity.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves hit Cawsand, Cornwall as Storm Callum arrives to the UKFormer Prime Minister John Major has spoken out against the launch of Universal Credit (the Government\u0027s new benefit model).

But the warning says that if this does not happen, horses could not be taken into the bloc.EU certification would require more work by vets to confirm the absence of disease, the paper notes, which could cost up to £500 more if blood tests are needed, depending which category the UK was placed in.Created with Sketch.Tories at war: Boris Johnson \u0027suicide vest\u0027 Brexit jibe causes ide Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Internal isions in the Conservative Party have exploded into a bitter public row over Boris Johnson‘s “disgusting” criticism of Theresa May.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, rebuked his former cabinet colleague and said: “I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences.”But other MPs leapt to Mr Johnson’s defence, as iding lines ahead of a possible leadership contest begin to take shape. The Uxbridge MP has repeatedly criticised Ms May’s Chequers plan and used a newspaper article on Sunday to suggest it amounted to “wrapping a suicide vest around the British constitution”. His latest salvo at the prime minister prompted immediate condemnation, with one minister publicly vowing to end Mr Johnson’s career over the matterAlan Duncan, a foreign minister who worked in Mr Johnson’s team for two years, wrote on Twitter: “For Boris to say the PM’s view is like that of a suicide bomber is too much. This marks one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics. Housing secretary James Brokenshire added his voice to the criticism, calling Mr Johnson’s comments ”wrong”But as Tory hostilities spilled over into open public warfare, Richmond Park MP Zac Goldsmith, an ally of Mr Johnson, hit back at Mr Duncan.Senior Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Independent he thought Mr Johnson’s “suicide belt” accusation was little more than “a characteristically colourful catchphrase”.Nadine Dorries, another Brexit supporter, said Mr Johnson’s opponents were “terrified of his popular appeal”, adding: “Don’t underestimate the vitriol that’ll be directed towards Boris today.

The Uxbridge MP has repeatedly criticised Ms May’s Chequers plan and used a newspaper article on Sunday to suggest it amounted to “wrapping a suicide vest around the British constitution”. His latest salvo at the prime minister prompted immediate condemnation, with one minister publicly vowing to end Mr Johnson’s career over the matterAlan Duncan, a foreign minister who worked in Mr Johnson’s team for two years, wrote on Twitter: “For Boris to say the PM’s view is like that of a suicide bomber is too much. This marks one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics. Housing secretary James Brokenshire added his voice to the criticism, calling Mr Johnson’s comments ”wrong”But as Tory hostilities spilled over into open public warfare, Richmond Park MP Zac Goldsmith, an ally of Mr Johnson, hit back at Mr Duncan.Senior Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Independent he thought Mr Johnson’s “suicide belt” accusation was little more than “a characteristically colourful catchphrase”.Nadine Dorries, another Brexit supporter, said Mr Johnson’s opponents were “terrified of his popular appeal”, adding: “Don’t underestimate the vitriol that’ll be directed towards Boris today. He delivered the Leave vote, Remainers and wannabe future PMs hate him.”Andrew Bridgen said Ms May was to blame for her leadership problems.Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, warned Ms May the Conservatives faced a catastrophic split if she did not jettison her Chequers plan.The deep isions on the Tory benches were laid bare as Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee and is a possible leadership rival to Mr Johnson, also hit out at the former foreign secretary.Alistair Burt, another Foreign Office minister who worked in Mr Johnson’s team, said: “I’m stunned at the nature of this attack.

The goods will therefore need to be checked as they enter the UK,” they say.The Food Standards Agency plans to require all importers of high-risk food and feed from the EU to warn them using a new UK import notification system.All the new guidance documents have the caveat: “This notice is meant for guidance only. You should consider whether you need separate professional advice before making specific preparations.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

condemned the “shambolic” prospect of a no-deal exit – warning of higher shop prices and a huge loss of jobs, if tariffs were imposed.And the British Chamber of Commerce said it underlined the need for the UK and EU to break the deadlock “as soon as possible, to avoid the confusion and significant disruption of a no deal scenario”.The UK boasts around 40 free trade agreements, with more than 70 countries, because it is an EU member, including the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey and NorwayThey give businesses “a range of preferential market access opportunities”, including cheaper import tariffs and duties and more relaxed “rules of origin” requirements.The deals also provide “enhanced market access” for services, “public procurement opportunities” and “improved protections for

general election because activists are “demoralised” by Theresa May’s leadership and fear defeat, a party insider has revealed.The number of applications is “down on previous years across the board”, the prime minister has been warned – even as the turmoil at Westminster cuts the odds on a snap poll.Some branches in target seats have been forced to postpone decisions, despite pressure to get candidates in place early, the executive editor of the ConservativeHome website said.May clash with Raab over customs ‘time limit’ threatens deal hopesThe warning comes as the Democratic Unionist Party’s threat to pull its backing for the Tories\u0026nbspin a bitter clash over Brexit\u0026nbspleaves the government’s future in growing doubt.Without the DUP, Ms May lacks a majority and – if unable to pass a budget – will face demands to accept she is unable to govern and must stand down.Mark Wallace, the ConservativeHome editor, wrote: “The number of applications submitted to stand in the new contests is down on previous years across the board.“Some constituency associations have received applications only numbering in the ‘single figures’\u0026nbspwhere they would previously have expected scores.”Mr Wallace pointed to the debacle of the 2017 election as a likely cause, adding: “Last year’s grim experience certainly demoralised and deterred various candidates.“Some have given up entirely, and many more are less eager to be a willing horse for the party as a result of their mistreatment.”There was also widespread “pessimism about the next election”, with only about one-third of party members expecting an outright Conservative victory.Created with Sketch.Conservative Conference: Tories line up to denounce Boris Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

based on the so-called Chequers agreement - at a summit in Salzburg.The Irish border issue remains the biggest hurdle still to overcome, but a shift in the UK\u0026rsquos position over the \u0026lsquobackstop\u0026rsquo contingency plan has opened the door to a possible deal at next week\u0026rsquos European Council summit.But the Prime Minister will be forced into a delicate balancing act in the coming days as she attempts to address calls by Brexiteers in her Conservative Party, who are pushing for a clean break from Brussels, while keeping her unionist allies in Northern Ireland happy.Mrs May relies on votes from the Democratic Unionists (DUP) to maintain her slim majority in the Commons but the party\u0026rsquos leader Arlene Foster said the DUP would stand by its red line on the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK come what may.READ MORE: Theresa May releases 29 NO DEAL Brexit consequences on BritainFollowing the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos disastrous performance in 2017\u0027s snap election, she negotiated a \u0026lsquoconfidence and supply\u0026rsquo deal with Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos party, which traded \u0026pound1billion in extra funding for Northern Ireland for support from the DUP on key issues.Mrs May could attempt to secure the unionist votes she needs to force a deal through the Commons by offering more money - potentially tens of millions of pounds - in exchange for support for her plans.But a senior DUP policymaker told the Daily  that money will not solve the problem.They said: Money to sip poison to the Union slowly isn\u0027t exactly a great offer.Brexit news: Theresa May could secure a draft exit deal next week (Image:  IMAGES)The Prime Minister is trying to keep the DUP and Brexiteers happy while pursuing her Brexit plans (Image: REUTERS)                \u0027Never agree!\u0027 May to REFUSE Brexit deal trapping UK under EU rule                \u0027Theresa May needs to go NOW\u0027 Brexiteer demands she resign IMMEDIATELYTory Brexiteers have been calling for Mrs May to change tack on her plans for the spilt since she revealed her Chequers blueprint in July.And her proposals for the Irish backstop, which would see the entire UK continue to abide by the EU\u0026rsquos customs union rules, have been condemned for having the potential to keep Britain shackled to Brussels for years to come.One possible solution for Mrs May would be to strike an agreement with the EU that both sides will have the\u0026nbspability to jointly agree when they are ready to move to the new deal.But this could be a non-starter because of the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos commitment to ensuring there are no trade barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain after Brexit - and a customs union is the only feasible option at this late stage.Mrs May relies on the 10 votes provided Arlene Foster\u0027s DUP to maintain a Commons majority (Image: EPA)A potentially more workable option would see Mrs May focus on the future UK-EU trading arrangement.The Irish backstop will only kick in if other terms are not agreed, so the PM could put all of her energy into securing an ambitious trade deal which leaves the door open to technological solutions in the future.The prospect of eventually developing an \u0026lsquoinvisible\u0026rsquo border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic may be enough to keep both Brexiteers and the DUP happy, though Brussels has already poured cold water on the customs plans in Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers deal.Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, 2019, but Brussels has agreed to an 18-month transition period designed to give businesses the chance to adapt.Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg would likely resist attempts to extend the transition period (Image:  IMAGES)On the current timetable, the transition will end on December 31, 2020.But the Prime Minister could request an extension to buy more time to negotiate a trade deal with the EU, removing the need for the backstop and placating the DUP.However this option would likely go down badly with Brexiteers who have warned any extension of the transition could pave the way for the UK remaining tied to Brussels indefinitely.If these softer approaches fall flat, Mrs May could be forced into a showdown with the Brexiteers and the DUP.

Thirty Conservative MPs gang together to DEMAND another Brexit voteThe experts behind the report, produced by UCL\u0026rsquos Constitution Unit, acknowledged the prospect of a so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote is contentious but said it would be perfectly achievable given the political will.The in-depth study examined exactly how a second referendum could come about, its legal implications and what sort of question would be most suitable.It also considered potential timelines of a second vote, with the report authors warning a minimum of 22 weeks would be needed to prepare the ballot - and even longer if the public were asked a \u0026lsquomulti-choice\u0026rsquo question.The authors found Brexit could be delayed by at least six months in a scenario where the Prime Minister secures an exit deal and wins the backing of MPs but her EU Withdrawal Bill is held up by the House of Lords.Brexit news: Any second referendum would delay Britain\u0027s planned exit from the EU, research shows (Image:  IMAGES)A second Brexit referendum would take at least 22 weeks to prepare, the study found (Image:  IMAGES)If the House of Lords demanded a second vote, the referendum may not take place until September 2019 (Image:  IMAGES)                Brexit second referendum will NOT set precedent for Scotland                \u0027Brexit BULLY boys!\u0026rsquo Soubry claims she will not be DROWNED outIn this scenario, if peers demanded the public have a final say on whether to leave with the deal, leave without a deal or stop Brexit and remain in the EU, a referendum would not take place until September at the earliest.If the electorate then opted to leave with the deal negotiated by Mrs May, the 18-month transition period keeping Britain tied to the EU would begin in six months later than planned.During the transition, which under the Government\u0026rsquos current timetable would end on December 31, 2020, the UK will be bound by Brussels\u0026rsquo rules but have no say over the drafting of new ones.In a scenario where a second referendum does not take place until September, the transition would run until mid-2021 - meaning the UK could be chained to the EU for almost another three years.Assuming the UK is able to strike an exit deal with the EU, Mrs May will still be faced with a series of major obstacles before it becomes law.Parliament has demanded a \u0026lsquomeaningful vote\u0026rsquo on the orce deal, and the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos slim majority - plus her reliance on votes from her unionist allies in Northern Ireland - means she could fall at the first hurdle.But even if her Brexit plan survives the meaningful vote, MPs could still insist the public be given a final say.Dr Alan Renwick, report co-author and Deputy Director of the Constitution Unit, said: \u0026ldquoThe principle of a further referendum on Brexit is likely to remain controversial, so it is of utmost importance that the process should command the maximum legitimacy.\u0026ldquoIf the result is to be accepted by those on all sides, every effort should be made to ensure the referendum campaign is fair, the poll is properly conducted, the options put to the referendum are clear, and the question allows voters to express their preferences unambiguously.Professor Meg Russell, report co-author and Director of the Constitution Unit, said: \u0026ldquoIn the British system anything is possible given the political will. The current level of interest in a further referendum on Brexit makes it vital that serious consideration is given to all possible scenarios, including which would work best and which would be most problematic.

The British people voted to take back control over money, laws borders and trade.It is understood that a number of ministers voiced concern at a meeting with the PM in Downing Street on Thursday that any such backstop could leave the UK in an open-ended customs union, preventing it from seeking trade deals elsewhere in the world.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has said it risks making the UK a permanent EU colony.Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond became the first senior Government figure to suggest that the backstop - designed to keep the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic open in the case that no broader EUUK trade deal is finalised - will probably have to come into effect for a period.But the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May\u0027s minority Conservative administration in the House of Commons, urged her to resist any initiatives from Brussels which might threaten the Union.DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said there would be consequences for Mrs May if she walked away from her promise to protect the Union.We are simply reminding her, you are being torn at the moment between what we believe are your gut instincts and your sound principles on the Union and at the same time the bullying, threatening behaviour of the EU, said Mr Wilson at a meeting of DUP MPs and Assembly members in Portadown.Go with your principles, go with your instinct, go with your responsibility to the people of the UK and show the EU negotiators the door.BREXIT negotiations: Theresa May and European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (Image: EMMANUEL DUNANDAFPGetty Images)Mrs May chaired a meeting of the inner Cabinet on Brexit progress Mrs May set out in June proposals for a temporary customs arrangement to ensure that the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic remains open in the case that no broader EUUK trade agreement has been finalised.The document stated that the UK Government expects this arrangement to remain in place no later than the end of December 2021.But the EU is mounting resistance to any specific time limit being included in the text of the UK\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement, while Leave-backing ministers are understood to be insistent that the end of the arrangement should be more precisely defined than the vague term temporary.Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, who was not at the Downing Street meeting, pointedly refused to endorse the Prime Minister\u0027s Chequers blueprint for Brexit.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and the Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom - who, like Ms McVey, both backed Leave in the referendum in 2016 - were also said to harbour deep concerns.A number of ministers, including Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, were said to have raised concerns over the backstop issue during the 90-minute meeting.\u0026nbsp            "},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/1030862_1.jpg","title":"Brexit news Theresa May extend EU transition period backstop Jacob Rees Mogg Brexiteers","story":"Currently, the UK is due to formally leave the EU on March 19 next year but will remain in a so-called \u0026lsquotransition period\u0026rsquo until the end of 2020.However, according to provocative reports in The Daily  the Prime Minister is considering extending the period for another year, until the close of 2021.The extension would mean the UK paying the EU billions of pounds more for continued access to the single market, whilst implementing a large portion of Brussels made laws without a formal vote on their passing.It\u0026rsquos been estimated the extra year tied to Brussels could cost the UK \u0026pound17billion.

And I still can’t believe it.In March last year, a jihadi went on a rampage in Westminster.Then he smashed into the perimeter fence and entered New Palace Yard, a few dozen feet away from where our politicians were gathered.Armed with a kne, he attacked anyone he saw. He murdered PC Keith Palmer.And now the thing that beggars belief. At that very moment, the acting commissioner of the politan Police, Craig Mackey, was leaving the scene in a car. He was inches away from Masood.He was only a few feet away when the Islamic terrorist was busy stabbing his colleague, PC Palmer.He watched the stabbing take place. And what did he do  He drove off, sharpish, having locked the windows of his car.He told an inquest into the murder: “I was in shirt-sleeves with no radio. We had no protective equipment.“The way the male came in, he was clearly a threat.“The attacker had one of those looks where,they get you in that look, they would be after you.”So he skedaddled as fast as he could, actually driving right past Masood.It has a Monty Python ring to it.“When danger reared its ugly head, Sir Craig bravely turned and fled . . .”How, I wondered, could he possibly do that  I thought one of the requirements for being a copper was a certain bravery and, you know, a vague interest in apprehending criminals Also, Masood seemed a bit nasty. He had “one of those looks”.No s**t, Sherlock. This is cowardice and, to my mind, a gross dereliction of duty.At the very least, he could have opened the car door to distract the attacker.Nope, not Sir Craig. If he’d done something — anything — poor PC Palmer might be alive today. Various senior ex-coppers have called for Mackey to be booted out, right now. and stripped of his knighthood.Incidentally, he was bunged the knighthood in this year’s New Year’s honours, partly for hugely reducing the number of stop-and-searches in London. That’s what the lefties wanted at the time.They bleated that stop-and-search was racist. Craig was only too happy to oblige. Oh, the irony of it.It’s thought ending stop-and-search contributed to the jamboree of stabbings we have seen in London this year.You wonder how Mackey has lived with himself these last  months. And how he can possibly retain the respect of his less well-remunerated colleagues.But it tells you a lot about the way our police forces are run these days.Their political grandstanding on “hate-speech” issues.Their reluctance to engage in the dficult, nasty side of policing, such as stopping real villains going about their work.Resign, Sir Craig.At least salvage a little bit of dignity by doing that.She turns them all down because they were too small. Or not in a nice area. We even offered to bung her £, for a deposit on a home.Now the woman has sued her local authority for infringing her human rights.Listen, love, they’re not half as infringed as they would beI had my way.You’d be dropped from a plane into Aleppo . . . and you’d have to crowd-fund the parachute. WIND turbines are a blight on the landscape.They deliver very little energy for their monstrous size. And they act as a kind of huge Moulinex blender for all kinds of wild birds.Now the United Nations’ World Health Organisation has discovered still more flaws in these ludicrous contraptions. They can also cause heart problems, high blood pressure and tinnitus in humans.But because they are beloved by the gobby Green lobby, we’re going to have loads more of them.Marching across the country. Not generating very much electricity.And causing misery wherever they are.APPARENTLY William Shakespeare disliked women because one of them gave him a dose.This is according to a new study by someone who probably hasn’t got a Scooby.The theory is that Will copped syphilis off some unwholesome Tudor bint and this coloured his opinion towards women for ever.“Is this a dagger I see before me ”No, mate.

I’m told she used to be on it, or something.But I was struck by the photographs in The Sun yesterday of her ar*e.She was out shopping in Braintree, Essex. But you couldn’t see Braintree – or Harlow or Basildon. Just this humongous pair of buttocks, with Lauren Goodger’s head attached to them. Glowing slightly, like an autumn moon.When did British girls decide having an enormous ar*e was something to be proud of FROM the horse’s mouth: The low-skilled workers we have let into the country from the EU over the past ten years have been of no clear benefit to the country.Instead, they have had several “negative” impacts, such as depressing the wages of our poorest citizens.Further, they take more from the public purse than they contribute.Not me speaking but the head of the Government’s Migration Advisory Committee, Professor Alan Manning.THERE are very good reasons to eat less meat, or even none at all.Most of them are to do with animal welfare.But the stuff I’ve been hearing about the effect of meat-eating on climate change is beyond parody.The best thing we can do, we’re told, is switch to a vegetarian diet to lower emissions.So we need to import more lentils from Turkey, tomatoes from Italy and Spain, avocados from Colombia and quinoa from Peru How is this food going to get here And in what possible way is it better for the environment than eating a roast leg of lamb reared sustainably on the Cumbrian fells Climate change is a fact.But when they conflate two issues for reasons of fashion, I begin to smell a rat.A mate asked me to join him.I assumed it was a bit like dogging, except slightly weirder, so I was quite up for it.Turns out it’s jogging while picking up litter.So you lose weight and make the planet a bit nicer at the same time.We’ve imported the idea from Sweden, apparently.The people who run it are trying to get lots of schoolkids involved – soyou’re interested, check out Plogolution online and they’ll help you set up a team.THE fascist Left has been enjoying itself again – this time trolling a retired astronaut who quoted from Sir Winston Churchill.Scott Kelly used Churchill’s words “in victory, magnanimity” in a tweet. The moron hordes descended upon Kelly, pictured.They demanded he “educate himself”, saying Churchill was a racist, imperialist murderer. The usual rot.Kelly was forced to apologise, though he should never have done so. Sure, Churchill possessed a few views which today we would find a little, er, problematic. But there wasn’t a single statesman from his era who didn’t – and that includes Gandhi.Churchill saved the world from fascism.Why can’t these cretinous liberals get things in proportion Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whats to say they dont start appearing in our home They are dangerous creatures.Dad of two, Michael Adedayo, , whose son, , attends Star Primary school, told The Sun he was concerned about his son eventually ing to school.He said: I am very worried because I do not know what my son is going back into when it eventually re-opens.I am troubled that he and the other kids could be going back into danger. I dont know what is going on.I just trust they are doing their best to fix it. But who knows what will happen. It is certainly worrying me. How has it been allowed to spread like this Nighat Mahmood, , who lives by Eastleigh Community school, said she was very frightened.She added: The spiders could come into my house. It is terrying. I cant even open the windows Im so scared that the spiders could spread to my home.Huseyin Topal, , who runs the JD corner-shop by Star Lane school, said that the school closing has impacted his business badly.He said: kids and teachers are my main customers. We have had bad business recently. I am more worried about that than the spiders spreading here.False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.Millions of  widows, Britain’s most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing.The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about mm in size.Also known as ‘steatoda nobilis’, the spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom.Dr Deborah Turbitt, deputy director for Public Health London, said: “If you have been bitten, gently wash the affected area with soap and water.If symptoms don’t respond to these measures, there is severe swelling, or the bite is around the eyes, seek immediate medical attention.”A spokeswoman for Newham council said: Original estimates suggested schools would be closed for as long as three weeks, however by working closely with the schools, pest professionals and risk assessment experts we have minimised the impact on children’s learning and signicantly reduced the amount of time a school has had to close.Councillor Julianne Marriott, cabinet member for education, said: “No head teacher wants to be in a position where they have to close their school. Our head teachers know their schools and pupils best, and have their children’s welfare as top priority.They have not made these decisions lightly and we fully support the actions they’ve taken.  We have dferent types of schools comprising new buildings and old, which have  dferent number of spiders.  Our schools cater for pupils with a iety of dfering needs that they need to accommodate.The school closures have been of ying s of time based on the advice of pest control professionals and detailed risk assessments. Many of the affected schools are reopening next week and have worked with other schools, our colleges and sixth forms to ensure children continue to have access to education.”Mandeep Gill, Principal of New Vic College said: “We have been extremely happy to welcome the students and staff of local schools into NewVIc for classes and activities this week.This has been a real catalyst to bring the schools and colleges together. We all want the best for the young people of Newham and we are very committed to continuing to work together to build even stronger relationships between us.”A spokesman for the British Arachnological Society said: The bite of the False Widow is of minor medical signicance, comparable to common insect bites and stings.The distribution and abundance of the spider in the community around the school should be taken into account.It is likely that the spider is present in urban and suburban southeast England in all suitable habitats.One mother, who did not want to be named and who lives by Star Lane described the situation as horrendous.She added: It is absolutely awful. I work full time, so it has made le a nightmare as Ive suddenly got to find child care. And the thought of the spiders being so near is terrying!Another young mother, who also did not want to be named and lives by Godwin Junior school, called on Newham Counil to do more.She said: The thought of these spiders makes me feel queasy. I dont think the council is doing enough to inform local residents of what is going on.We are having to be very vigilante with looking out for them. The council should share information with us. Locals are understandably very concerned.But not all residents The Sun spoke to were concerned.One mum-of-three dismissed fears as a storm in a tea cup."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000441218215.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"princess eugenie wedding day comment","story":"As the ceremony started, long sections of the roadside security barriers in the shadow of Windsor Castle remained devoid of royal fans.In May, they were in danger of bursting as more than , wellwishers packed the streets for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.For that heady occasion, homes and shops were festooned with bunting and TV trucks jammed the streets.Yesterday, street vendor Jamie How, , said: “It’s like the moon — no atmosphere.“There are more police here than people and you can practically see the tumbleweed blowing down the street.”Jamie was trying to flog commemorative woolly scarves but admitted: “It’s been shocking. I have barely sold any.”Flag seller Ellie-Marie Rogers, , halved her prices from £ to £. She said: “It cost me £ to get here today, but I have barely made £. There just isn’t much interest.”I was handed a flag by one of the many council volunteers, who whispered to me: “It will help make the crowds look bigger.”Many of those who did turn up did not know a great deal about Princess Eugenie.Sitting in a coffee shop opposite the castle Alan Gregory, , who came from Ashford, Surrey, with we Jenny, , said: “I know she is ninth in line to the throne because I looked it up last night.“I struggle to pronounce her name, though.“We came for Meghan and Harry’s and that was totally dferent. You couldn’t get near the high street. It was ten deep.“We stayed in the park down by the riverside and there were big screens, Chris Evans DJ-ing and a great atmosphere.“Today we mainly came for the coffee at this cafe, which is excellent — though it is nice to be in Windsor for the occasion.”Louise Radford, , from nearby Datchet, was hoping to spot Harry, Meghan or Kate and her children. She said: “I love the royals. I don’t know that much about Eugenie but I wish her well, though.”Ex-pat Kathy Martin, , came from Spain to camp outside the weddings of both Prince William and Harry, plus the Queen’s th birthday and the births of all Kate Middleton’s children.She said: “I know Eugenie is further down the pecking order but I still would have felt bad to miss it.”One American who was in Windsor by chance on a business trip, said she was aware of Eugenie. “Sure, she is the one with the wacky hats, right ” she ventured.Others confessed to knowing even less about groom Jack Brooksbank, a former barman who now prefers to be known as European brand ambassador for tequila company Casamigos.Windsor resident Mila Bannerman, , said: “I don’t really know who he is. Is he something to do with gin ”The landlord of a pub along the procession route said: “It’s a weird atmosphere today.“The wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie in  was one of my best days ever.“But that was a sunny Saturday in June, not a windy Friday in October. Elton John’s wedding was busier than this.“Who is going to turn out for a Princess who parents are a bit of a joke anyway ”The crowds began to fill out a little as the carriage procession neared, with workers popping out of their offices to take a peek.But when the royal pair finally did zip past, beaming and waving from their covered coach, cheers that greeted them were more of a ripple than a roar. Think raffle winners at the village fete.After they passed, those who had turned up quickly melted away and within  minutes it was business as usual in Windsor.Nursery nurse Helen Catlin, , took the day off to drive to Windsor from Milton Keynes.She said: “There wasn’t much cheering or atmosphere but I am still pleased I came.“I got here early at am thinking I would need to bag a spot but it was empty. I had planned to do park-and-ride but it was deserted so I just drove straight into town and parked here. At least you could get a good view.”Mum Laura King watched the procession with her three-year-old daughter, Autumn. She said: “We were in town shopping anyway.“Autumn wanted to stay in the toy shop but she liked seeing the horses. We were here for Harry and Meghan’s and that was a totally dferent vibe — there was a real buzz around town for two weeks before.“In light of that I am not sure why Eugenie went for such a similar wedding so soon after. I hope she isn’t too disappointed.”The Duchess of Cornwall’s arrival at Crathie Primary, which has just nine pupils, was delayed by a tree on the road.And after being greeted by a stuffed deer in a classroom, she told the children of her love of the “wonderful” local wildle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Direct threats on Twitter, and blackmail attempts.“They said they would publish information about my parents. They said they had that information. I challenged them openly to do it, and then they disappeared.“It came from an address registered to the Russian embassy in Bulgaria.They tried to hack into my computer many times.”Mr Grozev added: The last time I was in Russia to teach media courses in , through out the four days I was there I was followed.On the way out, I was stopped at the border and told I could never come back to Russia, and they put a black stamp in my passport – which I now carry with me with pride.Bulgarian-born Mr Grozev is a successful businessman who specialises in the media, and a cyber sleuth in his spare time as a self-confessed computer geek and coder.He now lives in Austria, and works under his real name despite the risk to his own safety.Mr Grozev said: “I’ve decided it’s probably safer for me to use my real name because being in the open is probably a bit of protection.“I am conscious I am putting my family at some risk. Fortunately they understand that what I am doing is probably a bit more important than the risk.On Bellingcat’s mission, he added: “We’re doing this because we want to bring the truth to the people as fast as possible, and we want to prevent governments manipulating knowledge.“In three or four years time, the charges might be judicially proven but by that time the average European would have completely forgotten about the topic.And they would have consumed Russian propaganda that gives a relatively consistent and easy to digest version of the narrative.Russia’s ambassador to London yesterday accused Bellingcat of being a tool of the “deep establishment”.During a bad tempered press conference, Alexander Yakovenko insisted its staff have links with the intelligence services.But when asked for his proof for the allegation, the ambassador replied: “I can’t give the evidence”.Bellingcat has repeatedly denied receiving any help from any of the Western spy agencies in their exposé of Mishkin and Chepinga.Tory MP and former Army intelligence officer Bob Seely, who hosted the investigators’ press conference this week in the House of Commons, told the programme: “The work Bellingcat are doing is remarkable, and I think they are a force for good.“They are modern day Sherlock Holmes’s, and their digital detective work is extraordinary.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Clutching a posy and dressed in bridesmaid’s finery, Lotte was loving it.She waved to crowds from the steps of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, as her cousin Princess Eugenie wed sweetheart Jack Brooksbank. AS I stood with the assembled Press pack yesterday, beaming Eugenie turned to face me and waved in my direction.I’ve photographed her since the day she was born, when her mother carried her out of The Portland Hospital  years ago. It’s been a privilege to watch her flourish from a happy-go-lucky child into a warm and compassionate woman.So when I caught her eye yesterday, as I stood at Windsor Castle’s Cambridge Gate, I was hit with a wave of emotion.I was there when she was christened at Sandringham church. I watched her cry with frustration when she first learnt how to ride a horse. I still remember watching her putting on skis for the first time – a tiny tot slipping around in the snow.She showed her mettle when, aged , she had to undergo a serious operation for her scoliosis.On the following year’s ski trip she could only stand and watch as her parents and sister Beatrice went off skiing, and my heart broke for her.But Eugenie was brave and stoic – and she is still that way today.She chose a wedding dress with a plunging back to show off her operation scars, because projecting a positive image about her condition is so important to her.When my granddaughter Katie had to have the same surgery in , I asked Eugenieshe would meet her to offer some advice and support. The Princess didn’t hesitate and arranged to see her before the op.Her encouragement and advice helped in a huge way. The first thing Eugenie did was to show Katie her scar. She told her: “Be proud of this.”Ask anyone who works for Eugenie and they will tell you that she’s a truly smashing girl.After her parents orced when she was six, I asked her mother SarahI could take a photo of the three girls.Sarah said she needed to discuss it with her daughters, and Eugenie’s little voice piped up: “Oh yes Mummy, we’ll do it with Arthur.”Throughout everything she’s never stopped smiling – and I truly hope that’s the way it will stay now she’s married Jack Brooksbank.I’m told he’s a fantastic man. You could tell just by looking at them that they are deeply in love.And what a great day for them yesterday – they were given the full royal works.I wish them all the happiness in the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The “backstop” would see Britain mirror EU rules indefinitelyno new trade deal is in place to keep the Northern Irish border open.The EU now suggests a longer post-Brexit transition until December , citing lack of progress. It would see us paying Brussels billions extra.But Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab insisted that it must be “time-limited” and cannot leave Britain “in definite limbo”.However he stopped short of demanding a named date as Brussels has rejected this and Downing Street said his stance was consistent with the PM.No said the PM would never agree to a deal which would trap the UK in a backstop permanently.” But Ireland said having an open ended backstop was “a deal-breaker” for them.Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said: “The backstop needs to be there unless and until something better comes along. Nobody wants to use the backstop - this is like taking out fire insurance on your house.”But yesterday Philip Hammond explicitly stated the temporary period would be needed to be invoked.Mrs May has always insisted the backstop is unlikely to ever be needed, yet Mr Hammond said: “It is true that there needs to be a period - probably following the transition period that weve negotiated and before we enter into our long-term partnership.Mrs May now heads to Brussels on Wednesday to meet fellow EU leaders for a crunch summit that faces deadlock.Meanwhile open civil war broke out between Tory MPs and their crucial DUP allies over the issue, after the Northern Irish threatened to dethrone the PM.And as Sun columnist James Forsyth reveals today, some senior figures in the DUP want the PM to be ousted within weeks.Tory MP Nick Boles hit out: “Conservative leaders are chosen by Conservative MPs and Conservative Party members. Not by MPs of any other party. And we respond no better to threats than proud Ulster men or women do.And it emerged Eurocrats are mulling plans to prolong the transition period in a bid to stop the DUP torpedoing a Brexit deal.Sources said the withdrawal pact could be changed so the  month window can be extended to reassure Unionists the backstop will never be needed.The EU is making a demand of Theresa May she cannot fulfil without national humiliation, mass Cabinet resignations and near-certain Commons defeat.Brussels must know it is utterly unreasonable to demand we stay locked in their customs union indefinitely. Or that they should dictate when we can finally leave. Which they never would.A .million majority voted to leave. MPs voted that meant leaving the customs union. Our democracy, sovereignty and trading future are all at stake. Mrs May must defend all three. God knows what happens next weekshe doesn’t.The Remain ultras should be loving this chaos. Except they have suffered their own disaster. The EU sayswe held a second referendum and voted Remain, they’d strip us of our historic rebate on payments to Brussels.So along with violent unrest, a ­collapse of trust in democracy and a huge surge in extremism, Remaining would come with a whole new price tag on top of EU membership fees: Four thousand million quid a year.Good luck selling that.But the plot will enrage Brexiteers, who fear efforts to trap Britain permanently in the Single Market and Customs Union as a vassal state.During a transition the UK will be banned from striking trade deals and will have to keep making budget payments, while following EU rules without any say.Sources said Michel Barnier is considering a new plan that would see the transition stay in place until the end of  - meaning a two year, nine month phase.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And a potentially “invisible” one at that.It has a “man-optional” combat mode and potentially allows the military to take humans out of the battle physically by operating the vehicle remotely.The tank features advanced Active Protection System and crew protection from heavy weaponry including IEDs, antitank mines and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclearattacks.BAE’s ADAPTIV program provides camouflage that renders the vehicle essentially “invisible” to enemy forces using “active multi-spectral cloaking”.The cloaking can make the vehicle blend into the background so it seems to vanish. It can even mimic other objects making the tank look like rocks or a car in the eyes of the enemyneed be.The Defensive Aid Suite enables the armoured vehicle to classy targets, give warnings about threats and best manoeuvre guidance to others in the battle space. To prevent the vehicle from getting hit, it can also deploy countermeasures by itself.Human crews can operate from inside the vehicle, but it can also be controlled remotely — from anywhere in the world.The CV tends to involve a two-man turret armed with Bushmaster cannons. This remote-controlled solution allows powerful weapons to be unleashed on the battlefield but reduces the risk to soldiers by taking them out of the turret.The vehicle’s weaponry can be tailored to requirements and there’s quite a range of options — including weapons that can hit enemy aircraft and tanks.Its Fire Control System can already autonomously set the type of ammunition most suitable to defeat these threats, as well as automatically calculating the angles for maximum accuracy. By itself, the vehicle can also choose whether the best approach will be airburst, impact or delayed detonation.In the long term, combat vehicles may conduct missions entirely on their own however it is more likely there will always be humans in the loop.Soldiers could, for example, operate the unmanned CV MkIV combat vehicle while on-board another vehicle to amply the force.Or dismounted soldiers could control the unmanned vehicles, using them to perform reconnaissance in advance of troops.Patrols, whether dismounted or in vehicles, could pilot the smart combat vehicles to travel in front of them so that in the event of an IED the unmanned vehicle would be hit instead of soldiers.From inside a base, soldiers could also send the vehicles out on patrols.And of course, battalions of robotic combat vehicles could eventually be deployed in battles.A version of this story appeared on news.au"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000441416675.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the everest revellers most raucous race royal randwick","story":"The sozzled revellers left little to the imagination in tiny, plunging dresses despite rain lashing the event in Sydney.And some men appeared worse for wear as they celebrated by hoisting chairs in the air and jumping on each others shoulders.Others quaffed champagne as they watched Liam Payne perform in front of a cheering crowd at the Royal Randwick Racecourse.Everest is Australias richest race day with the winner taking home  million.Redzel romped to victory lading his owners another huge payday ahead of Trapeze Artist, with Osborne Bulls coming home third.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Critics complain UC, merging six benefits into a single structure, is harsher on people both in and out of work and is effectively a near poundbillion welfare cut. Campaigners have said some families could end up pound a month worse off. In its place we want a modern welfare state, helping instead of hurting children .  It comes after former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has described it as a “cruel and shyvindictive” system, warning it will plunge a record five million children below the breadline. Writing in the Mirror Mr Brown said that after  years in politics, he never expected to see poverty and hardship ing on such a terrible scale. His is the most prominent voice to join calls for the system to be scrapped. The Mirror revealed two weeks ago Labour was considering axing the benefit reforms.  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said on Sunday: “I think we are moving to a position now where it is just not sustainable. It will have to go.” Universal Credit introduced one system to replace six benefits: Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit, Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support, Employment Support Allowance and Housing Benefit. When former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith launched it in  he said that it would make work pay.  But the major problem was that it coincided with billions in Tory benefit cuts making it less generous than its design. Three quarters of claimants struggle with bills - according to the DWPs own figures.  Rent arrears soared pound a head in two trial zones, while food bank use in another area, Hastings, rose %. There have also been concerns raised by charities that paying the money to the head of the household fans the flames of domestic abuse.  While just last week the Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey is said to have admitted privately that millions of families will lose pound a month. In June the National Audit Office warned there is no evidence UC is making work pay and it may never be value for money.  Last year , people failed to get their first payment within a six-week limit. Ministers unveiled pound.bn of improvements in November , cutting the six-week wait to five, but critics say it was not enough. While even Mr Duncan Smith called for another poundbillion to be pumped in. After eight delays UC will only finish its rollout in March .

Tory MP Heidi Allen said signicant numbers of colleagues on my side of the House are saying this isnt right and are coming together to say the Chancellor needs to look at this again. The MP, a member of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, said the number of fellow Tories with concerns was approaching  now. The architect of the new system, former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, said an additional pound billion must be pumped into UC to make it operate as planned.Pressure mounts on Theresa May to scrap Universal Credit that will leave .million worse off Ms Allen told BBC Radio s Today: The two worst affected groups, and those that we should target financially, are single-parent families and second earners in families with children. To fix both of those would cost around pound billion. I would argue that one of the ways of funding that - we have managed migration planned for next year, when we move all claimants across from the old benefits system, and the Government has put about pound billion aside to protect those that would lose as a consequence of that. Sowe boost the system before we get there, we can essentially save some of that pound billion later down the line. On Thursday, Ms McVey declined to confirm or deny reports she had told Cabinet colleagues that some claimants would lose out to the tune of pound a month. But challenged over a think-tank estimate that three million people will be about pound, a year worse-off due to the move to UC, Ms McVey told the BBC: I have said we made tough decisions and some people will be worse off. Prime Minister Theresa May told the Commons on Wednesday that none of the two million-plus claimants due to be transferred onto UC in a managed migration starting next July would see reductions in payments, thanks to the pound billion transition protection fund. Mr Hammond will deliver his Budget on October  and Labour is seeking to capitalise on Tory unease by leading a debate on UC on Wednesday. The Chancellor is already under pressure to find funding for the promised cash boost to the NHS, with speculation that he could target pension tax relief - which he described as eye-wateringly expensive in The Times. South Cambridgeshire MP Ms Allen said the relief benefits those most able to save, so I would support it and also suggested that pausing the increase in the income tax personal allowance could also be a source of funds. A more politically-sensitive plan could be breaking the pensions triple lock, which guarantees increases of at least .% a year. I still wish we had the political nerve to look at the triple lock, that costs around pound billion a year,she said, but pension increases had outsripped both inflation and wage growth.

She hopes this will help the youngsters remember her when she is not around any more. Kaylea complained of stomach pains for years - but says doctors told her it was nothing to worry about.In January , she was diagnosed with stage  bowel cancer which had spread to her liver, the Liverpool Echo reported.At the time, her two children were just three and nine months old.  The mum underwent sessions of chemotherapy every fortnight for three months in hope of reducing the tumours - but this was unsuccessful. After having an operation to remove part of her bowel and half of her liver, the teaching assistant thought she had beaten the cancer and was getting stronger each day. Her sister, Sinead Callacher said: At the time, Kaylea’s two beautul babies, Kian and Aoe were just three years old and nine months old. This news, as you can imagine, was very hard to digest. However, Kaylea being the strongest person I know, put up a fight for her family. However, Kaylea started experiencing pain and sickness earlier this month and was admitted to Merseysides Aintree Hospital again on Tuesday. Doctors carried out scans on Wednesday, which revealed that the cancer has ed and is now terminal.  Sinead added: Bringing her scan forward, we heard the news we hoped we would never hear. Kaylea’s cancer is back and this time has spread all over her liver, meaning another operation is out of the question. [We are] now being told there is nothing they can do and she may not make it to see Christmas. Doctors have predicted that Kaylea does not have long left to live, and have advised her to celebrate Christmas next month, which she is hoping to do with her family in a cottage. Kaylea, who is engaged to her partner of  years, Mark McCole, has also announced her final wish is to marry him before she dies. Kaylea thought this wasnt going to be possible, but she has today been announced as the winner of the Liverpool Echos Win a Wedding competition.

Upon hearing she was the winner of the wedding worth pound,, Kaylea said: We met in the Yates bar in Bootle when we were just , and I just cant explain what this means to us. We have wanted to marry for so long and then we had kids, and then this news. Its amazing - it means the world to us both. The doctors told me to do what I wanted to do, and I will now be able to do both - spend Christmas with my family and marry Mark. The particularly touching reason Kaylea wanted to get married before she passed away, however, was so that she would have the same surname as her children.  She explained: One of the big things is I want my children to have the same surname as me. I want them to realise I was part of their le, even when Im not around anymore. Although there is no cure for the cancer, Kayleas family have launched a fundraising page in an attempt to raise pound, for treatment. Sinead, , set up the page and claims without it my sister might not make it until Christmas. She added: The specialists have gave us one chance but its not through the NHS and its pound, per round. We cant give up on my sister, please I need all your help. The drug, from America, is called Avastin and is used alongside chemotherapy in an attempt to prevent existing tumors growing further.  While the treatment will not cure Kaylea, Sinead hopes it will extend her le by a few more months to give her time with her children. The page was launched just yesterday, and already more than pound, has been raised. Kaylea said: Just do everything you want to do - le is too short.

In May, she had worn a wedding gown by the same designer as she married Harry in a spectacular service at the th Century chapel. Today, the scene was set once more for a showstopping wedding. But this time, it was the turn of the Queens granddaughter and drinks executive Jack Brooksbank to take centre stage in the church. However, the couples ceremony was noticeably more muted than Harry and Meghans - as Zara pointed out to the Duke of Sussex.

The brides arrival was heralded by trumpeters lined out at the back of chapel - which startled some members of the young bridal party. Prince George was spotted putting his hands over his ears. The mischievous five-year-old had royal fans in stitches as he giggled hysterically and picked his nose at points throughout the day.  Chosen as a page boy by Eugenie and Jack, he was seen laughing with his seven-year-old cousin Savannah Phillips as they stood in the chapel. Dressed in a smart little suit, he appeared greatly amused as little Savannah tipped her head back and pretended to play a trumpet. He was also seen craning his neck to take in his surroundings, apparently curious to be at the second royal wedding of the year at the chapel. His younger sister, Princess Charlotte, was a bridesmaid - as was Mia Tindall, the daughter of Zara and her rugby player husband Mike. George and Charlotte have a lot of wedding experience, having already been page boy and bridesmaid for at least three other couples.

The Queens granddaughter made her entrance at the churchs West Steps in a  Rolls Royce Phantom VI belonging to her grandmother. Jack was waiting at the altar, alongside his best man and brother, Tom. He uttered Oh, my heart when he saw his bride, before adding Oh break my heart.

Doctors say the two-month-old boy suffers near-continuous seizures and should be allowed to die. They say he has a very severe brain abnormality, is in a poor condition, and should get palliative care only. Ms Justice Russell analysed the dispute at a public hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London on Friday. She is expected to announce her decision in the near future. The little boy is being treated at a hospital in the north of England but the judge says journalists must not reveal his identity or name the NHS trust with responsibility for his care. Specialists say the boy, who weighs . kilograms - about seven-and-a-half pounds - suffers near-continuous seizures which are resistant to treatment.  One doctor told Ms Justice Russell that the little boy has a low level of awareness but can feel pain and has been seen to grimace. Specialists said the burdens of treatment outweigh the benefits. But the woman said her son has responded to her and his father. When you call him by his name he looks at you, she said. When you bend down and do nose-to-nose he likes it... and he has a little smile which he gives you.

But then on October , Harrys cousin, Princess Eugenie got married to her long-term love Jack Brooksbank and our excitement reignited. As expected the day was a lavish affair, with tiaras, designer gowns, decadent flower arrangements and a whole host of famous faces - everyone from Cara Delevingne to Robbie Williams was in attendance.It would be fair to say we were keeping an eagle-eye on everything that was going on throughout the ceremony, and at one pint we couldnt help but notice something a little odd.  With over  guests invited to the wedding, it was said the couple would have to add extra seats to the venue to fit everyone in. So with lots of chairs to fill, why on earth would the couple leave one of the best seats in the church empty This was the question on our lips when we realised that a front row seat beside the senior members of the royal family was noticeably not filled on the day.But it turns out there was a very good reason for this - and its all to do with the Queen.  The reason the seat would have been empty is so Eugenie could keep her grandmother happy.Traditionally the Queen and the rest of the royals sit in the right hand choir pews at St Georges Chapel , closest to the altar, as was previously seen in May.And royal protocol dictates that no one is allowed to sit in front of the Queen and obstruct her view.

But drizzle might have been better to illustrate many people’s feelings about us being fleeced of upwards of poundmillion for the “big day”. Not to mention Windsor’s homeless being encouraged to move on by the local council to “protect” them from all the camera crews and shyday-trippers. Predictions that Britain is on the verge of becoming a republic are, of course, wide of the mark. But even the most die-hard royalist must blush at the cost and pantomime of Eugenie, little more than a frivolous clinger-on, marrying her tequila salesman. I’ve genuinely no wish to rain on the big day of two posh, privileged no-marks but sometimes needs must.  What we witnessed in Windsor was a jet set princess and her hubby, Jack Bottlebank, demonstrating why someinsist the monarchy is an outdated, expensive irrelevancy in modern Britain. This was like a feature- version of Rip- Off Britain with a congregation of  – many of whom looked asthey barely knew the bride and groom – dominated by those who’d go to the opening of an envelope for a moment in the paparazzi spotlight.Gawpers and grovellers allowed to be unpaid TV extras in the grounds of Windsor Castle might have a legal claim to the pound. an hour legal minimum wage when it was apparent the passing toffs didn’t give a vol-au-vent for them. I’ve witnessed more enthusiastic gatherings in village fetes. But the British public cannot be fooled.  Crowds less than one deep in areas and a general sense of disinterest from locals was the most eloquent public raspberry to proceedings. Cops drafted in to manage security among the expected masses simply twiddled thumbs and blew cobwebs from the barriers.But there was at least comedy. It was impossible to keep a straight face at the royalRuritania when TV presenter Richard Bacon admitted he mainly knew Eugenie “through ious social events” and his neighbours in LA own the art gallery she “worked” for. Quite.And there was Eamonn Holmes asserting the spectacle was good for a post-Brexit UK PLC with “all the Rolls-Royces” ferrying the most privileged guests up to the doors, conveniently overlooking the fact the firm’s owned by BMW of Germany – who are warning us quitting Europe will be disastrous for motor manufacturing.  Hangers-on represented by entitled Eugenie, a person performing zero public duties and an insignicant ninth in line to the gilded sinecure, will ultimately prove the monarchy’s undoing. Every other family in the land funding their own weddings reinforces why the fshyreeloaders are on borrowed time. Eugenie’s daddy “Air Miles” Andy and mummy Fergie, shystrangers to paying their own way in le, picking up the tab would be fine. But when a storm’s brewing over Universal Credit cuts for millions of struggling families, how absurd to lavish cash on a society bash for never-weres and never-will-bes. Austerity for the many, not the royal two, screams loudly of how much we are definitely not all in this together. The much-broken hereditary chain tricking Mr and Mrs into thinking a handout is theirs by right is a rusting link to centuries of rule by tyrants. In a modern democracy, royals are as useful as square wheels on a bike. Eugenie’s Meghan Markle mini-me act with that carriage vanity ride illustrates a disconnect in the bankrolled bubble from the harsh realities for those of us required to feather-bed the apex of an unearned hierarchy.

Well send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here.  The poisonous role of the royals is to legitimise unearned wealth and power, protecting the privileges of elites. Sibling rivalry has seen Eugenie and big sis Beatrice battle it out for the annual title of holidaymaker of the year for the past decade. Eugenie lost out, just, until now. Who could argue the public cash squandered today couldn’t have been better spent on nurses, teachers, social workers, cops, firefighters or any public servant you are to name  The wastefulness threatens to unleash the worst turbulence for this gilded establishment since the uproar over poundmillion to renovate Buckingham Palace for the Queen and her closest relatives. Eugenie’s auntie Camilla cannily arranged to be at a school harvest festival in Scotland to miss the Windsor show. But pity the poor needy old lady who answered a knock on the door to find a beaming pupil dropping off a horsey member of the country set rather than a jar of jam. Inviting more guests than Harry and Meghan was a grand statement from the otherwise shyirrelevant. We can laugh, mock and try to ignore the self-importance of the me-me-mes until the bills come in. The monarchy relies on mystique, a superiority fallacy. Today the bride looked beautul and her swooning husband dutully nervous. Let’s wish them that happy and long le together. And also thank the married couple for confirming the royal family is essentially parasitical, feeding on the gullibility of decent people. Because those decent people resent being taken for granted.

Predicted to cause flight cancellations, train delays and standstill traffic, a business group has claimed the bad weather could cost the economy as much as pound million.Met Office meteorologist Matthew Box said: On Saturday there will be rain pushing into South West Wales, parts of Ireland, England and Scotland.For Saturday, the Met Office has issued an amber rain warning for South Wales and very strong winds on Saturday. There is a risk of floods and risk to travel so I advise everyone keep updated with local weather reports, he continued. Areas such as South West Wales, Cornwall and Devon will see very strong gusts on Saturday morning. Winds will reach up to mph. Conditions are expected to improve by Sunday with dry sunny spells during the day but possible showers in the north later on.  Today hundreds of homes have been left without power, falling trees and high seas are causing major disruption with weather warnings expected to remain in place until Saturday evening. Roads across Devon have been blocked by debris and standing water as flights and trains cancelled in the face of winds at more than mph and up to a weeks rain falling in a few hours. All CrossCountry trains are stopped in and out of Devon - not passing beyond Exeter or Plymouth so they do not cross the Dawlish sea wall. Falling trees caused delays for passengers in Plymouth and Cornwall this morning. Flybe cancelled all flights in and out of Exeter until this afternoon when the weather was expected to improve.  Tim Jones, chairman of the South West Business Council, said: With an extreme weather event like this, we reckon that the impact on business to be around pound million in terms of access to work and fracturing the supply chain which relies so heavily on just-in-time deliveries. The greatest rupturing is still on our road network, the fragility of having just one single artery, the M, into the region is exposed when we have bad weather. Mr Jones said that air travel has remained the most resilient in the face of bad weather but the resilience of the railway remains a priority for economic leaders. He said: This re-emphasises the impact of the vulnerable Dawlish sea wall and other flood prone areas, like Cowley Bridge. Today: It is expected to be a wet day across Scotland, Northern Ireland and western parts of England and Wales. Central and eastern England will be mostly dry and rather warm with sunny spells and iable amounts of cloud cover. There will be a near gale force southerly wind for England and Wales. Tonight: It will be wet across Northern Ireland and Scotland with rain that could be heavy. Across Wales and western England there will be light rain though this will ease through the night. A dry start for central and eastern England though rain will move in during the early hours that could be heavy. Sunday and Monday: Tomorrow will be wet and cloudy for northern and eastern parts with rain that could be heavy at times. A chance of sunny spells in the west. Mostly dry with patchy cloud and sunny spells for many on Monday. There is a chance of a few light showers across Scotland throughout, getting heavier later.

Flavourings in e-cigarettes harm the lungs by triggering inflammation, scientists have warned. The battery-powered devices are promoted as a tool to help smokers quit the habit. But even short term use causes as much or more damage as the real thing, said the Greek team. In experiments on mice they found the additives, including flavourings, caused lung inflammation similar or worse than that seen in traditional cigarette use.  Corresponding author Dr Constaninos Glynos said: The observed detrimental effects in the lung upon e-cigarette vapour exposure in animal models highlight the need for further investigation of safety and toxicity of these rapidly expanding devices worldwide. They simulate smoking a traditional cigarette by dispensing a vapour derived from liquid chemicals in a refillable cartridge that typically contain propylene glycol, nicotine and often flavourings. Propylene glycol - a colourless and odourless additive - is found in numerous processed food and beverages. It is also used as a solvent in a number pharmaceuticals.  The findings, published in the American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular, show e-cigs and refills are not well regulated - and their long-term effects on health are unknown. So the researchers compared several groups of mice that received whole-body exposure to ying chemical combinations four times each day, with every session separated by -minute smoke-free intervals.  Dr Glynos said: Electronic cigarettes are advertised as a less harmful nicotine delivery system or as a new smoking cessation tool. Our findings suggest that exposure to e-cig vapour can trigger inflammatory responses and adversely affect respiratory system mechanics. In many cases, the added flavor in e-cigs exacerbated the detrimental effects of e-cig vapour. One group received cigarette smoke and three others e-cig vapours containing either propylene glycol, both this and nicotine or these two ingredient and a tobacco flavouring. A fth batch just got normal, healthy air and acted as a control. Some animals in each party underwent the regime for three daysand others four weeks . There was an increase in markers of inflammation, mucus production and altered lungin all three e-cig groups - after only three days. But those getting propylene glycol alone showed fewer negative effects with long-term exposure. Dr Glynos, of the University of Athens, said this suggests the additive elicits only a temporary irritation that eventually subsides with continued use. In addition, two inflammation-producing proteins became elevated in the flavouring group.  This means some of the many flavouring components on the market may not be safe for even short-term use, said Dr Glynos. The condition of the e-cig groups alarmed the researchers. The level of oxidative stress - damage at a cellular level - in those exposed to flavourings was equal to or higher than that of the cigarette group. However, respiratory mechanics were adversely affected only in mice exposed to cigarette smoke - and not to e-cig vapour after prolonged treatment. Dr Glynos added: We conclude that both e-cig vaping and conventional cigarette smoking negatively impact lung biology. His findings follow a British study earlier this year that also suggested vaping is more harmful than previously thought. It found some of the effects are similar to those seen in smokers and people with chronic lung disease - boosting the production of inflammatory chemicals in the body. The University of Birmingham scientists extracted cells from lung samples provided by healthy non-smokers and exposed them to e-cig fluid, condensed vapour or nothing for  hours. Exposure to the vapour increased cell death and the production of inflammatory chemicals. And the ability of cells to engulf bacteria was signicantly impaired in those exposed to vapour. Public Health England says e-cigs are  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes. And they suggest smokers should consider switching to vaping in a bid to help them quit. But critics warn vaping may cause lung disease, keep people hooked on nicotine, or act as route in to smoking for kids. Some .million Brits smoke and .million use e-cigs, Office for National Statistics figures show.

A woman named Chachi Chatters is responsible for the story, which has captured the hearts of thousands of social media users and even spawned a Twitter moment. Chachi began recounting the story on October , when she informed her followers that seven or eight years ago, her best friends daughter was graduating from Yale University so she decided to take her out for dinner to celebrate. But when she got to New Haven, she discovered the young girl and her friends already had plans to go to a concert - and theyd bought her a ticket. She admits she was reluctant to go with them at first. I tried to weasel my way out. Im too old. I dont want to have a cardiac arrest halfway through. I will drag you all down with me. However she eventually ended up attending the show.  Needless to say, I had the time of my le. We sang along to the most memorable songs. Its always amazing when you know the lyrics better than the young ones, she recalls. After the concert she drove the girls back to their dorms. By this time she claims it was about am and she was absolutely starving, so she decided to drop into a nearby pizzeria.I went to a pizza place outside New Haven. For some reason, it was bustling. There was a huge group of people and everyone seemed to know everyone. There were no tables. I decided to just head to one of the barstools.I placed my order. Someone came and sat next to me.  I looked at her. I looked at her again. I looked at her for a minute before I remembered I wasnt breathing.And she had a good reason to be shocked, because the person sat beside her was none other than the superstar she had just seen perform - Dolly Parton.According to Chaci, the American country singer turned to her and asked: Lovebud, you ok  The woman admits she struggled to play it cool, but thankfully the appetisers soon arrived distracting them both.  Chachi had ordered a plate of garlic knots - which she says attracted Dollys attention. She asked meshe could have one from my plate. She offered me a slice of her stromboli. I respectfully declined it had ham. Does that mean I dont get to ask for another one of your garlic knots  A polite conversation ensued. Im pretending to be all cool. Inside, Im purring like a happy cat. The waiter comes over and whispered, your tables ready maam. I was ready to say goodbye and eat my pizza and be happy for the rest of my le.  But instead, she turned to me and asked meId like to join her. Chachi jokes that she almost did a royal curtsy right there and then, but somehow she managed to maintain her composure and accepted the invitation. She claims they that during the evening they talked about growing up, kids, health issues, husbands, politics, weather, pedicures and sampled each others pizza. Chachi adds: In the end, we paid our own bills and were going to go our separate ways. She asked someone in her entourage for a pen.

Jamal Khashoggi, who went missing after entering the Saudi Arabia consulate in the Turkish capital of Istanbul last week, was wearing the watch in the crucial moments before his disappearance, pro-government newspaper Sabah reported. The paper on Saturday cited “reliable sources in a special intelligence department” and claimed the Washington Post journalist had turned on the recording feature before entering the embassy. “The moments when Khashoggi was interrogated, tortured and murdered were recorded in the Apple Watchs memory,” the paper said, adding that the watch was in sync with his iPhone, which he had left with his girlfriend. It follows two senior Turkish officials telling Reuters the -year-old reporter had been wearing a black Apple Watch before entering the embassy and that it was connected to a mobile phone he had left behind.  The Turkish paper claims Saudi officials realised Khashoggi was wearing the watch only after he was killed, and that they used his fingerprint to unlock it. They reportedly managed to delete some files, but not all of them. The reports, however, are at odds with an Apple representative confirming to CNN that the watch has no such fingerprint feature to unlock it. Turkey has accused Saudi Arabia of being responsible for the abduction and murder of Khashoggi, a fierce critic of regime in Riyad. Saudi Arabia vehemently denies the allegations, claiming Khashoggi left the embassy prior to disappearing on October .  The news comes as UN chief Antonio Guterres demanded the truth over the journalists disappearance, saying he feared such disappearances would otherwise become a new normal. Guterres told the BBC at the International Monetary Fund meeting in Bali: We need to have a strong request for the truth to be clear.  Saying there should be legislation in place guaranteeing accountability, he said: I must say I am feeling worried [at] this apparent new normal. Because this kind of incident is multiplying and its absolutely essential to make sure that the international community says clearly that this is not something that can happen.

fresh determination to highlight the dangers of racial and ethnic discrimination.Molly said: “Hearing survivors’ stories, as well as a rabbi who came to speak to us as well, really drove home how important it is that we challenge discrimination when we see it.”In the coming months, the pair hope to hold assemblies along with lessons for the younger pupils at the school about

similarities with things that happened in the s.”The visit left a lasting effect on the pair, with both hoping to take the message forward after they leave school.Paulina said: “It was a lot more

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked.

She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know.

It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"council-approves-building-of-57-affordable-homes","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has approved plans to build  affordable homes in Chirnside.Springfield Properties, which is based in Elgin, Moray, plans to build a new affordable housing estate behind Northfield terrace, with an access point on Main Street East End.The developers have also confirmed that the scheme will be taken over by a local affordable housing provider which will wholly own and operate the development.However, the proposals have been met with several objections from Chirnside residents, who raised concerns around road access, parking, housing density and the impact on local house prices.Mrs Margaret Thomson Malone, a neighbour of the proposed site, wrote: ldquoThere will be numerous traffic jams, there already are several times a day when two heavy lorries meet on a road packed with parked cars.ldquoWhere do you think all the people who would live in these houses are going to park when it snows or is covered in ice as it is every winter at some point ldquoSeveral people have now decided to sell their houses.

central belt and Strathclyde.And new electric trains with more seats are being introduced to lines around Falkirk, Dunblane, Alloa and Edinburgh.There will also be additional trains across the central

made on the Borders Railway since it opened in .The popularity of the -mile stretch of track is showing no signs of slowing down either with year on year increases.But there are regular complaints from passengers about standing-room only carriages for much of the journey.ScotRail announced last year that new Class  trains would be brought onto the Borders Railway - allowing for additional carriages to be added.Although not included in this weeks announcement, a spokesman has confirmed the new engines are still earmarked for Tweedbank.And they believe the improved timetable for the rest of Scotland will have a positive impact for local commuters.A ScotRail Alliance spokesperson said: ldquoThe introduction of our new trains and the electrication of the central belt will allow us to make best use of our existing fleet and make positive timetable changes in the Borders.ldquoNext year, we will begin to redeploy our existing class  trains to Fe and the Borders.\"These trains will add more than , extra seats each day.ScotRails improved timetable will come into force on December .Managing director Alex Hynes made the announcement this week.He said: \"The improvements we are making to our timetable from December mean ScotRail has reached another milestone as we build the best railway Scotland has ever had.\"This is just the first phase of the work we are doing to deliver

team and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset caused by this issue it has been great to hear from so many of my constituents.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"trios head shave of the century","story":"Lewis

The Master Plan talks about , jobs being created.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

And in a strongly-worded article in the Belfast , Mrs Foster warned against the EUrsquos backstop proposal and also stressed that she would not accept any measure that resulted in extra checks for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Her party has threatened to cause a political crisis by voting down Philip Hammondrsquos BudgetMrs May gives way to Brussels and Mrs Foster said: ldquoThe DUPrsquos actions this week are not as some have suggested about lsquoflexing musclersquo.ldquoThis is no game.ldquoAnyone engaging in this in a light-hearted way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we will make in the coming weeks.Downing Street insisted thatMrs May would never agree a Brexit deal with the EU which ldquotraps the UK permanently in a customs union.The pledge came amid continued speculation over possible ministerial resignationsthe Prime Minister gives too much ground ahead of the Brussels summit next week.Stewart Jackson, who was chief of staff to former Brexit secretary David Davis, said it was ldquoquite possible that another Cabinet minister could follow the example of his former boss and resign.Stewart Jackson, former Brexit minister David Davisrsquos special advisor said weekend resignations over Brexit were ldquoquite possible.ldquoPolitical resignations are part of the landscape#newsnight | #InsidethePapers| @BrexitStewart pic xQuAIsyxwmdash BBC NewsnightOctober , He told BBCrsquos Newsnight Brexit was a ldquofundamental, existential issue and ldquoon that basis maybe some people will obviously consider their position."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8018957.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"sky-sports-reporter-blasts-hoops-fans-accusing-her-of-gers-bias-and-reveals-what-side-she-really-backs","story":"Trolls accused Hayley McQueen of backing Rangers after a group of Hoops fans were unhappy with Skys Coverage of a recent match.Why you think Irsquom a Rangers fan, god knows, itrsquos obviously what you want to believe.

He was a fellow MP who had been angered, she suspected, by her declaring that the enemies of Scotland were not the English but ldquoScots traitors within the gate.Whatever the reason, the shadow behind her in the corridor, or sitting too close in the library, was at first creepy and soon became frightening. Late one evening, after being apprehended in the empty passageways of Westminster, she had to flee to the safety of the Speakerrsquos room. It was a harsh introduction to the intimidating culture she was now part of, and few people knew of it until Ewing published her autobiography, some  years later. Even then, she did not name her nemesis.Role models donrsquot come much more glamorous or impressive than Madame Ecosse. Todayrsquos political landscape stands as it does in large measure thanks to her determination and grit. She showed that there was no impediment to women occupying high office. Fty years on, there has been a quiet revolution in the political sphere ndash matching that in almost every other domain. When I began to compile Scotland: Her Story, an eye-witness account of history as experienced by women from the early middle ages to our own times, three of our political parties were led by women, one of whom was also First Minister. We were soon also to have another female Prime Minister at Westminster.Such a groundswell in womenrsquos status would have been unthinkable only a few years before. Yet by the time Nicola Sturgeon, Kezia Dugdale and Ruth Davidson were in situ, nobody, with the possible exception of the hoariest dinosaurs, blinked an eye.Itrsquos not only in politics that the atmosphere and opportunities have changed beyond recognition. I had just started primary school when Ewing rolled up at Westminster in a Hillman Imp and high heels so new they hurt.Since then, womenrsquos flourishing has been remarkable. Not so long ago, the world of literature was almost as closed a shop as a Masonic Lodge. The smattering of female novelists and poets who were published were often cold-shouldered and belittled ndash read Robin Jenkinsrsquos withering assessment, for instance, of Muriel Spark.Now, with writers of the profile of J K Rowling or Jackie Kay, Val McDermid or Ali Smith, they lead the charge, here and internationally. In business, the wintry sea of grey suits has been enriched by the presence of those such as Ann Gloag, Ann Budge and Michelle Mone.Turn on the radio and yoursquoll often find a female professor of astronomy explaining the universe ndash a broadcast that is as likely to be presented, edited, or produced by a woman as by a man. Meanwhile in sport, music, comedy, theatre, finance, the law, the church and universities, men are no longer the only ones at the controls. So far, the only Scot to have played in a world-cup winning football teamhas been a woman.Those  years of achievement, however, have been hard-won. They represent an egg-cup of sand on a beach stretching back to the start of time. At no point in those past millennia, however, have women been quiet or meek. It only looks that way because they have gone unnoticed. Thankfully a rare few made it into the earliest records which, eventhey were written by men, were obliged to recount some of their deeds. Thus you have the nuns at Coldingham Priory who preferred to slice off their own noses and upper lips than be raped by Vikings. Or you catch sight of ale-women, arguably the second oldest profession in the world, as the authorities tell them when they can sell their wares, and for how much, and the fines for breaking the rules.In the middle ages as now, there were two parallel worlds. The lives of queens and princesses, aristocrats and nuns were inconceivably dferent from those of ordinary people. Though Irsquod rather have lived in a hovel warmed by the fug of family and beasts than in a cavernous castle or convent, from some perspectives they had it far better: good food, warm clothes, sound houses, and medical attention when they were ill. But in other ways their lives were unenviable. Some of those who championed Robert the Bruce, for instance, were punished by being hung for years from cages on the town walls. Others, like the Maid of Norway, were sent overseas as diplomatic pawns, in her case sailing to Scotland at the age of seven, to take up her highly disputatious role as queen. She died en route.Down the centuries, no figure, male or female, stands out more vividly than Mary Queen of Scots. One of the reasons she has caught the popular imagination is that, during a highly eventful, tumultuous le, she left such a substantial and revealing store of letters. A charismatic figure, almost every move she made was recorded by those near her. Whether they loved or loathed her, they recognised they were in the presence of a remarkable inidual.Mary Stuartrsquos dramatic reign represented a high point for womenrsquos influence in the public domain. But with accusations of aiding and abetting murder and committing treason, leading to her eventual execution, it was also its nadir. What Mary experienced, though, as an educated and privileged royal, bears no resemblance to the way commoners lived. Her end might have been grisly, but it was no more so than that of countless others, who did not survive childbirth, or died of malnutrition or disease, or were too old to scrape a living, and ended their days as paupers. To catch a glimpse of these women, in the th century and earlier, is like crouching at a keyhole. They can be spied, but fleetingly, incompletely, with too much left to guesswork.One of the most regrettable chasms in the historical record is that except for occasional appearances in legal documents, the vast majority of women, for  years and more, passed unnoticed. Hidden, invisible, or unimportant, they were airbrushed out of existence. The same can be said of men from the lower classes, and children of all ranks.Thank goodness, then, for the Reformation, and the impulse it brought to introduce universal education. By the th century, women with the time and means were keeping journals, sending letters, and soon would be writing books and in some cases, such as the brilliant mathematician Mary Somerville, setting the intellectual world alight. At the same time, the sourcebooks of history ndash still kept strictly in menrsquos hands ndash grew more abundant, and as they become more expansive, so do women make more frequent appearances. From this point, more or less, Her Story finds its voice, as women begin to tell their own stories.What a wealth of information they offer about how we lived. Itrsquos like stepping into a novel by Mary Gaskell or Jane Austen, utterly captivating, but also true. In gathering the material for this book I have tried to capture the pivotal moments of history ndash witchhunts, the Restoration, Covenanters, Jacobites, the Clearances and the industrial revolution, suffragettes, the first and second world wars, the birth of the welfare state, and so on. Yet while these are the backbone of history, some of the most pungent stories come not from the front row of history, as with the widow who found the hacked and smouldering bodies of Red Coats outside her house at Culloden, but from seemingly incidental, mundane detail.A description of changing habits by compulsive diarist Elizabeth Mure in the s, for instance, shows the dficulty women had in meeting eligible men, most of whom seemed to prefer drinking and gambling with their friends to finding a we. When women ventured out to a public event, in hope of finding romance, they usually found the men dead drunk. ldquoIn this kind of intercourss [sic] there is little chance for forming attachments. The women see the men in the worst light, and what impression they make on the men is forgot by them in the morning. A century later, factory worker Ellen Johnstonrsquos overwrought memoir offers one of the earliest allusions to sexual abuse. In her case it was so dreadful she contemplated suicide.Also the victim of savage domestic abuse, but at the other end of the social spectrum, is the Countess of Strathmore, an heiress whose money-grabbing second husband was violently cruel. The result was a blow-by-blow account, at his command, of everything bad she had ever done. Consequently, we learn how th-century society ladies terminated unwanted pregnancies by their lovers: ldquoI prevailed upon him to bring me a quack medicine he had heard of for miscarriage it was of a copperas [coppery] substance, by the taste and look he gave it me very reluctantly, as he said he did not know but it might be poison however, I would have it.Fast forward down the years, though, and by  things there is young Ann Flynn, not long out of school and working in a Glasgow office: ldquoAnd I had there my first encounter with someone trying to play me up sexwise. My first encounter was with one of my nice bossrsquos friends. And I remember removing his hand from me and looking up at him and saying, lsquoDo you see these teeth rsquolsquoSee these teeth  If you so much as lay a finger on me I shall bite right through till the blood drips out of you.rsquo And the man drew back and looked at me with such surprise...From incidents like this, and far worse, the #MeToo movement has emerged. The need for taking such a stance, even in these supposedly enlightened times, tells its own story. Too many men still hold assumptions as old as the hills. In this respect, Ann Flynnrsquos story is only one of many in the book which are timeless, connecting the experiences of women from every era since records began, and melting the years between them.For most of the past, of course, womenrsquos domain has been primarily at home. For every we who sprang her husband from gaol in disguise, like the Jacobite Countess of Nithsdale, there were thousands who did nothing more thrilling than keep their families fed, clothed and reasonably clean. Some excelled at this. To read Victorian domestic goddess Margaret MacKirdy Blackrsquos guide on how to cook, run a house and do the laundry is to realise what hard and all-consuming labour it could be. An account of how a th-century farmerrsquos we spent her day, from dawn till after dark, is humbling. For those with servants to help ease the load, they brought their own problems. In the case of Jane Carlyle, we of the famous historian but more importantly one of the finest letter writers of her day, her housemaid was an alcoholic. This could make things fraught, especially since she was so fond of her.In another Victorian household, the cookrsquos temper was as hot as her curries. Sacked from one post by the novelist Janet Storey, Betty went to work for a friend of hers. It proved a short-lived reprieve. ldquoNot long after she had taken up her duties, Mr Sprot, hearing from his we that what she considered too large fires were being burnt in the kitchen, and that the cook paid no attention to her remonstrances, went downstairs one day to have a look himself. The fire was large, and he began to venture on some observations, when he was promptly accosted by Betty seizing in her hand a large kitchen towel and flapping it violently on the table, exclaiming in a furious tone, lsquoOot orsquo ma kitchen! Oot orsquo ma kitchen! Irsquoll hae nae spyinrsquo maisters here!rsquo while her attitude and manner were so menacing that the much-alarmed gentleman lost no time in retiring from the lower regions. Not surprisingly, Betty departed shortly thereafter.Itrsquos often said that history is written by the victors but it has also, until the last century, been exclusively written by men. In my book I have tried to redress some of that imbalance, to capture a fraction of a world we have lost, and fill some of historyrsquos gaps. Constitutional, political and religious affairs play their part, but the main focus is not on edicts or treaties, battles or wars, but on people. It is a snapshot of those girls, women, daughters, wives, aunts and grandmothers who underpinned everything that happened, yet who, until recent times, rarely made the headlines because their efforts were considered unimportant.In these pages, you watch how women married, gave birth and raised their families from the times of St Margaret to our own how they earned a living, tended the aged or felt about getting old themselves how they viewed their politicians and society, struggled to be educated, campaigned for their rights. To witness all this is to see the country not through the lens of official accounts, but in three dimensions. It adds a layer of depth and complexity, and gives a place to the everyday, which is not to say it was not extraordinary. From the medieval nursemaid who had a baby torn from her arms and murdered to the gunnerrsquos we in the Napoleonic wars who gave her husband wine to keep his spirits up during battle, from the Iolaire widow begging for support, to the adopted black baby girl who blossomed to become our Makar, the stories that have brought us to where we are today are a powerful and inspiring legacy. As they take us back, whether only a few decades, or several hundred years, this doesnrsquot feel like history. It feels like le.Scotland: Her Story by Rosemary Goring is published by Birlinn, priced pound"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Why pragmatism and patience have to be the order of the day for SNP","story":"Nicola Sturgeon wants to keep hope alive, but shersquos not going to call any referendum she canrsquot be sure of winning. Activists have to content themselves with the thin gruel of ldquoperseverance, pragmatism and patience. Her conference speech was almost Presbyterian in its downbeat realism: you can wave all the flags you want, but therersquos no short cut to independence.Most of her troops get this. The SNP MP Angus MacNeill used precisely the wrong historical analogy when he urged Nicola Sturgeon not to ldquodither like the Jacobites at Derby . Modern Scottish nationalists, like Nicola Sturgeon, loathe comparisons with Bonnie Prince Charlie and heroic failures like the lsquo. Nor is she an enthusiast for the politics of naive optimism.She knows that, evenopinion polls started showing a majority in favour of independence, Theresa May is not going to allow another referendum in the foreseeable future. Westminster must pass a so-called Section  Order to legitimise a referendum on the constitution, and the PM made clear last year that shersquos not going to table one. MPs would probably reject itshe did. For her part, Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly made clear she will not entertain any illegal referendums, not least because Unionists would boycott them, as in Catalonia in .This is not going to change any time soon. In her ldquonow is not the time interview in March , Mrs May gave three reasons for refusing a Section . First, that voters are confused right now second, that a second independence referendum would interfere with negotiations over Brexit and third, that Scots need to know what the future relationship with the EU is going to be before making up their minds about relations with the UK. Ms Sturgeon agrees that the ldquofog of Brexit as she put it yesterday, has to clear before any sensible choice can be made about Scottish independence. That ldquotriple mandate for independence,she won last year is not enough.But will the fog clear  EvenMrs May s with an acceptable exit deal before Christmas, the confusion over Brexit will be far from over. Any deal with Brussels will be limited to the orce bill, EU citizensrsquo rights and the Irish backstopand this will not be the end of Brexit uncertainly. It wonrsquot even be the end of the beginning.The latest version of the Chequers deal,appears to involve the UK remaining in the Customs Union until a ldquofriction-free solution emerges to trade across the Irish border. This is the so-called ldquoblind Brexit under which Britain leaves the EU in March without any clarity about future trading relations. It suits hard Brexiters because once wersquore out, wersquore out.But this half-in-half-out arrangement is not just confined to the transition period, which is supposed to end in . Indeed, it will almost certainly continue after that. My reading of the negotiations is that Britain is heading towards a ldquoSwitzerland minus outcome. The Swiss are not members of the EU, or the EEA or formally the European Single Market. However, they accept all the rules of the ESM on a ldquobilateral basis, meaning that they accept changes as they come along, not en masse, as it were.Itrsquos a fine distinction, and most people agree that Switzerland is in the single market for all intents and purposes. It accepts the four freedoms, including freedom of movement, and largely rubber-stamps rulings of the European Court of Justice. However, it is not actually in the ESM, which makes it Brexit-compliant. Mrs May will try to get a Switzerland-type deal, minus any formal acceptance of freedom of movement. But this will likely be fudged over a y transition in which the destination will be clear, but neither side will openly admit it.Except for Ms Sturgeon, who will want to call a spade a spade. If there is a transition deal that explicitly confirms regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland with the single market ndash which is what the ldquohybrid backstop also seems to involve ndash she will rightly call for Scotland to get parity. The Northern Ireland back-stop is similar to the hybrid arrangement she proposed for Scotland in the Scottish Government White Paper, Scotlandrsquos Place in Europe, back in . .But the downside is that Brussels and the UK could end up with an open-ended transition period in which Britain is out of the European Union, but remains in an uncertain relationship to its institutions. This means Scottish voters could be no clearer on our long-term relations with Europe than they are now. This purgatory could easily last  years, during which no UK government will agree to an independence referendum for Scotland, on the grounds that nothing is clear until everything is clear.I suspect realisation that the fog of Brexit is going to linger helped persuade the First Minister, belatedly, to support a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit. On the BBC Andrew Marr show she made clear SNP MPs will vote for a repeat referendum on Brexit, eventhere is no guarantee of indyref. The polls may indicate that support for independence would rise with a hard Brexit, but it is much better for the cause of Scottish independencethe UK doesnrsquot leave the EU at all. It would mean Scotland could seamlessly depart from the UK without there being any hard border with England, and without Scotland having to formally leave the EU.There is now a slim chance that a Peoplersquos Vote might happen. That Britain will wake up from the Brexit nightmare.

Only  living there now - the lowest in several years.Round-the-clock electricity also comes  years after the island faced complete evacuation, like the Hebrides archipelago of St Kilda.But in  the islandrsquos owner, George Waterson, founded the Bird Observatory, which helped to bring in visitors and boost the economy.In , Waterson also sold the island to the National Trust for Scotland, which helped to modernise housing and improve transportation.And while the population is still considerably smaller than its previous peak height of almost , new people and ideas are helping to keep the islandrsquos community sustainable.Around  people now live on Fair Isle and Islanders have always stressed, however, that the hardships of le there require people of a practical nature.One of Britainrsquos most remote inhabited islands, Fair Isle is raised by precipitous clfs.It is served by a -minute plane flight or a two-and-a-half hour ferry from mainland, Shetlandrsquos main island.But despite its remoteness, the island draws hundreds of visitors a year, mainly ornithologists, as it is one of the best places in Europe to see rare birds make pit stops along their migration routes in spring and autumn.Pharologists are also keen visitors as the island is home to two working lighthouses, both built by the famed Stevenson engineering family.Project leaders hope -hour electricity will support future growth of the islandrsquos community.ldquoThe new energy system will be cleaner and greener and will reduce reliance on expensive diesel, hence making living costs more sustainable, said Mr Mitchell.ldquoItrsquos an ambitious project and is another step in ensuring that the community of Fair Isle continues to thrive.Most islanders have a croft, supplemented by a ersity of business activity but internet speeds are slow.Since the s, it has been powered by two on-island turbines and two diesel generators. However, the kW and W turbines have both been out of action for the last year due to technical problems and a lightning strike.The new system was backed by pound. million from the Scottish Government and pound, from development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise.Other contributors include the European Regional Development Fund, Shetlands Islands Council and the National Trust for Scotland.Welcoming the new electricity supply, Scottish Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse said: ldquoThose of us living on the mainland of Scotland can often take reliable supplies of electricity for granted.ldquoThis has never been possible for the islanders of Fair Isle.ldquoThe reality of having, for the first time in their history, -hour supplies of electricity presents exciting prospects for the Fair Isle community, who will not only benefit from access to a reliable electricity supply around the clock, but also now have in place a new cleaner, greener energy system."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-boat-show-casts-off-at-inverkip-for-weekend-of-fun","story":"Thousands of people are expected to attend Scotlandrsquos Boat Show across the weekend at Kip Marina in Inverclyde to view everything from dinghies to powerboats.The event has attracted the biggest and best names in the business for the exhibitions.Storm Callum has brought some changes to the early schedule, but RYA water sessions are planned to go ahead on Saturday and Sunday.Today sees a am start with talks and viewings for latest equipment and trends, ask the expert sessions, live cookery demonstrations and more.On land, the Shore Display area will also allow visitors to look at everything from Powerboats to Porsches.The weekend, partnered by The Herald, will also feature a fashion show, boat sales, safety demonstrations, competitions and activities for kids.Further details can be found at http:www.scotlandsboatshow "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-insists-she-would-never-agree-to-brexit-deal-that-trapped-uk-into-permanent-backstop","story":"Downing Street made the declaration after it was suggested that several Cabinet ministers, following a briefing with the Prime Minister, were alarmed by the prospect of a proposal to keep all of the UK in the EU customs union until a trade deal was signed, which they fear would in fact go beyond the end of the transition period and in effect become a permanent position.But a No  spokeswoman said: \"The Prime Minister would never agree to a deal which would trap the UK in a backstop permanently.\"She explained that Mrs May stood by the terms of her June proposal for a backstop arrangement for the Irish border, to take effect onlya broader trade assessment had not been finalised.The June document proposed that the whole of the UK would remain within a customs union until a deal on the future economic relationship was in place but made clear that Britain expected this would happen by the end of December .The spokeswoman added: \"Our position is that this future economic relationship needs to be in place by the end of December  at the latest.\"On Thursday, David Mundell stressed how the backstop plan was only a fall-back guarantee should a trade deal not be completed by the end of the transition period and that the hope was it would never have to be implemented.But he made clear thatit were enacted, it had to be time-limited a proposal which Brussels has rebuffed, insisting any backstop has to be a permanent arrangement.Mr Mundell said: ldquoWhat is important is to recognise what we are talking about is a backstop provision.

Any pleas in mitigation of the kind that black people were deemed to be fair game in a more barbaric and uncivilised world fall in the face of the many who knew, even then, that this was a vile trade.Last week, Professor Sir Tom Devine, Scotlandrsquos foremost historian, published his long-awaited history of the Clearances that transformed the economic, cultural and physical landscape of Scotland in the th and th centuries. The Scottish Clearancesbears witness to an evil closer to home in which multitudes of the poorest people in Scotland were forced ndash often brutally and without mercy ndash from the land that had sustained their families for centuries. The title alone has sparked controversy as it immediately challenges the long-held shibboleth that the Highlands and Islands bore an overwhelming majority of the forced clearances.In the opening sentence of his introduction to this work Professor Devine writes: ldquoI have thought, written and taught on several of the issues in this book for nearly  years. But this is the first time I have tried to bring all the parts of a fascinating historical jigsaw into a single framework. In the opinion of others it is his magnum opus. It also provides a final and exquisite stitching underpinning the tapestry woven through three of his other great Scottish histories: To the Ends of the Earth, Scotlandrsquos Empire and Independence or Union.Throughout his latest work Professor Devine challenges an assortment of other questionable narratives including the one that holds that the mass of depopulation in the Highlands was caused by the Clearancesand that it was mainly English landlordism and English factors who were responsible. None of this of course diminishes the full extent of the inhumanity and human greed that laid waste to entire communities across Scotlandanything it amplies them.The concept of reparative justice,applied to the Scottish Clearances, would be howled down by those families and institutions which benefited most from the greed and exploitation of their ancestors: ldquoIt was too long ago, ldquowhatrsquos to be gained, ldquoit only feeds a culture of grievance. You hear similar sentiments espoused by the landownersrsquo organisations which represent the  iniduals who own more than half of Scotland. That many of them benefited from illegal land grabs in an era of political, religious and judicial chaos seems never to have given them any cause to reflect on this let alone make amends. In any case, they aver, they are better stewards of the land and few but them know how to thrive in these wild places. They werenrsquot always wild though, and entire communities once lived in them.The University of Glasgow has pledged to initiate a y and sensitive journey of amendment not simply to acknowledge its slavery past but also ldquoto engage in the kinds of reparative justice most appropriate to a university based on Enlightenment ideals of truth and justice. This will include establishing deeper links with the University of the West Indies and funding exchange programmes and scholarships with communities throughout the Caribbean.The university was just one of many Scottish institutions which benefited from the proceeds of human wickedness and greed. How many banks, insurance companies, shipping firms, private schools and grand Scottish mansions ndash and the families who live in them ndash were also enriched because their ancestors treated black people worse than animals  If, in two yearsrsquo time none have felt the need to follow a similar course to that taken by the University of Glasgow then Scotlandrsquos claims to be a country where truth, justice and enlightened attitudes thrive will have been eroded.When injustice and inhumanity is permitted to occur on a grand scale only a small and powerful elite benefit. If theyrsquod had to share the proceeds of their dishonesty and cruelty they wouldnrsquot have bothered. This is why their descendants and the political causes they support are the loudest in protesting that any moves to denude them of some of the wealth they inherited from the reset of stolen goods. Yet no-onersquos asking them to pay it all back: nothing remotely like it. All that wersquod ask of them is that they undertake the same self-examination as the University of Glasgow and perhaps fund some social programmes for those who suffered most from their familiesrsquo dishonesty and brutality.Andthey refuse to do this voluntarily then perhaps an enlightened, liberal and socially progressive government like, oh, I donrsquot know ... like our SNP Government, could ensure that it happened anyway. A first step would be to establish a Justice Commission which would name and shame the modern-day beneficiaries of theft, murder and illegal land-grabs both here and in those countries where our ancestors caused so much suffering. An index of those families and institutions which were built on slavery and which have refused to acknowledge this must be established and published. Customers could then decidethey wanted to favour such institutions with their business.Another way, of course, would be simply to ensure that a preferential option for the descendants of those worst affected in Scotland underpinned our Governmentrsquos social policies. That is, of course,we want a sense of fairness to guide the way Scotland conducts its business."},{"url":null,"title":"alcohol-free-drinking-festival-targets-scotlands-heavy-drinking-over-50s","story":"Writing on the online forum Soberistas, \"Tfers\" outlines a common problem.

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting.

They say the closure of the toilets would have an environmental and economic impact. A coach tour firm cancelled a booking over concern for its customers needing comfort breaks.As previously reported, local businessman Andrew Mackay said the threat of toilet closures in Caithness could create \"a negative impression\" of the area and impact on the number of people visiting.Mr Mackay, who has hotels in Wick, Thurso and Castletown and is a board member of the tourism body Venture North, said: \"The perception that there is a shortage of toilets in Caithness ndash and where in the Highlands ndash could impact adversely on the area.\"Any negative publicity could have an effect on the industry. We have a short season and need to capitalise on all markets.\"Green MSP John Finnie recently accused the council of pressing ahead with the closure of toilets in the face of its own evidence that it could have an impact on public health. An equality impact assessment conducted into the proposals identied issues for older people, those with disabilities and pregnant women.Mr Finnie said: \"Despite this, the council leadership are determined to press ahead in their usual incoherent manner, ignoring procedures, policies and good practice.\"Given the clear implications for public health, and potential for increased instances of public nuisance, it is astonishing that the council has not discussed this matter with NHS Highland and Police Scotland.\"Saturday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117682.jpg","title":"Repair work set for next month after landslip on lifeline route","story":"CAITHNESS civic leader Willie Mackay has questioned the delay involved in repair work following the landslip at Helmsdale last month.Mr Mackay, who represents the Wick and East Caithness ward on Highland Council, said: \"I am a bit disappointed that it has taken so long ndash the A is a major leline road.\"He was speaking after Bear Scotland confirmed yesterday that repairs to the landslip are due to start at the beginning of October.\"I thought they might have moved a bit quicker.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision.

The new strategy will shape the country’s transport priorities for the next  years.Age Scotland and Transport Scotland have said they have been working closely with older people in communities across island, rural and urban Scotland since spring to understand how transport affects older peoples’ daily lives.Gillian Skuse, Charity Director of Age Scotland Orkney, stressed how important it is that local older people get involved in these discussions.“We’ve heard from older people around the islands that transport can impact their mobility, running their errands, enjoying activities and being part of their local communities. This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed. Tea and coffee will be available on arrival from . am with the day starting at . am.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online. In every case of a branch closing we are committed to providing the best possible range of alternatives.\"Saturday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I see a bright future for the town, now things are starting to move forward,\" she said.This was echoed by long-serving Invergordon hairdresser Sharon Mitchell. She agreed more houses were desperately needed but said more shops must follow because the town centre was sorely lacking its yesteryear \"buzz\".\"It used to be thriving here but itrsquos Alness thatrsquos thriving now.

Stem cell research hit the headlines earlier this week after Glaswegian comedian Sir Billy Connolly revealed he would participate in a pioneering Hard University study which aims to use stem cells to find a cure for Parkinson’s.

Aidan Courtney, chief executive at Censo, said: “This investment from Par Equity has come at exactly the right time for the company. “Over the past two years we have developed a comprehensive suite of resources which allow us to create human stem cells from any inidual and use derivatives of these cells to test drugs for clients. “Our focus on selected research areas, such as neuro-inflammation, has aligned extremely well with our clients’ needs and we are seeing more demand than we can accommodate with our current resources. “Par Equity’s investment will allow us to broaden our service offering and accelerate growth.”Paul Munn, partner at Par Equity, said: “Our investment gives Censo the capital to build upon its important work, but we’re also very active managers. “We’ll work closely with Censo’s management, drawing on the expertise and experience of our network of investors to give them the support they need to scale up this exciting business, which could help transform treatment of a number of serious diseases.”Censo was founded in  following the merger of Roslin Cellab and Roslin Cell Sciences, and has employs teamsin the Scottish capital and Cambridge.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4814564.1539378916!/image/image.jpg","title":"no deal brexit would wipe out trade deals with 70 countries","story":"A no-deal Brexit would cut the UK off from trade agreements with more than  countries, the government has admitted amid mounting tension within the cabinet as negotiations with Brussels enter their final stages.Trade with major economies including Japan, Canada and South Korea could face new tarfs and barriersthe UK fails to strike a Brexit agreement, according to the latest round of government papers on preparations for a no-deal scenario.The UK plans to ‘roll over’ existing EU trade agreements by striking new bilateral deals that are “identical or substantially the same” and keep foreign markets open to British goods.However, talks are so far only sufficiently advanced on two existing agreements covering southern and eastern African states.Papers published yesterday also reveal a no-deal Brexit could trigger a new ‘cod war’ with the EU as European fishing boats would no longer have any right to fish in British waters and could face enforcement action from UK government vessels.• : The best new TV and films on Netflix in October British fishermen would in turn no longer be able to fish in European waters or land catches in EU ports.

You’ve probably never heard of Picinisco but you’ve almost certainly eaten favourite dishes with roots stretching out from here.Nestled in the Abruzzi foothills of the Appenines, Picinisco has a population of just over , but punches well above its weight in the world. Up to , Scots have some Italian heritage and an estimated , of them have links to this one tiny town.In high summer, the population more than doubles as Scots-Italiansto their roots but even this week as the first chill winds of autumn arrived, I was surrounded by Scottish accents in the café in the main square looking over the valley. : Stephen Jardine: Why we should thank Jamie Oliver for not shutting upThis area was originally home to the I Ciaccas, the Continis, the Crollas and some of the other key names that have shaped Italian food in Scotland. Actor Peter Capaldi and violinist Nicola Benedetti also trace their roots back to the village. Choose carefully and you will find wine from the vineyards here on the menus of some of the best Italian restaurants in Scotland alongside dishes cooked in olive oil from trees on the slopes leading up to the piazza. When it came time to eat, the food in Picinisco turned out to be rather familiar. In a pizzeria on the edge of the village, I tried a sausage dish called Cotechino. It was made with pork rather than lamb but apart from that it looked and tasted just like haggis. On the wall above my table hung a set of Zampogna – Italian bagpipes. The table next door was occupied by a man who looked like he could only be Italian. Except Massimo turned out to be the owner of an Italian restaurant in Bearsden. : Stephen Jardine: Is the Michelin guide biased against Scottish food The Scottish connection is everywhere and impossible to miss and much more than a marketing exercise.What brought so many Italians to Scotland was a search for new opportunities and an escape from poverty but there are cultural links stretching way back in time. From the days of Robert the Bruce, Italian minstrels were retained at the Scottish royal court and where. They were followed by craftsmen who helped with the construction of Edinburgh’s New Town. And years later they were followed by the ancestors of today’s Scots Italian food families. Next year will mark the centenary of the journey that some of those who travelled to Scotland. They arrived with nothing except the recipes in their heads and an appetite for hard work. A hundred years on, their legacy touches many of us every day in the food we eat at home and where we choose to eat when we go out, evenJamie’s Italian has been struggling of late.The centenary celebrations will coincide with Brexit and fundamental changes to our relationship with Europe.

He said: “The landslides at the Rest and Be Thankful this week have been some of the most challenging in recent memory, both for the community and for the teams working in dficult conditions.“I saw for myself this morning the size of the challenge, with secondary slips complicating matters and delaying use of the Old Military Road ersion route.“It is a dynamic situation on the hillside.“There are warnings of further heavy rain and while every effort is being made to get traffic moving, today’s events reinforce the need for a safety-first approach.Elsewhere, Storm Callum continued to cause disruption across the road, rail and ferry network as rain and heavy winds battered much of western Scotland.A spokesman for Glasgow Airport said five outbound flights and five arrivals – all of which were on domestic routes – were cancelled yesterday.Several Caledonian MacBrayne services were cancelled, including crossings from Oban to Castlebay, and Mallaig to Armadale, while train services between Kilwinning and Largs and Ardrossan were suspended due to waves crashing over the sea wall at Saltcoats.Skye and Dornoch bridges were temporarily closed to high-sided vehicles, while high wind warnings were in place at the Kessock and Erskine bridges.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David.

The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring.

The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is.

But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles.

However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/p1-crop.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry. That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1077173.jpg--.jpg?1539084908000\n","title":"public mystified by disappearing planters","story":"LOCAL people have been mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church. Council simply said they are now being stored at a Council yard.Meanwhile people have also been concerned as to the whereabouts of the original town centre bandstand.The plan for this was for it to be re-established in the Peoples Park, however this has not yet happened.When thecontacted Council for a statement, they said: “We are delighted with the success to date of Harmony Hub – our borough’s newest and state-of-the-art outdoor entertainment venue.“Harmony Hub has showcased a wide range of talented local artists since it opened earlier this year and we look forward to welcoming more great performances and attractions.Speaking about the original bandstand, the Council confirmed they have plans for it.“The old bandstand was carefully dismantled so it can be preserved and relocated to the People’s Park.“We are currently working on plans for this installation and more information will be made available in due course.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1065046.jpg--.jpg?1538637007000\n","title":"tension in chamber over gaa dinner","story":"AN INVITE for councillors to a GAA gala dinner stoked up tensions in the Council chamber last week.A request from St Ergnats GAC to invite members of Mid and East Antrim to the Tullyglass on November  was read to members.It followed an item on the agenda with members being invited to a gala dinner in support of NI Childrens Hospice.Members had agreedthey were to attend the hospice dinner that they would purchase their own tickets.When the GAA dinner was raised Councillor Carson proposed to mark it as read as the club was not located in the Mid and East Antrim boundary lines.However Councillor Declan OLoan said the club was located in Moneyglass which fell very close to the border and that a lot of players at the club lived within the Mid and East Antrim Borough.He added: This is an outstanding club like many others in the area who raise a lot of money and doesnt depend on its council for support.I would propose we do the same for this as we are doing for the hospice.Councillor Gaston seconded Councillor Carsons proposal to mark the invitation as read.If anyone wishes to attend this they should go in their own capacity.Councillor Maguire added that the issue of location of the club should not come into the decision.He added: If I remember correctly some members of this Council attended a dinner in Lurgan or Portadown for the British Legion so that set a precedent.I would second what Councillor OLoan has said and treat this invite similar to that of the hospice dinner.Councillor Gaston added that both invitations were completely dferent.The Northern Ireland Hospice does sterling work and is for the benefit of people all over Northern Ireland.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics.

But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch. She was in the Banbridge branch for a while but she spent the longest time in the TSB, or First Trust as it became known, in Portadown where she was a Mortgage Sales Advisor.In Lisburn she was a business advisor for the Wallace High School Young Enterprise Team which won the NI Heat of the competition one year.She took early retirement in  and retrained as a professional make-up artist later working for Clarins initially at Debenhams in Rushmere and most recently Boots at Sprucefield.In Cindy’s younger years she was very involved in her local Church of Ireland at Tullylish in the Girls Brigade and as a Sunday School teacher.Her partner Alan said Cindy held strong religious beliefs. Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism. Cindy is the dearest partner of Alan, devoted mum of Aaron and Rachel, the cherished daughter of Joan and Richard Newell, treasured sister of Tracy and Julie, mother in law of Hannah, much loved Nanny C of Alfie and Alice. Her funeral is todayat pm in Tullylish Parish Church with committal following in the adjoining graveyard.The funeral dress code is not strictly black.

She said everBODY taught her mechanisms to cope with her illness.Action Mental Health’s Deborah McCready, everyBODY Project Worker said: “AMH everyBODY exists to bridge the gap on the clients’ journey from the moment they seek help until they eventually get to speak to a medical expert, as with existing waiting lists this can be a long time. AMH everyBODY offers a recovery approach in sessions when people will receive information and support to develop skills, stay focused and healthy until they see a therapist.” One service user said: “Speaking out is hard and you get scared that people will judge you, but for the first time I felt like somebody was listening to me and just got it. “I was able to get support for other underlying issues as well as my eating disorder and it helped having someone to explain how to access dferent types of support.AMH everyBODY Manager, Colin Loughran added: “This is a very practical model and one that could be used as a model of best practice throughout Northern Ireland.“There is a signicant shortfall in support services for people experiencing eating disorder and their families, prior to patients being seen by clinicians.“This new service will fill that gap giving people access to specially trained staff who will provide the vital support to help people in their recovery.”\"  \"  Happiest places in Northern Ireland revealed  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8667856.1539430479!/image/image.jpg","title":"too often the dedication of those working on frontline services goes unnoticed","story":"The unsung heroes of frontline service provision in communities across Northern Ireland have been celebrated at a gala event in Armagh.Councils throughout the province were represented as the nine award category winners of the  Local Government Awards were announced.

A second officer with responsibility for Ulster-Scots, sign language and other languages has also been appointed.The posts are jointly funded by Belfast City Council and Foras Na Gaeilge.The announcement was made during an event in City Hall presenting research by Conradh Na Gaeilge and the Committee on the Administration of Justice into how the north’s  councils are complying with their obligations with regard to the Irish language.Speaking at the launch Chief Executive of Belfast City Council Suzanne Wylie said: “I am absolutely delighted to be here today to celebrate the Irish language officers scheme and to welcome our Irish Language Officer Colm Mag Uiginn.“We also have our Irish Language Pfficers from Fermanagh, Omagh, Derry and Strabane here as well. It’s also great to see representatives from the Irish language community here today.“This council, earlier on this year under a dferent Mayor, launcheda five-year language strategy and we are now seeing the practical out-workings of that strategy including the appointment of the Irish Language Officer.“On behalf of myself and the other councils who have benefited from this scheme we thank Foras Na Gaeilge for this initiative.”Ms Wylie added: “Languages are something to be celebrated. Belfast has a close association with the Irish language, many of our place names are taken from Irish language whether it’s Béal Feirste, Bóthar na bhFál or Bóthar na Seanchille, Belfast heritage has got an enduring relationship with the Irish language going down centuries.“I think in many ways Irish speakers in Belfast were pioneers. Today we acknowledge the Irish language community here, in this city and across the north.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"festival frolics to cheer us up","story":"THE announcement by Teesie May on the eve of the Tory conference that there’s to be a Festival of GB and OWC in  has, not surprisingly, split the Pravince down the middle. On the one side are those who think that an orgy of union jack-waving to the strains of Land of Hope and Glory is an excellent idea on the other side are those with a titter of wit.Squinter can recall two similar Ulsterfests in his letime, both of them when he was a youngster. The most recent one was the queen’s  silver jubilee, when Britain vos celebratink der th anniversary von der coronation von Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Loyal Ulster being loyal Ulster, it ended up cheering loudest and, West Belfast being West Belfast, we decided to celebrate the auspicious occasion with a non-stop summer of rioting as a result of which Squinter’s right arm remains sore to this day.The earlier one was the rather creepy and sinister ‘Ulster ’’ – a celebration of  years of partition that was held on land between Botanic Park and the Stranmillis Embankment. The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch . Which might make a bit more sense."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"johnnies havent missed the boat insists mcnulty","story":"ST JOHN’S and Cushendall lock horns again this Sunday at Ballycastle two weeks on from their thrilling drawn semi-final in Dunloy.Cushendall battled back from being five points down in the closing stages to take the lead following a late free from Neil McManus. Yet, Ciaran Johnston had the final say on proceedings to nail a free under intense pressure and in the face of a strong cross-field wind. As the underdogs, some may feel that St John’s had their chance the first day as favourites have a habit of winning replays. However, St John’s manager Tony McNulty sees it dferently and has urged his side to make to most of Sunday’s second chance to reach the county final. “We just took our foot of the pedal in the last few minutes. I said before the game that we had to play for  or  minutes and we only played for  minutes,” said McNulty. “We were four or five points ahead late on and we just switched off. “We switched off long enough for them to get their goal and it was nervous at the end. While we scored to draw the game, we felt we had done enough to win the game. “We’ll not be going into this match thinking we’ve missed the boat. “When Neil McManus hit that free I though “here we go again” – thankfully Ciaran Johnston stepped up and scored his free. We were disappointed having led not to hold on.“We can’t afford to switch off again – Cushendall are too good. When you have players like Neil McManus, Arron Graffin and Alex Delargy, we can’t afford to. I can’t see there being much in the game again this Sunday.” McNulty also gave his views on the worrying scenes which marred the end of the match when two Cushendall supporters jumped over the wire at Dunloy to confront the St John’s players in the dying minutes of the game. With such incidents in the spotlight in recent weeks, the intruders could have sparked a much more serious flashpoint, but order was soon restored. While McNulty condemned the actions of those involved, he feared the game might have been brought to a premature end with his side one point in arrears at the time. “There was a bit of carryon at the sideline which had nothing to do with us,” reflected McNulty “The ball was in among four or five Cushendall men and one of their players pulled on it.“He hit his own player and one of our players. It resulted in a bit of pushing – nothing serious. “Two of their supporters jumped over the wire. “I don’t know why, but they started throwing punches until the players got them off the pitch. “I was glad the referee continued the game and gave us the chance to equalise and thankfully the people were identied.” It is believed that the Cushendall player who was struck by his own teammate was Antrim ace Eoghan Campbell, who is likely to miss Sunday’s replay as a result of the hand injury sustained late in the drawn encounter. St John’s will also be without one of their leading players for the remainder of the campaign after attacker Donal Carson departed for Australia last week, but Simon McCrory is expected to be fit to play a greater role in the replay having played the second half in the drawn game. “Donalis away to Australia so that’s a big blow for us,” added McNulty. “I don’t know what happened, but there was something about the dates and he couldn’t get them changed. “It is unfortunate because he has been playing well for us. “In nearly every game, he has scored a goal for us. If Campbell is out for them, it evens things up a bit. “Simon McCrory should be good to go. He is a super player for us and he has been outstanding in every game he has played this year. He wasn’t right for the last game. All being well, the two-week break will do him good.” McNulty will also have the task of lting the dual players in the club following their semi-final football defeat at the hands of Creggan last Sunday. Senior finalists in , the Johnnies were edged out - to - by Kevin Madden’s men at Glenavy, but McNulty, whose son Ryan is a key member of both squads, doesn’t think the dual players will suffer any hangover from that defeat. “We are disappointed, but we have to hang in,” stated the Johnnies boss. “We didn’t play as well as we can do on Sunday, so we can have no complaints. “Things conspired against us on the day. Simon McDonagh’s we went into labour on Sunday morning so he was unavailable. Peter McCallin wasn’t back from holiday in time. “We had six or seven dual players in action on Sunday who will feature again this weekend. “They’ll lt themselves up alright. “It would have been great to going into the match trying to reach two senior finals, but we have to focus on Sunday’s game now.” With Division One winners and  champions Dunloy out following their surprise loss to Loughgiel, the remaining sides will all fancy their chances of lting the Volunteer Cup later this month. The Shamrocks will get a chance to view their final opponents over the course of  minutes in Ballycastle on Sunday, but it would come as no great surprisean additional  minutes was required to separate St John’s and Cushendall."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"roisins relief as decision to deny pip is overturned","story":"THE delighted father of West Belfast woman Roisin McWilliams has spoken of his relief after his daughter’s PIP knockback was overturned.Last month the Andersonstown News spoke with Tom McWilliams in his Twinbrook home as he told us the heartbreaking story of his -year-old daughter’s courageous battle with stage  Hodgkin#s lymphoma and how the mother of one was refused PIP on the grounds that she could cook for herself, administer her own medication and plan a journey.An emotional Tom said yesterday: “It was such a relief to us as a family to find out that Roisin’s PIP decision had been overturned and she would also be awarded money owed, this has taken a lot of pressure off her and we can now focus on the future and getting her well again.”Last week Roisin also got more news she was waiting for – funding for her new immune therapy treatment has been granted and she underwent her first session in recent days.Tom said: “I have no doubt that the media pressure surrounding Roisin’s case has helped and I want to thank each and every single person who has taken the time to wish us well and support us. We also cannot thank Ciaran Cunningham of Michael Brentnall Solicitors enough for his help with getting this disgraceful decision overturned.“Roisin still has a huge battle ahead of her but we believe this new treatment will be successful, her new treatment is very tough on her, Roisin’s cancer is a very fast growing cancer, her new treatment is making her very lethargic and it has nasty side effects but she is prepared, she knows what she is up against and she will continue to fight.”"},{"url":null,"title":"3k for northern ireland man told he was too old for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Ms Kitson added: \"That goes to the heart of the case and it quite rightly caused Mr Matier major disappointment at a time when he was attempting to re-enter the workplace in very trying circumstances.\"No employer should be making assumptions about a persons ability, or suitability for training and promotion, because of their age.\"Spring  AirbrakeLtd said it was \"extremely disappointed\" with the decision and will be applying to have it reviewed.It said: \"This decision sets a very dangerous precedent for any employer defending claims of discrimination, in that the tribunal determined that the claimant was discriminated against, despite ascertaining that the evidence of the claimant was a little imprecise and vague.\"On behalf of the respondents, we will be applying to have this decision formally reviewed.\"We also intend writing to the Department for Communities seeking a review of their recruitment services. \"The respondent followed the approved process for advertising their vacancy with the Jobs and Benefits Office and strictly adhered to the procedure.\"The company said the absence of an employment appeal tribunal led to an \"imbalance\".It added: \"Should a review fail to address the shortcomings of this decision, the only avenue open to the respondent is to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal, which for any company is extremely prohibitive financially.\""},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster eu spin on offer suggested ni would have best of both worlds that was a lie we would not","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

We had a series of meetings arranged with representatives of the EU as well as the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. .pushIt was in that meeting with Michel Barnier and his team that we received a very clear outline of the type of post-Brexit arrangement the EU envisioned for Northern Ireland.The deal on offer was certainly unique but as the first State to leave the EU club, any deal will be unique. The EU spin on this offer suggested that Northern Ireland would have the best of both worlds ­— ie we would have full access to the EU single market and full access to the UK single market. That was a lie. We would not.Under the EU’s plan, Great Britain-based businesses would have a barrier when they would seek to trade with Northern Ireland. Such a barrier cuts right to the heart of what is at stake here. The United Kingdom is one nation. There should not be international-style borders within it.I am a unionist. I became involved in politics to build a better Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Back in June , when we agreed a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservative Party, central to it was helping Northern Ireland financially but also the entire United Kingdom. I want every part of the United Kingdom to prosper.I would not tolerate a trade barrier between England and Wales any more than I would tolerate one between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The dangers to the Union and our single market were clearly demonstrated by how quickly the SNP demanded the same for Scotland as was offered to Northern Ireland.  Countries like the United Kingdom have some regional iations but what is held in common is what is fundamental to make their national markets work. We may pay lower rates here than council tax in England. Dferent states in the USA would be the same. However, what is made in each part can be sold within those countries without extra barriers.Indeed, unionists who voted Remain have contacted me to express their vehement opposition to any deal which would limit Northern Ireland’s access to the United Kingdom single market.However, it would be wrong to think that the DUP are the only people in Parliament who see the EU’s proposal as unacceptable. ‘No sea border’ has support across the House of Commons.  I believe that the Prime Minister is in her own beliefs a committed unionist. However, she should learn from her previous female predecessor, Margaret Thatcher. Despite her unionist convictions, others persuaded Thatcher to sign the Anglo-Irish Agreement. She later deeply regretted the choice she had made. However, we do not want nor need the regrets of another Prime Minister. We want the right choices made. We want her to stand by her principles and instincts rather than accepting a dodgy deal foisted on her by others.  I fully appreciate the risks of a ‘no deal’ but the dangers of a bad deal are worse. If true to her principles Mrs May would not and should not choose the path to effectively cut Northern Ireland adrt.  The DUP’s actions this week are not as some have suggested about ‘flexing muscle’. This is no game.  Anyone engaging in this in a light-hearted way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we will make in the coming weeks.  Over time the gap between UK regulations and EU regulations would only grow. With double red tape for businesses, such an arrangement would add costs for businesses and consumers.This backstop arrangement would not be temporary. It would be the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland away from the rest of the United Kingdom and forever leave us subject to rules made in a place where we have no say.  The coming days, weeks and months will be critical. The decisions taken will shape the type of Northern Ireland that our grandchildren will live in.The DUP will have teams in London, Brussels and Belfast meeting key influencers to ensure our position is fully understood and upheld.On Monday, I will travel to Dublin for a range of meetings. We want a deal which respects Northern Ireland’s constitutional position but one that also works for our nearest neighbours in the Republic of Ireland.  Yesterday when we met our MPs and MLAs collectively, people were united behind our plan and united in standing firm not just for Northern Ireland but for the Union. I reminded people that the stand we are taking is not about the party, this is about the Union and the shape of the United Kingdom for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"ashers photographers booked for gay cake case refuse to hand over images","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

told the court on Friday: “Ithas thrown up issues that justied a full-blown review of how these trials are conducted.” He presented a detailed argument to court for Mr Olding to retrieve his costs.Mr O’Donoghue made a claim there was ineptitude in the case.He claimed the prosecution had a “flawed understanding of the facts”.“The police got it wrong, and with respect, the prosecution got it wrong,” he told the court.“Mr Olding lost the chance that he is entitled to, to have his case properly considered.”Mr O’Donoghue referred to evidence given during the trial by witness Dara Florence.“The strength of Dara Florence’s evidence was such that it must have been apparent to everyone, how could anyone possibly convict Stuart Olding in light of the evidence of Dara Florence,” he said.“How could anyone be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on that evidence.”Mr O’Donoghue told the court it was “entirely foreseeable” that the case against his client would fail.He also described Mr Olding’s behaviour as exemplary.“His level of co-operation was %, he wasn’t the author of his own misfortune,” he said.The hearing about costs was held in front of Judge Patricia Smyth, who oversaw the trial.Judge Smyth said: “This is a complex legal issue and that means whatever decision I reach has to be made with proper consideration.”Mr Olding did not attend the hearing on Friday, which was adjourned after two hours.It is set to resume on October  when counsel for the PPS will respond.Mr Jackson has also applied for legal costs.His legal team made its case to Belfast Crown Court in May.A

This started in Lancashire and we are going to finish this in Lancashire.“I’d like to say a really big thank-you to our legal team, they have worked so hard for so long.“We didn’t get the result we were looking for, but we will fight on.”"},{"url":null,"title":"uk government planning brexit extension to appease dup reports","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Master Cadets must successfully complete a demanding course designed to broaden and develop further the leadership, instructional and administrative responsibilities of senior Cadets who have already attained the prestigious Four Star Army Proficiency Certicate.The certicates were presented recently by Gillian Bingham, High Sherf of County Antrim.Congratulating the young people, Colonel Sam McCammond, Commandant of the ndBattalion Army Cadet Force, said: ldquoWe are delighted to see the enthusiasm and commitment of our Cadets recognised with the achievement of these latest accolades.ldquoWe are enormously proud of them and, indeed, they are each a credit not only to their detachments, but also to their families, schools and the wider community.ldquoAt a time when society tends to be quick to find fault with the younger generation, these young people are demonstrating great qualities and it is an absolute pleasure to see them reap the rewards of their hard work and sense of purpose.Col McCammond said the Cadet movement offers its members ldquogreat fun and camaraderie and also ldquoopens the door for signicant personal development.He continued: The awards which these Cadets, drawn from detachments at Down High School, Banbridge, Ballygowan and Killyleagh, collect today celebrate their progress and give our Cadets something truly signicant to put on their personal statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs.ldquoI congratulate them and the adult leaders who inspire and instruct them..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown until doors open at new Down Leisure Centre  ","story":"THE new poundm Down Leisure Centre will open at the end of next month.The stunning three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels and has the ldquowow factor Newry, Mourne and Down Council always promised it would have.Stretching across , square metres, council officials have no doubt the futuristic building will be the envy of many and viewed as an exemplar for others.The new centre features a  metre, six-lane swimming pool, a teaching pool with moveable floor, relaxation area with sauna, steam room and vitality pool along with a four-court multi-use sports hall.There is also a fantastic fitness suite with an extensive selection of equipment with some items the first of their kind to feature in any leisure centre in Ireland. The new centre also has two multi-purpose exercise studios featuring hi-tech spinning bikes.Council officials have this week set out the programme for closing the current leisure centre and opening its stunning replacement.Itrsquos anticipated that the existing leisure centre mdash which has long since passed its sell-by date mdash will close early next month. The new centre is expected to open three weeks later.When the door closes on the current facility, which will be subsequently bulldozed to pave the way for the construction of an expansive new car park, staff will transfer to the new multi-million pound centre for dedicated training and induction.Council officials are drawing up a programme ahead of the official opening to provide members of sports clubs and the public with an opportunity to sample what the new st century leisure centre has to offer and a chance to view its high-tech equipment.It is hoped the new centrersquos public launch will take place over the weekend of November  and  with full public access from November . These dates have to be confirmed.During the transition from the old centre to its modern replacement, the public are asked to use the local authorityrsquos nearby facilities at the Ballymote Health and Well-Being Centre in Downpatrick and the Newcastle Centre.Council officials are delighted with the new centre, in particular, the new teaching pool which has a moveable floor.Over recent years, there has been increasing pressure on swimming classes at Down Leisure Centre.Council officials are confident this will soon ease and are grateful to the public for their patience during the construction process.There are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room mdash the new leisure complexrsquos nerve centre mdash resembling something akin to a science fiction film set.Council director Michael Lipsett has described the new centre as a ldquofantastic building which people will appreciate and enjoy. He said it will also be a pleasure for the local authorityrsquos leisure staff to move to a modern building.The senior council official said everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially, deserve credit for the part they played..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down High pupils make waves at RYA  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos sailors took to the water at the weekend with over  others to battle it out at the RYA Northern Ireland Youth Championships and Schools Cup at Cultra.The sailors from the Downpatrick school battled hard in tough conditions, with a special mention to going to Adam Fermor, sailing in the Laser Standard fleet, who made a clean sweep, with five first place podium finished from five races.Evie Mclaughlin also performed impressively, finishing as third lady overall, in the Laser Radial Fleet.

Itrsquos important we give riders some idea how to handle their machines.ldquoIrsquove had teachers from schools in Newcastle and Ballynahinch ands members of local road safety committees all expressing interest in the idea, he told the Recorder this week.ldquoWe are waiting now to hear the police reaction and then we can get together and work out something definite.Mr McBridersquos concern comes with a rising number of motorcycle accidents in the province. In the Ballynahinch area alone there have been several serious accidents this year.Among the proposals he has suggested to augment his own coaching course is specially built lsquotrail parksrsquo and an elementary riding test before anyone is allowed to buy a machine.ldquoPeople must know how to ride their machines safely, he said. Balance and technique are important.ldquoAnother important area is maintenance.

Four members, Billy Ogle, Felton Williamson, Sam Harrison and Joe Toland were flagged off from the Slieve Donard Hotel to start their marathon visitation around Ireland.Every Round Table in Ireland will be visited and a competition has been organised to guess the number of miles the journey will take.

Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction. He permitted a Down Recorder photographer to visit the scene and had no objections to the crime being publicised.HOLLYWOOD mdash The widely-held belief that Hollywood actress Greer Garson was born and bred in Down District has been scotched.

It is turning into death-trap with dficult turning circles that intrude on pedestrians and oncoming traffic, she explained.ldquoThe meeting with roads officials took place at .am so they were able to see the situation for themselves with everybody having to demonstrate nimble footwork, ing out of the way of oncoming traffic.Cllr Enright said the pavement currently ran only half way up Racecourse Hill and the road was not wide enough for two-way traffic.ldquoRoads officials have agreed to a one-way system which will allow vehicles to drive down the hill when a new pavement is in place.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Cllr Andrew Muir Responding to questions from the News Letter, the Alliance Party representative didn’t sayhe agreed with the ruling handed down by the Supreme Court justices, but stressed he would have preferred to see the case resolved through mediation.Mr Lee ordered the £. cake from Ashers Baking Company’s Belfast store as a gt for Councillor Muir, who was hosting the event in Bangor to mark International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia. But the company’s refusal to produce the cake sparked a discrimination complaint that spiralled into a four-and-a-half year legal row that made headlines across the world.Mr Lee’s complaint was backed by The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, but the McArthurs denied discriminating against him, arguing that they’d refused to make the cake because the ‘Support Gay Marriage’ message went against their firmly held religious beliefs.After being found guilty of discrimination by a County Court judge in Belfast and ordered to pay damages of £ – a ruling upheld by the Court of Appeal – the UK Supreme Court this week overturned those findings and ruled that Ashers, who were backed in their case by The Christian Institute, hadn’t discriminated against Mr Lee and were entitled to refuse the cake order.The court’s ruling has been widely welcomed as a victory for freedom of conscience, but it has also sparked stinging criticism of the taxpayer-funded Equality Commission and calls for its chief commissioner to resign.Reacting to the fallout from the case, which has so far cost an estimated £,, Cllr Muir said: “As a Christian gay man I have been very saddened by the polarised debate which has ensued in recent days following the judgement. Both the Alliance Party and I would have preferred that this case be resolved through mediation rather than the courts. “The issues concerned are complex with careful reflection of the judgement required to ensure anti-discrimination legislation is upheld on all grounds, including political opinion, sexual orientation and religious belief, while respecting the right to freedom of religion and from religion.”Stressing that he respects “the independence of the Equality Commission and their work to ensure equality for all”, Cllr Muir said all forms of discrimination and intolerance against LGBT people must be challenged and rejected by everyone without equivocation.Scrap the Irish border backstop, Boris Johnson urges prime minister in News Letter article Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

When was the last time he visited or was here on the th July  Likewise, the unprecedented crisis schools are facing here cannot be fixed with merely encouraging pupils to ‘try harder.’”Speaking on yesterday’s BBC Talkback programme, Irish News columnist Brian Feeney said Mr Hepburn knows “nothing whatsoever about this place,” and added: “I think the less the Orange Order has to do with educating young people the better. It’s just a silly suggestion and no one is going to take it seriously.”Rev Gibson said one of his main goals since joining the institution has been “raising the culture of education and raising the value of education,” He added: “We are already involved in education. We have a full-time education officer, we have schools visit our museums quite regularly from all sectors and we engage with them. Everybody in their own community has a role in raising educational attainment, but I think the Orange Order has a particular role within the Protestant community to do this.”Hillary Clinton tells Northern Ireland parties to put their quarrels aside Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

internal opponents that she will not be walking away from theDUP leadership after a series of criticisms of the party emerged at an unusually forthright meeting of the DUP executive in Omagh last week.Over recent weeks there have been rumours of a potential challenge to Mrs Foster before the party’s annual conference at the end of next month.Power within the party has shted from Stormont – where Mrs Foster has now not been firstminister for almost two years – to Westminster, while the tide of revelations from the RHI Inquiry have exposed problem after problem in how theparty has been run.But Mrs Foster’s stance at the meeting last Thursday night suggests that there is scant chance of her deciding to vacate her position voluntarily and her internal critics will have to launch a formal challenge – something which has never happened in the history of the DUP –she is to be removed.The News Letter understands that during the meeting, which lasted for about two hours and involved about  people, Mrs Foster and the wider party leadership faced criticism on at least three fronts – the revelations about the party’s role in the RHI scandal, the issue of Spads and her attendance at a GAA match.Many of those who spoke out at the meeting were councillors, a group of people particularly concerned about the public perception of the party because they face the electorate next May.One DUP member who was at the meeting told this newspaper that Mrs Foster had set out how she planned to make changes to respond to some of the unhappiness and that those who spoke in support of, or opposition to, her were “usual suspects” on either side, rather than a sudden sht in people’s positions.Another inidual said that the meeting had involved “a lot of grumbling” while another described it as “very acrimonious”.He said that Lord Morrow, who was chairing the meeting, “tried to close down the debate” about RHI but was unable to due to the strength of feeling in the room.He described the meeting – which began with prayer and a scriptural exhortation – as “brutal” and said that there was loud applause for criticisms of the party.However, he said that Mrs Foster had made her intentions clear, with words to the effect of “I’ll be going nowhere”.There were also indications of what are now clearly delineated internal fault lines.At one point North Antrim councillor John Finlay complained about the handling of the RHI scandal, prompting a sharp rebuke from where in the room, with someone calling out that he was in no position to talk, given the scandal surrounding North Antrim MP Ian Paisley Jr, in whose defence Mr Finlay has publicly spoken.Scrap the Irish border backstop, Boris Johnson urges prime minister in News Letter articleMan and woman killed in A crash Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"One of those present said that Foster had been was “pretty defiant the whole way through” but that the meeting had been unusually uncomfortable.However, another member said that although the meeting had involved plain speaking, the fact that it had been held in a way that allowed an open internal debate about issues which are clearly concerning party members was a positive and a sign of change from the days of Peter Robinson’s leadership.He said: “We now have more frequent party executives – the executive was pretty much forgotten about under Peter. “The reason this [the blunt criticism] could happen is because Arlene is willing to have debate.“A lot of the stuff about RHI is about how Peter wanted the world to work and Arlene Foster is being pilloried for the way that the party operated under Peter.”Among those to speak in defence of Mrs Foster were two of her staunchest allies in the Assembly, Peter Weir and Christopher Stalford.A DUP spokesman declined to comment on what had transpired at last week’smeeting.try catch     .

It seems London is about to accede to the demand that Dublin laid out so explicitly thenBen LowryEmail Published::Saturday  October Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Columnists\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .html  .html.valTo get a sense of how serious events are for Northern Ireland, you only need to look at the top of this page .Sammy Wilson’s quote  is taken from an article that appeared in the News Letter this week, in which he made clear that the DUP was not bluffing in its preparedness to block a border in the Irish Sea.The tweet, top right , from Nick Boles MP, reveals the thinking of a pro BrexitTory in response to any perceived threat from the DUP to the Conservative Party Needless to say, this is not a good position for unionism to be in.For days there has been increasing speculation that the government is going to agree some sort of regulatory border in the Irish Sea, regardless of what the DUP thinks.It will also agree to the whole UK staying in the customs union.To understand how we have ended up in this extraordinary position, you need to go back not merely to the December ‘backstop’ on the Irish border, but a bit before it — to when the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney spoke to an SDLP breakfast in Belfast on November . What he said there gave a chillingdescription of how uncompromising Dublin was going to be on the land border.It is worth quoting at , because everything he vowed has so far held true, and so his comments are set out in the  below.If you read Mr Coveney’s comments, one thing becomes clear. The Irish government is not accepting regulatory or customs ergence at the land border, full stop.The backstop, agreed weeks later, gave Dublin comfort on that point .So this is not, repeat not, just about checks, as Mr Coveney made clear in his comments last year.Eventhere was wide acceptance of a technological solution to the land border and evenchecks were carried out in farmyards in Bangor or Ballyclare or Bushmills, to spare the sensitivities of nationalists who live in border areas, Dublin would not accept it.Claims of anti Catholic bias by the old Stormont regime are hugely exaggerated Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"That means that as far as the Irish government is concerned, Northern Ireland must always be in the EU custom and regulatory zone. You could even say that this whole saga has shown Irish acceptance of the principle of consent to be conditional .Now plenty of unionists reading all of the above, and Mr Coveney’s comments below, might think: fine, Ireland can think or say whatever it wants with regard to Northern Ireland, but that doesn’t mean it will get its way.That is all very wellyou have a British government that agrees. But it has become gradually apparent that we might not have such.Because, it seems, London is about to accede to the demand that Dublin laid out so explicitly last year. It is reported to be seeking a solution in which the whole UK stays in the customs union and NI stays in the single market until another deal can be struck . That ensures that the Irish demand is fully met, of no land border ergence, and the British vow to have no border in the Irish Sea is only partially met .It is a remarkable outcome, but it is also one that has been staring us in the face for months.Perhaps it won’t happen.Perhaps Downing Street will retreat. Perhaps Boris Johnson will prevail . Perhaps there will be no deal. Perhaps the UK will decide not to leave the EU.But it is looking like it might happen. A well informed source told me this week that London had already decided to face down the DUP on this — as it did with the second version of the backstop in December . EvenBrexiteers take charge and a Canada style free trade deal comes close to clearing parliament and the EU says no to Northern Ireland being part of it , the Brexiteers will have to be willing to stand up to that. Will they, or will they cut us adrt for a deal Unionism is in a very bad way: on legacy , on competence issues , on Brexit, on friendship .Dire events might force some sort of unionist unity on it quite soon.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorSimon Coveney’s  comments below:Last November, Simon Coveney spoke to the SDLP about how the border had changed over  years. He said: “ ... that painful journey that many of you have been involved in, the success of it essentially has been largely invisible ... It is a seamless relationship, livestock moves around, product moves around, people move around. And I, for one, am not going to be part of an Irish government that allows that progress to be reversed. And I will make that promise here, just like I will make it in Dublin and I will make it in Cork. “Anybody who thinks that we see this issue purely in trade terms, in terms of trade numbers, fundamentally misunderstands the depth of feeling in the context of the politics of the border and of course the politics of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement... And so what we have insisted upon, which seems to have raised the hackles of some, is a language which now says that it seems essential for us that the UK commit to ensuring that a hard border on the island of Ireland can be avoided by ensuring no emergence of regulatory ergence in those rules of the internal market and the customs union which are, and in our view will be in the future, necessary for meaningful north south cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the GFA. “That is the language of the EU task force that we have absolute solidarity on in relation to this and that is now why are in an awkward impasse,the truth be told ... If you have a dferent rule-book by which business operates in Northern Ireland versus Ireland, there is no way of avoiding border checks. That is the reality, whether those border checks happen on the border, or in business premises or in farmyards is a dferent issue, but as far as I am concerned that is all border infrastructure preventing free movement, preventing trade, undermining the relationships that have been built up over the last  years, and it’s about building barriers rather than bridges on this island and we won’t stand for it.”Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8667893.1539435860!/image/image.jpg","title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Boris Johnson essay: lsquoThe only way to put things right on Brexit and avoid Suez is to ditch the backstop on the Irish borderrsquoBritain#s fatal error was not to challenge the EU#s position that the only way to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland is for Northern Ireland to have the same regulations for trade as Ireland and the EU, writes BORIS JOHNSON in an exclusive essay for the News Letter: Opinion,     .PSNI confirms it still has some terrorist guns to use in legacy investigationsThe PSNI has confirmed that it still holds some paramilitary weapons and that it will hand them over to a proposed Historical Investigations Unit for criminal investigations.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It consists of three workshops: Creating a Winning Mind Winning in Communication and Winning in Business.It also includes a practical component participants must organise and produce a fundraiser event in their pub for a charity of their choice. To date the  Accelerators have raised more than pound, for UK charities between them.The guests were given a tour of the House of Commons before the main event, hosted by Luton MP Gavin Shuker. Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises. The fit-out specialist is seldom out of the headlines, whether it’s landed new contracts or winning awards. The company has ersied and grown in influence, with Mr McConville one of just two Northern Ireland business leaders joining Prime Minister Theresa May on an international trade mission to China.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/group_v2_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland building long term business partnerships","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by Ulster Business Eugene McKeever of McKeever Hotel Group, Bank of Irelands Gavin Kennedy, Bridgene McKeever of McKeever Hotel Group alongside Eamon McCay, Frylite, and Brian Connolly, Pinnacle Bank of Ireland UK has been backing Northern Ireland businesses across the generations. Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
