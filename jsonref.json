Any co-conspirators should not rest easy’.Meanwhile, it was reported yesterday that Epstein paid protection money to inmates to avoid being beaten up in jail in the weeks before he died.

There was also a shoe repairer, a dressmaker, a blacksmith, and then there was Clocky Wood – who, of course, fixed clocks.’Back then, the Clarke’s estate owned several houses in the village, where most of their 30 employees lived. ‘It was an agricultural village,’ says Mr Clarke, stressing the word ‘agricultural’.It’s clear why he does so, because the demographic of Horsted Keynes has completely changed.Mainly thanks to mechanisation, estates of such sizes barely require more than one or two full-time employees. Houses previously lived in by farm workers and those with associated trades are now inhabited by retirees or those who commute to London. Very few of those who live in Horsted Keynes therefore both live and work in the village, which can lead to a fracturing in community spirit.Someone who recognises that disintegration is Billy Dye, 59, a builder and roofer, who has lived in Horsted Keynes for 30 years.‘The village has lost its generational cohesion,’ Mr Dye tells me over a pint of Guinness in the Crown. ‘There used to be a tapestry of people who lived here. Young people can’t afford or don’t want to live here.’There is an element of dormitory town here.Mr Clarke’s son, Rufus, 48, feels that the way the relative newcomers live their lives has a direct impact on the demand for amenities.‘Many parents don’t seem to find the time to spend with their children in the evenings,’ he says. ‘They just go home and shut up shop. So there’s less of an incentive to use the amenities during the weekdays.’Rufus also believes supermarkets and the internet have fundamentally altered the way people shop, and therefore damaged local trade.‘Ten years ago, I was selling 130 lambs for people’s deep freezers,’ he says. ‘Now, I’m just about selling 20. People are driving to the supermarket every day.’Then of course, there is the stream of delivery vans from firms such as Ocado, Sainsbury’s and Tesco that can regularly be seen cruising around the village, the enemies of any local shop hoping to do better than break even.David Colville, 72, chairman of the parish council, has lived in the village for 12 years with his wife Wendy. Now retired from computer security, Mr Colville sups on a pint of Harvey’s and says: ‘The modern world is changing. There is very little local employment. The hourly bus service doesn’t really suit people who might need it to go to work, and it finishes at 7.30 at night. If you don’t own a car, it’s very difficult to live here.’Mr Colville and his wife chose Horsted Keynes because it was the ‘quintessential English village’.‘The local vicar even dropped around a welcome pack, which included information such as when bins were collected,’ he says.The village hasn’t had a vicar for five years, and the welcome packs are long since gone, as is the garage which was directly opposite the Colvilles’ bungalow.‘When I arrived, I thought, “Yippee, I can just drive across the road”,’ he says, ‘But the garage closed. Now I’ve got to get it to a garage in Haywards Heath six miles away.’One of the reasons the garage closed was the value of the site for residential development. Three houses now stand in its place.The butcher’s and hairdresser’s is now a house, as is one of the stores. The post office, which closed several years ago, is now part of a house. And so on – shops have been turned into living-rooms.The closure of the post office particularly sticks in Mr Colville’s craw. ‘The Government seems determined to do away with post offices,’ he bristles.This is an interesting point, because it suggests that the diminution in amenities is not only down to mechanisation, market forces, supermarkets, demography, and the internet, but also the powers-that-be.In May this year, MPs were warned that 2,500 post office branches could close down if the Government continued with its plan to end its subsidy of the network in 2021. The effect on many communities would be disastrous, as the post office provides so many services, including banking, bill payments, and of course, deliveries.As it happens, Horsted Keynes is lucky, as a mobile post office arrives in the village hall twice a week, which is a lifeline for many, but it is clearly less convenient.However, for the affluent members of the village, a post office is less of a necessity, as many big local supermarkets have sub-post offices. And of course, it is that influx of affluence that has driven up house prices.‘The idea of affordable housing is a joke,’ says Mr Colville. ‘Nothing is affordable in this village.’And as well as driving up prices, the people who do buy houses here would rather privately educate their children at one of the many nearby prep schools than use the village school – hence it is running well below capacity.It would be easy to be completely gloomy about Horsted Keynes, but there is a huge sense of community spirit.Everybody tells me that goodwill has replaced the loss of amenity, with ride-share schemes operating, and many people volunteering. A look through the parish magazine reveals a huge number of clubs and societies, and there are many events such as monthly lunch that costs just £4 per head, and an annual ‘horse race’ with hobby horses around the village green.‘I think this village is very special,’ says Mr Colville. ‘I don’t think that community spirit is that great elsewhere, but here it is.’Even with the lack of amenities, it would be unfair to write off Horsted Keynes as a village that has somehow died. Yes, it is nothing like as buzzing and bustling as it would have been even as recently as the 1990s, but there are enough people determined to keep things lively.However, that does rely on that magic word, ‘goodwill’.

New York’s politan Museum of Art described her objects as seeming “simultaneously familiar and novel”. Born in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1950, she trained in Farnham, Surrey (where she now lives), then at the Royal College of Art. Her approach grew from a formative period when she returned to Africa to learn about local ceramic practice. Magdalene Odundo: The Journey of Things, featuring 50 of her works alongside 100 contemporary and historic pieces from all over the world, chosen by the artist, is at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Norwich, until 15 December.You “hand-build” rather than using a wheel – can you explain the technique?Each work originates with a ball of clay which is gradually hollowed out and pulled upwards to create the walls of the pot. Short lengths of coil are added to build height. As each piece rises, it is sculpted inidually to create the distinctive silhouettes. Unlike throwing on a wheel, where the piece of clay is worked mechanically and shaped by relatively stable hands, I am the one moving around the work, or moving a turntable to shape each aspect of the form.Your pieces are based on the human form – why?Using the human form is a very natural way of sculpting with clay. After all, the Bible says that God took clay and used it to form man. It’s something that is within our culture. The first thing you do as a child is get a piece of clay, squeeze it into your hand, add bits and pieces, then draw an eye or a mouth on to it. Clay automatically lends itself to making. It is embodied into the motion of making a body, a person.Ceramics are often described as “craft”. Do you think this is a helpful definition?For me, crafting work is a term that means you are making work, you are actually crafting a piece of work. There is nothing wrong in making craft I actually think it’s a very apt word for making, but it’s not helpful when it classifies certain work as not being of equal status to art. When you say you’re a craft person, people just assume that you don’t have the same attributes and the same ability as somebody who is an artist.Do you think the art world takes ceramics seriously?I think it’s beginning to do so. A lot of people from other mediums are now working in clay. This is not surprising, because of all making mediums, clay is the most versatile and pliable and naturally earthly, sympathetic and human. More than any other art, it has crossed the boundaries of disciplines in very interesting ways. You see people like Richard Deacon and Yayoi Kusama using clay. Tony Cragg has used clay for a long time, and his work is very object-oriented. There’s also Sterling Ruby.I can’t actually think of anyone who isn’t excited about clay. I mean, look at Grayson Perry. But I would suggest that if someone is interested in seeing ceramics, they should visit the art school degree shows around the country.• Magdalene Odundo: The Journey of Things is at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Norwich, until 15 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7566b10fded410006a15b9217d98c881fc1720ed/1580_323_3214_1928/master/3214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2aa78834e50453ca218a7b0d698ac5d6","title":"a belarusian womans life story in outfits in pictures","story":"Minsk-based photographer Tatsiana Tkachova was in Volozhin, Belarus in 2017 when she saw an elegant woman in a bright dress.

They speak to the dark politics of our timesBack in the benighted 20th century comic books were seen as subliterate trash for kiddies and intellectually challenged adults – badly written, hastily drawn and execrably printed. Martin Goodman, the founder and publisher of what is now known as Marvel Comics, once told Stan Lee that there was no point in trying to make the stories literate or worry about character development: “Just give them a lot of action and don’t use too many words.” It’s a genuine marvel that this formula led to works that were so resonant and vital.The comic book format can be credited to a printing salesman, Maxwell Gaines, looking for a way to keep newspaper supplement presses rolling in 1933 by reprinting collections of popular newspaper comic strips in a half-tabloid format. As an experiment, he slapped a 10 cents sticker on a handful of the free pamphlets and saw them quickly sell out at a local newsstand. Soon most of the famous funnies were being gathered into comic books by a handful of publishers – and new content was needed at cheap reprint rates. This new material was mostly made up of third-rate imitations of existing newspaper strips, or genre stories echoing adventure, detective, western or jungle pulps. As Marshall McLuhan once pointed out, every medium subsumes the content of the medium that precedes it before it finds its own voice.Enter Jerry Siegel, an aspiring teenage writer, and Joe Shuster, a young would-be artist – both nerdy alienated Jewish misfits many decades before that was remotely cool. They dreamed of the fame, riches and admiring glances from girls that a syndicated strip might bring, and developed their idea of a superhuman alien from a dying planet who would fight for truth, justice and the values of President Roosevelt’s New Deal. Barely out of childhood themselves, the boys’ idea was rejected by the newspaper syndicates as naive, juvenile and unskilled, before Gaines bought their 13 pages of Superman samples for Action Comics at 10 bucks a page – a fee that included all rights to the character. Not only was Siegel and Shuster’s creation the model for the brand new genre that came to define the medium, their lives were the tragic paradigm for creators bilked of the large rewards their creations brought their publishers.It is generally agreed that Superman launched the golden age of comics in June 1938 with his debut in Action Comics #1, published by what is now known as DC Comics. Siegel and Shuster had created a new archetype – or perhaps, more accurately, a new stereotype – and by 1940, once the nascent genre had demonstrated that it could get kids to part with millions of dimes per month, swarms of imitators catapulted hordes of four-colour heroes into the skies, all chasing the gold in this golden age. The juvenile naivety of Superman was, it seems, actually part of its allure, inviting youngsters into a new especially kid-friendly kind of story whose fantasies were even more unfettered by logic than most prose pulp fiction, all presented with diagrammatic visuals in primary and secondary colours that could make every page a theatre curtain to be raised on to new eyeball kicks and … action.Goodman, trend-surfing publisher of some lurid pulps, was one of the first to ride the superhero wave, immediately making a giant splash with his first issue of Marvel Comics in October 1939. (The first printing of 80,000 copies was followed by a reprint of 800,000 more.) The content was provided by Funnies, Inc, a comic book packager that could produce complete comics from concept to finished art for nascent publishers who wanted to keep their overheads low. These “shops” had something in common with the garment district sweatshops that many of the artists’ family members worked in. Usually done as piecework while punching a time clock with many hands (script-writers, pencillers, inkers and letterers) all attacking the original pages almost simultaneously, this was more a small industry than an art form.It recruited green youngsters, washed up old hacks and even – when the second world war came along and drafted many of the young men who filled the growing demand for comics – women, people of colour and other interlopers. (Those interlopers, by the way, still had to provide the racist and sexist stereotypes that have long been a touchstone of the whole medium.)At this point, it might be worth pointing out (not out of ethnic pride, but because it might shed some light on the rawness and the specific themes of the early comics) that the pioneers behind this embryonic medium based in New York were predominantly Jewish and from ethnic minority backgrounds. It wasn’t just Siegel and Shuster, but a whole generation of recent immigrants and their children – those most vulnerable to the ravages of the great depression – who were especially attuned to the rise of virulent antisemitism in Germany. They created the American Übermenschen who fought for a nation that would at least nominally welcome “your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free … ”To namecheck just a few of these secular Jews who had adopted Clark Kent-like secret identities: Gaines was born Max Ginzberg Goodman’s parents immigrated from Vilnius, Lithuania Jack Kirby (né Jacob Kurtzberg), the powerhouse who co-created Captain America with his landsman Joe Simon, was born in the slums of New York’s Lower East Side and Stan Lee, who became the face of Marvel Comics, was Goodman’s wife’s cousin, nepotistically hired as a 17‑year-old office boy named Stanley Lieber. Though not welcome in the higher precincts of advertising and publishing, they were all able to find their niche at the bottom of the barrel.The unseasoned artists in these comics factories discovered the possibilities of a new form while under do-or-die deadline pressures. They picked up their skills by copying each other and by stealing directly from the masters of the newspaper adventure comics: Alex Raymond (Flash Gordon, Secret Agent X-9), Hal Foster (Tarzan, Prince Valiant) and Milton Caniff (Terry and the Pirates). On the other hand, Carl Burgos (né Max Finkelstein), who created the lead feature in Marvel Comics #1, The Human Torch, proudly said: “If they wanted Raymond or Caniff they could look at Raymond or Caniff. The miserable drawing was all mine.” A writer-artist, his then rudimentary drawing skills were buttressed by an intuitive visual storytelling ability and were applied to an inspired character: The Human Torch. The character – an anthropomorphised streak of red and yellow flame – had a graphic intensity that burned its way into readers’ eyeballs and personified the raw crackling energy of the early comic books before they were domesticated.William Blake “Bill” Everett, Burgos’s comrade at Funnies, Inc, was an oddity in comics. For one thing, he wasn’t Jewish. Everett came from a 300-year-old patrician Massachusetts family and he really was a direct descendant of his namesake. He came to the outsider status that drew him to comics via an addictive personality – he was a heavy drinker from the age of 12 and had a three-pack-a-day cigarette habit – or maybe it was an outsider’s sensibility that drove him to drink. He was one of the most gifted artists ever to work in comic books. He drew fluidly, was comfortable in many genres, and had a sense of page design that allowed the reader’s eye to find buried visual treasures while swimming effortlessly through a story.His alienated antihero, Namor, the Sub-Mariner, was the forefather of a long line of troubled characters that would populate the Marvel universe a couple of decades later. In the 1940s the Sub-Mariner was singular – a marked contrast to the square and square-jawed vigilante do-gooders who lived in the less scruffy DC Comics neighbourhood. Never fully at home in the ocean or in the air, Namor was proud, arrogant and more volatile than the Human Torch, his complementary opposite. But water and fire combined to bring Marvel Comics to an elemental boil.In late 1940, over a year before Pearl Harbor, while the Nazis were Blitzkrieging London, Simon, an entrepreneurial freelancer for Funnies, Inc, was hired by Goodman to write, draw and edit for him directly. Simon showed him the cover concept for a new superhero that he and Kirby had dreamed up – a hero dressed like an American flag with giant biceps and abs of steel has just burst into Nazi headquarters and knocked Hitler over with a haymaker to the jaw. Goodman began to tremble, knowing what an impact this book would make and remained anxious until the first issue of Captain America, dated March 1941, landed on the stands. Goodman had been terrified that someone might assassinate Hitler before the comic book came out!Captain America was a recruiting poster, battling against the real Nazi super-villains while Superman was still fighting cheap gunsels, strike breakers, greedy landlords and Lex Luthor – and America was still equivocating about entering the conflict at all. No wonder Simon and Kirby’s comic book became an enormous hit, selling close to a million copies a month throughout the war. But not everyone was a fan in 1941 – according to Simon, the German American Bund and America Firsters bombarded the publisher’s offices with hate mail and obscene phone calls that screamed “Death to the Jews!” Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, a real-life superhero, called to reassure him, saying: “The city of New York will see that no harm comes to you.”Kirby’s hyperkinetic figures with hypertrophied muscles left human anatomy in the dust. His characters were bellicose, humourless, single-minded and angry as they burst out of saw-toothed panels and widescreen spreads. His art set the tone for superheroic action, not just during the war years, but ever since.I know that Kirby was a protean original as a comic book creator as well as a genuine war hero, but I confess that I have a blind spot when it comes to the superhero genre that grew out of the template he set. Even when I was 12, superheroes were my methadone – I was deeply addicted to satire magazines such as Mad, and the old newspaper comics I discovered in my public library’s bound volumes. I preferred more mature fare like Donald Duck and Little Lulu. You see, I love the form of comics – the pages full of co-mixed words and pictures butting up against each other, all those little boxes you have to compare and contrast to pry out the narrative juice and I adore the weird idiosyncrasies of cartoon language in all its accents. Those who find superheroes the alpha and omega of comics date the end of the golden age to some time in the postwar 1940s when interest in the genre faded.Disenchanted GIs, no longer an eager and captive audience, may have realised that it wasn’t Captain America who won the war. Maybe it was the Russians! In any case, demobilised soldiers either grew out of the comic book habit or shifted their attention to other genres. Crime, cowboy, romance, horror and war-themed comics flourished, often with more mature – and even lurid – content designed for older readers.I date the end of the golden age to 1954. A moral panic built on the false assumption that the medium was strictly for young kids and was turning them into juvenile delinquents had led to comic-book burnings and to US Senate hearings that ultimately put many publishers out of business and maimed the rest. Sanitised superheroes brought the medium off life support in 1956 (now hailed as the beginning of the silver age) but the medium never regained the ubiquity it had in its heyday – as comic books. As movies, they have conquered the world!Back in the golden age, if you wanted to see some guy in a cape fly over a skyscraper or turn New York City into rubble, comic book panels were the most satisfying delivery system. In the 21st century, thanks to the miracle of CGI, many millions of people around the globe who have never read a comic or heard of graphic novels go to their multiplexes to worship the new deities that embody the DNA of comics.The young Jewish creators of the first superheroes conjured up mythic – almost god-like – secular saviours to deal with the threatening economic dislocations that surrounded them in the great depression and gave shape to their premonitions of impending global war. Comics allowed readers to escape into fantasy by projecting themselves on to invulnerable heroes.Auschwitz and Hiroshima make more sense as dark comic book cataclysms than as events in our real world. In today’s all too real world, Captain America’s most nefarious villain, the Red Skull, is alive on screen and an Orange Skull haunts America. International fascism again looms large (how quickly we humans forget – study these golden age comics hard, boys and girls!) and the dislocations that have followed the global economic meltdown of 2008 helped bring us to a point where the planet itself seems likely to melt down. Armageddon seems somehow plausible and we’re all turned into helpless children scared of forces grander than we can imagine, looking for respite and answers in superheroes flying across screens in our chapel of dreams.While the content of comic books has hijacked our cinema, the form of comics – cleverly disguised as graphic novels – has infiltrated what’s left of our literary culture. When the Folio Society, venerable publisher of luxurious illustrated books since 1947, decided to plunge in with a deluxe compilation of golden age Marvel comics, they invited me, as a graphic novelist and comic book scholar, to write an introduction to the book. Perhaps they misguidedly figured that I might lend the endeavour a fig leaf of respectability.I turned the essay in at the end of June, substantially the same as what appears here. A regretful Folio Society editor told me that Marvel Comics (evidently the co-publisher of the book) is trying to now stay “apolitical”, and is not allowing its publications to take a political stance. I was asked to alter or remove the sentence that refers to the Red Skull or the intro could not be published. I didn’t think of myself as especially political compared with some of my fellow travellers, but when asked to kill a relatively anodyne reference to an Orange Skull I realised that perhaps it had been irresponsible to be playful about the dire existential threat we now live with, and I withdrew my introduction.A revealing story serendipitously showed up in my news feed this week. I learned that the billionaire chairman and former CEO of Marvel Entertainment, Isaac “Ike” Perlmutter, is a longtime friend of Donald Trump’s, an unofficial and influential adviser and a member of the president’s elite Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. And Perlmutter and his wife have each recently donated $360,000 (the maximum allowed) to the Orange Skull’s “Trump Victory Joint Fundraising Committee” for 2020. I’ve also had to learn, yet again, that everything is political... just like Captain America socking Hitler on the jaw."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36b6dd79275a5713b932a3ac10d74626d7df5c1d/0_286_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4df39547e62336afcf2c396be6428fda","title":"book clinic what can i read to look cultured when i go to cambridge","story":"Q: What books should I read before I start university?

Her 2010 novel, Whatever You Love, was shortlisted for the Costa novel award and the Orange prize, while her bestselling novel Apple Tree Yard was adapted by the BBC into a four-part drama starring Emily Watson and Ben Chaplin. Her most recent novel, Platform Seven, tackles suicide, coercive control and life after death.Platform Seven features a dead protagonist. Why did you want to tell a story from the perspective of someone who has died?I grew up in a small town in the East Midlands, so going back home to see my parents has always involved changing trains at Peterborough. It can be a really bleak station on a cold winter’s night, and I used to have a joke that when I die and go to purgatory, I’ll find myself trapped on Peterborough station. So I decided to have a novel with the ghost of a woman who was trapped there: it’s a transitional place. She’s a lost soul.What were the challenges in having a dead protagonist?I was really intrigued by the technical challenge. For a start, you have to work out what your ghost can do. Can my ghost pass through walls? Are they a poltergeist? I decided early on that I wanted her to be able to read people’s minds because as well as her story, I wanted the novel to be an ensemble piece: she is also the omniscient narrator of other people’s lives.One of the central themes in the book is coercive control. What made you want to write about that?I was interested in writing about a relationship where there was no physical abuse but a huge amount of manipulation and psychological abuse, and how that could be just as potent and deadly. And trying to convey the ways in which very ordinary men, who people think of as good blokes, can be abusive in ways that are so subtle and all-pervasive that even the recipient mistrusts her own perceptions of it.What research did you do?I think everybody has been in or come close to a relationship like that, and if you’re lucky you get out early not because you necessarily fully understand what’s going on, you just know something doesn’t feel right. I think that by-and-large women are still raised to mistrust their own instincts if a man presents as eligible.Coercive control was criminalised in 2015, and yet by the end of 2018 the vast majority of cases had been dropped without charge. Why do you think that is?Women who’ve been subjected to it for many years might not seem reliable: they don’t trust themselves, their stories may be inconsistent, they may have mental health problems, which after decades of coercive control is almost inevitable. It’s the same for a lot of crimes against women: the focus is still on the behaviour of the victim. There’s got to be a seismic shift.When did your love of writing begin?Very early on. I was often accused of having an overactive imagination as a child and I was an avid reader. I used to fib to my mum, saying I was going out to play with the other kids and actually having a book in my pocket. I’d built a den on the waste ground at the far end of the housing estate where I grew up and I would hide there and read. I wrote a novel when I was 11 I even cut out cardboard covers because I wanted it to be a hardback. And I spent a lot of time in the local library. It made me into a writer.So you didn’t grow up in a bookish household?Not at all. My dad left school when he was 13, my mum when she was 15 or 16, and my brother and sister and I were the first generation to go to university. My parents were from very working-class backgrounds but my father did have a real bee in his bonnet about education and self-improvement .What were your favourite books as a child?I was into fantasy and science fiction. I loved the Ursula K Le Guin Wizard of Earthsea books. Fantasy at that age is about pure imagination, and what those books showed me is that the whole world is at your fingertips if you write. And before that, the Narnia books: I remember spending a fair amount of time in wardrobes hoping to get through and see a talking fawn.Which writers have most influenced your own writing?In terms of contemporary fiction, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje and Toni Morrison. Also 19th-century writers: the Brontë sisters in particular, and Dickens. The idea of the big, fat complicated story is what’s influenced me most.Which genres do you most enjoy?Story-driven literary fiction: a really good writer telling a really good story.Are there any you avoid?I can’t bear any sort of romantic fiction: anything soppy or chicklitty or girly. It brings me out in hives. I’m not saying I don’t write about romance or relationships. But I want those people to have complex lives. It really annoys me in a book if people don’t have jobs or never worry about the gas bill.Is there a book or author you always return to?I would read anything by the Norwegian journalist Åsne Seierstad – she wrote The Bookseller of Kabul and One of Us, about the Anders Breivik killings. She’s a really good long-form journalist. And Janet Malcolm – I’m a big fan of hers.Which literary figures – dead or alive – would you most like to meet?The Brontës, but they can leave Branwell at home. I’d like to tell Emily that even though Wuthering Heights got really bad reviews and was compared very unfavourably with Jane Eyre, now people consider it superior. And I’d like to beg her not to destroy her second novel.What books are on your bedside table to read next?Top of the list is Rife: Twenty-One Stories from Britain’s Youth, which is an anthology edited by Nikesh Shukla and Sammy Jones. Also Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other. I’m reading Elif Sharak’s 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in this Strange World at the moment and loving it. And Will Storr’s The Science of Storytelling because I’m interested in how the human brain invents and consumes narrative.• Platform Seven by Louise Doughty is published by Faber (£14.99).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s start with a beautiful example of nominative determinism. Isabella Tree’s Wilding has affected Wellfitbooty “more than any book I’ve read in many years”:It’s the story of a large farm in Sussex, England, which chose about 20 years ago to stop intensive farming and allow its lands to return to nature. It is now home to many threatened species, including the turtle dove and emperor butterfly is home to all 5 species of British owl, 11 species of bats – and countless other insects and birds.The author is one of the owners and the style is very readable and engaging – in fact I couldn’t put it down. The principles in the book can be applied to gardens of any size … I wholeheartedly recommend it.The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 and ¾ by Sue Townsend still works for writeronthestorm:Taking me back to my childhood when I borrowed this off my older brother and thought it was hilarious… It still stands up as a funny and enjoyable read. I’ve got the next couple of books in the series and will move onto them at some point.For the 15th time I think. I call it my summer book. It never fails to delight me.Mission To Tashkent by Frederick Marshman Bailey has impressed SchwarzwaldBummel:An incredible true-story romp about an English spy hired by Lenin’s Cheka to capture himself. Bailey a national treasure who deserves more recognition.“Thank you to everyone on here who recommended Elizabeth Taylor,” says Rick2016. “Without Tips, Links and Suggestions I’d never have discovered Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, which proved wonderful”:It’s a quiet, understated book, but every line is so well crafted and has such power. The lessons it teaches are, when you write them down, obvious. Everyone needs love, physical contact, to feel wanted and like their company is a pleasure, not a burden. And yet it’s so easy to forget that everybody else feels these things in the cavalcade and clamour of everyday life.. Elizabeth Taylor’s empathy, compassion and ability to portray the irreducible human core of her characters are utterly remarkable and I thoroughly recommend Mrs Palfrey ... to anyone who hasn’t read it.More good work by you guys: FrogC has started reading When Mystical Creatures Attack by Kathleen Founds, “following a tip from a reader of this column”:It’s a series of linked short stories about a high-school class in Texas, most of them troubled, and their teacher who is equally so, being confined in a sort of capitalist asylum where they give Wellness Points(TM) for fulfilling various therapeutic tasks. The construction is ingenious - you might say gimmicky, but I like that kind of thing: the title story, for example, consists of the essays written by the students on how their favourite mythical creature might solve some world problem (though a lot of the problems chosen, inevitably, are on a more personal scale). Funny and moving. I love the fact that the most feared teacher is referred to simply as “The Sir”.Alexia_R has been pleased to pick up The Runaways by Fatima Bhutto:I picked this up on a whim in Foyles because it was a beautiful, signed copy. It’s a fast-paced story of three Pakistani young people (one of them British-Pakistani), negotiating their culture, religion etc. One of them is gay and struggling to accept it, another is from a very privileged background, another is from a slum of Karachi. I can’t say too much about the plot without giving it away. I was absolutely loving this and was about to praise it to the skies but I wasn’t too sure about the ending. Still, very good.RedmonT has almost finished Purity by Jonathan Franzen:Not quite as good as The Corrections and Freedom, but then that might only be because of how the account of Tom and Annabel’s relationship makes me feel. It’s awful – the feeling of dread I felt throughout that section, the nerves, the butterflies, the absurd behaviour. It’s been a long time since a book made me feel that way.He is amazing at threading stories together. It doesn’t even matter that it’s occasionally haphazard - realising things in a non-linear order affects the way you realise them (and changes what you thought you knew). There have been two or three moments that made me sit up and exclaim “FUCK” or “OH MY GOD”.I think he does something inwith his books that no other living writer does.Catch-22 attracts all the plaudits but this is well worth checking out as a study of the office environment and the feeling of ‘Is this all there is?’ It’s as sharp as TV’s Mad Men, which I suspect was influenced by it. I read about one third of the book in a single evening until the early hours. It’s that good.It is that good.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

When I tell people that I am spending my break swimming in the North Sea off Yorkshire, reactions tend to run from “you’re brave” to “why would you do that?”. Which I imagine is similar to the comments I’d get if I announced I was taking a week to visit prisoners with whole-life orders. But I maintain that true pleasure requires not much more than an RNLI-supervised beach, a tide table and a novel to read between dips.The British seaside is tragically underappreciated and disastrously underfunded. A lack of year-round jobs and lousy transport links are driving its residents away: four in 10 coastal towns are forecast to suffer a decline in their population of under-30s, with those in the north worst affected. Even the south-west, which attracts nearly half of the visitors to Britain’s coast, is struggling. Places that are a hive of cute tearooms and sun-dappled tourists in the summer pull down their shutters at the end of the season the holidaymakers leave and a bleak and empty winter sets in.From the late 19th century to the mid-20th, though, Britain’s coastal towns formed a halo of small paradises around the edge of the island, initially driven by the craze for spa towns. This history is visible in once magnificent, now often derelict, architecture, such as the painfully neglected Birnbeck pier at Weston-super-Mare. In Scarborough, the Grand Hotel overlooks the South Bay in Victorian splendour formerly a refuge for the wealthiest tourists, it was dogged by food poisoning scares in the 2000s and you can now stay for less than it costs to put up in the nearby Travelodge.Railway ads from the 1920s and 30s show the leisure and luxury that a trip to the seaside promised. Come to Blackpool and find a glamorous redhead reading on the yellow sand, back enticingly bare in a halterneck costume, the illuminations of the tower glinting overhead. Filey in North Yorkshire is painted as an art deco paradise, enjoyed by a beatific trio of mother, father and toddler in elegant bathing suits. (There’s a less salubrious seaside than the train companies chose to show, as well: fresh air in your lungs, money in your pocket and strangers on the esplanade could give a person ideas.)But in the 1950s, postwar prosperity combined with the growth of civil aviation to suck tourism away from Britain’s coast and now place names such as Skegness and Minehead have a distinctly bathetic sound. My childhood didn’t involve many trips to the seaside and those I remember didn’t involve going in the sea much. In Robin Hood’s Bay in Yorkshire, I bothered the inhabitants of rock pools, but I never went deeper than my shins. This was understandable, given that in the 1980s a lot of Britain’s beaches were disgusting and my parents probably didn’t care to turn their toddlers loose in a soup of litter and sewage.It also deserves to be more than a period piece, although part of the seaside’s joy is definitely nostalgia. Sitting at a chrome and Formica table in Scarborough’s Harbour Bar, ordering ice-cream sundaes with names such as peach Melba and pear Valentino (after Dame Nellie and, presumably, Rudolph) will put a person in a pleasantly old-fashioned state of mind. And when you are cold all the way through your internal organs from 10 minutes in the waves, it’s a scalding builder’s tea you want and not a flat white.The reason we should be investing in, and protecting, the beauties of Britain’s seaside isn’t so we can live in an imaginary version of the past, though. The number of saltwater lidos and wrought-iron piers lost to vandalism and council indolence is sickening: we should be saving those things so we can go on using them. The gorgeous art deco Jubilee Pool in Penzance underwent seemingly catastrophic damage in 2014, but was rescued by the community and shows how even the most dilapidated bits of our coastal heritage can be revived.Part of the reason that seaside structures are so vulnerable to carelessness is, of course, that the sea is a wild place: maintaining anything is a constant battle against lashing winds and erosion. (Maybe the proximity to wildness is what made coastal resorts such as Brighton destinations for sexual freedom.) One of the thrills of going back to the same cliffs again and again is seeing the rocks reshape with each visit. The impossibility of developing fragile coastal land is a salvation for wildlife – a few steps from the road, you’ll find the air busy with insect life, and swallows feasting on the wing.I’m keeping my favourite beach to myself – I’m not sure I want to share it with golden-age numbers of tourists – but there’s plenty of room on Britain’s coast for more visitors. Take yourself to the seaside, e all the way in, fill up on chips and ice cream and don’t forget about the coast when summer is over.• Sarah Ditum is a writer on politics and culture"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aec428b7a41c8b41e42184d60f041d0bc540cd7/0_150_4818_2891/master/4818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f19865231370636c9207ca7f7b5bb67","title":"last wek i gazed on truly wild land and saw art reflected back","story":"Humans created their societies in defiance of nature, but it still has the power to instil aweAchmore is a nondescript hamlet on the A858 that cuts across the isle of Lewis and Harris in the Outer Hebrides. This is a gnarled, fractured landscape, swaddled in wind and rain, and built out of some of the oldest rocks on Earth – Lewisian gneiss, the bedrock of the island, is some 3bn years old, two-thirds the age of Earth itself.We had gone to Achmore to search out an ancient stone circle. There are dozens of these, including the most famous one at Calanais, scattered across Lewis’s melancholic moorland. The Achmore stone circle was disappointing, with little to catch the eye. But then we turned to look south. And almost gasped. For Lewis’s forbidding landscape, caught in a delicate light suffused through the late-afternoon cloud, had been transformed, becoming draped in an ethereal, almost unreal, beauty. Dozens of lochans – small lochs – dappled the foreground. Behind them, where the hills of Harris rose, were layer upon soft layer of pastel colours, from gold through green to blue, laid like chiffon scarves across the horizon.I love bleakness. Not as a human condition but as a physical landscape. Not for me the well-tended orchards of Kent or the Constable-painted loveliness of the Stour valley. Give me, rather, the menace of Dartmoor, the strangeness of Orford Ness on the Suffolk coast, the emptiness of Ranoch Moor in the Scottish Highlands and most of all the dark, brooding allure of the Western Isles of the Outer Hebrides and the Northern Isles of Orkney and the Shetlands. These are all places that can be desolate, even hostile. Yet they are also landscapes imbued with beauty, even grace, such as that moorland in Lewis.As a human condition, bleakness suggests that one is in a place empty of joy or hope. Much of the landscape that we call bleak is bleak in a different way – because it isn’t manicured or domesticated. There is a wildness about it by which we can be discomfited and yet often also celebrate and romanticise.In his book The Wild Places, Robert Macfarlane, one of the most expressive nature writers of our time, observes that throughout history there have been two broad responses to wildness. On the one hand, it is perceived as “a dangerous force that confounds the order-bringing pursuits of human culture and agriculture”. On the other is a perception of wildness “as an energy both exemplary and exquisite, and of wild places as realms of miracle, ersity and abundance”. Wildness as a threat and wildness as a refuge.Neither perspective, though, captures humanity’s complex, entangled relationship with the wild. Human societies have in large part been carved out in defiance of nature. From the houses we build to shelter us from the elements to the medicines we develop to protect us from pathogens, from the piped water without which millions still die from diarrhoea and other illnesses, to the weather stations that provide warnings of hurricanes and heat waves, we are constantly in a struggle to shield ourselves from nature’s furies. There is a rational root to the fear of the wild and of the threat that it can pose.At the same time, the eulogisation of nature, and a yearning for a wilderness that has been lost or despoiled, is inextricably human. There are many threads to such a yen. For some, the depredations caused by human activity, from river pollution to global warming, outweigh the benefits. Along with human development has developed a disdain of progress and civilisation. For others, modernity and urbanisation have brought with them a spiritual loss, a severing of our elemental ties with nature.Whatever the roots, wildness does not simply lie “out there”, but inside, in the human imagination. We project upon the wild the fears and hopes, the emotions and passions, nurtured by history and culture and community. It is through culture and imagination that we imbue the wild with meaning.The beauty of the Western Isles and the Northern Isles is remarkable, their wildness and bleakness something to be treasured. But when I look upon them, what I see is coloured by far more than the landscape itself. It is a landscape created in the novels of George Mackay Brown, the poetry of Kevin MacNeil, the paintings of Wendy Sutherland, the photography of Rebecca Marr, the writings of Macfarlane. That, too, is remarkable and something to be treasured."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f157858b9fafc04ac330707e2171aafc75444d41/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=305251b485312d5e09678e5900e34713","title":"the philadelphia story couldnt be told today","story":"Advertising has come a long way since the days of ditzy girls, but not far enough for its watchdogMany years ago, a friend’s mother asked her if her husband was going to accompany them to the playground. “No, Mum,” my pal replied, with what the cynical might assume was false brightness. “He’s seen the kids go down a slide before.”Now, in these times when, as enraged libertarians like to point out, one can hardly crack a common-or-garden joke without being sent to the stocks, she’d probably be fined for perpetuating a negative gender stereotype.Well: only if she were making an ad and sticking it on primetime TV. Last week, under new rules that empower the Advertising Standards Authority to regulate depictions of men and women in ways that can “play a part in limiting people’s potential”, came the first news of infringements. The offenders? Some cream cheese and an electric car.In the first, a pair of new dads, who do not appear to know one another, become so beguiled by a Philadelphia-slathered bagel that they accidentally abandon their infants to a food-delivery conveyor belt of the type you might see in London’s hipsterish Hoxton. The ad poses many questions: why are these men so excited by the kind of al-desko lunch produced by a quick rootle round the fridge? Why have they, in contravention of all the laws of British social life, struck up a conversation? Given the slowness and generous width of the conveyor belt, how much danger are these children actually in?No matter: our hapless cafe-goers are prime examples of the damaging notion that men are ineffectual care-givers. Out they go!Volkswagen’s advertisement for its eGolf car is perhaps even more bemusing. A male and female couple camp on the side of a cliff, though the woman is only briefly glimpsed, dozing. Cut to some astronauts, and then to a male para-athlete doing the long jump and, finally, to a woman sitting on a bench, beside a pram. A car, presumably an eGolf, glides by, causing the woman to look up, perhaps wistfully. Who is in the car? Could it be a camper, an astronaut and an athlete, off to meet their babysitting chums in the bagel cafe? Who knows: you carry on sitting on a roadside with your kid, Barbara-no-mates. Perhaps the lady camper will come and help you change its nappy.Both ads are baffling, but are they harmful? Common sense tells us the answer: in isolation, unlikely as a cog in the machine of advanced capitalism and entrenched gender power structures, quite possibly.But why stop at gender? We don’t appear to be bothered that the protagonists of these ads are white and look fairly well off – as of course they need to be, to afford fancy lunches and new cars. After all, we know how to reach black people: you simply paste your message on the inside of a fried chicken box. The poor? A bogof deal or a payday loan. God did not give us seven seasons of Mad Men in order for us not to understand that stereotyping is hardwired into the DNA of advertising. Its effects are pernicious, even if women do not actually believe that they bleed blue liquid once a month, nor men that they will turn into Gerard Butler, aka “the man of today”, if they splash on a bit of Hugo Boss. That we believe these things on a literal basis is not important that we reach for our wallets, trusting that we might make a marginal improvement to our lives with each new purchase, is central. And if you’re going to overhaul the world of selling to the psyche, I would humbly suggest that cream cheese is not the place to start.Anyway, a thought for Philadelphia, which back in the 1980s enjoyed great success with a pair of young women, played by Sara Crowe and Ann Bryson, whose lunchboxes were transformed by the product. Ditzy, verging on vacuous, unposh, irrepressibly cheerful, they’d be unlikely to get past the censors. But in these troubled times, it’s worth a go.• Alex Clark writes for the  and the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df178c09a8d7005c6143cde1994f088dbfae423/310_0_2538_1524/master/2538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=673c2d485d6ea2779aedde7ed62837f3","title":"english a level tell us whats driving the drop in take up of the subject","story":"We want to hear from students and teachers why English is declining as a choice for A-level pupilsOnce a popular subject choice for sixth formers, schools are now seeing a sharp drop in the take-up of English literature and language at A-level.Some blame the recently reformed English GCSEs for “sucking the joy” out of the subject, while others suggest the push for vocational secondary education is stopping people from choosing it.We want to hear from students, educators, parentss about why you think fewer people are studying English at A-level.

It may even see an extinct animal, the woolly mammoth, get safeguards, on the grounds that illegal elephant ivory is sometimes laundered by being labelled as antique mammoth tusks.Ivonne Higuero, the secretary general of Cites, said: “Cites is a powerful tool for ensuring sustainability and responding to the rapid loss of bioersity – often called the sixth mass extinction – by preventing and reversing declines in wildlife populations.”“We do depend on bioersity,” Higuero said. “It is not just an environmental issue. There are so many species that, if they went extinct, would be sorely missed and we just don’t realise it.”Matt Collis, the head of the NGO IFAW’s delegation at Cites, said: “Illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade, coupled with habitat loss and other human-made threats, has decimated many species so that they are now at a tipping point for future survival. It is vital that countries come together to do all they can.”The Cites agreement regulates the international trade in wildlife, from live animals to skins and timber, and unlike other international conventions can punish countries that flout bans by barring them from lucrative markets.In the run-up to the meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, conservationists have called for sanctions against Mexico, home to the vaquita, a porpoise on the edge of extinction with only about 19 left alive. The vaquita’s demise also illustrates the deadly role of criminals in the destruction of wildlife. The illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be worth $7bn to $23bn a year, ranking only behind drugs, human trafficking and weapons.“The vaquita is really a poster child for what is happening in terms of international criminal networks and wildlife,” said Higuero. “They use wildlife like drugs, prostitution and arms, because the financial rewards are high.”The vaquita is killed as bycatch when fishers target the totoaba, a large fish whose swim bladder can sell illegally for $20,000 a kilogram in China because of its supposed medicinal properties.She said the area of sea involved was just a quarter of the size of Los Angeles: “If we can’t protect this, what hope is there for anything else?”Vietnam will also come under pressure, after independent analyses found it was the largest destination for illegal elephant ivory and rhino horn. Margaret Kinnaird, head of global wildlife at the WWF, said: “Vietnam has been of great concern for many years now – much more has to be done.”Another flashpoint will be opposing proposals on elephants, of which about 20,000 are poached every year for the illegal ivory trade. Southern African countries, home to large populations, want to loosen restrictions to raise funds for conservation. But others on the continent want to make the ivory ban even broader.The most unusual proposal at the summit is to put an extinct species – the woolly mammoth – on the list of species for which trade is restricted. “It would absolutely be the first time,” Higuero said. “The fear is that elephant ivory is being traded as if it were mammoth ivory.”The summit may also bring good news, with some species being taken off danger lists because their populations are recovering. One, the vicuña, is a relative of the llama and provides extremely valuable wool. Higuero said the prospects of the animal had been improved by getting local communities involved in their conservation. “This is definitely a demonstration of how successful you can be when there are issues of humans and wildlife living side by side,” she added.A quartet of Australian rodents may also be struck off the list of species in which all trade is banned, for the simple reason that no one wants to buy the greater stick nest rat, the false swamp rat, the central rock rat and the Shark Bay mouse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aefa6bfef9269fe484a5bf174b76950214b2f427/282_244_4711_2826/master/4711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57fba06cfedba6cce32777aec90e4b3a","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Endangered bonobo, migrating storks and one of the world’s biggest raptors"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea09f0162570b711fd7fd7f9932af27eca81ca48/0_112_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40c6c280fe733af6152575454786b009","title":"tell us how have you reused your wedding dress","story":"We want to hear if you opted for a non-traditional dress, or if you’ve repurposed it so you could wear it againWorn for the big day, gone tomorrow – for many people a wedding dress will be the single most expensive item of clothing they ever buy.

Weirdly, this sprightly, self-aware action-adventure movie does. Director James Bobin and co-writer Nicholas Stoller launch with the cartoon’s memorably bouncy theme tune. Within minutes, a six-year-old Dora (Madelyn Miranda) is breaking the fourth wall and asking the audience if they can say “delicioso” (in the original TV show, Dora would teach viewers Spanish words and phrases). Dora’s simian compadre Boots is computer-animated and integrated into the film’s ever-so-slightly surreal live-action world without question.Dora has grown up in the rainforests of Peru, home-schooled by her parents (a zoologist and an archeologist, played by Eva Longoria and Michael Peña respectively). They are explorers, the film insists, not treasure hunters, in one of its gentle swipes at colonialism. Now 16 years old, Dora (Isabela Moner) is being sent to the city, aka Los Angeles, to attend high school with her cousin Diego (Jeff Wahlberg) while her parents search for Parapata, the lost Incan city of gold. A relentlessly cheery brainiac with a propensity to burst into song, she soon earns the nickname Dorka, turning up to a themed school dance dressed as her “favourite star” – the sun. Moner is a magnetic, sunny screen presence. Seeing Dora navigate the wilds of high school would’ve been entertaining enough, but a kidnapping places her and her classmates back in the jungle.In this section of the film, there are Jungle Run-style mazes and puzzles, a farting bog of quicksand and a song about poo. A field of giant pink flowers precedes a trippy, animated interlude. Benicio del Toro voices a masked trickster fox. The result is goofily charming and a rare, age-appropriate children’s film in which the adults are silly and the kids, especially the girls, are smart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac591bd0d32ee607948cc5731deb752de0c77e5/213_0_2456_1474/master/2456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63c333957b22ebacf1d08c3b2f09814e","title":"peter fonda a life in pictures","story":"The actor best remembered for Easy Rider has died at the age of 79.

I had one just a few minutes ago. Kippers or smoked haddock are a nice treat. I have quite a thing about having a fish on its own on the plate.Dad died in a car accident when I was six. I’ve since discovered that in situations like that, one of the children – often the youngest, like me – will take on the role of “hero child”. Not out of any grand gesture necessarily, it just tends to happen. I’d peel spuds, top and tail gooseberries, dish out tripe and generally be Mum’s kitchen helper. She often said: “If you can’t cook eggs, Robert, you can’t be a chef.” My scrambled, especially, are very good.I used to like getting cups and putting tiny bits of food and liquids in them. I’d grow mould plumes in the dark wardrobe of my little back bedroom. Not to eat them, mind – just to admire the growing power.Mum was a cook for most of her life. During the war, she’d been with the Ministry of Food, going around the country showing people how to best use egg powder. That frugality lasted – I remember as a kid, when we visited the butcher she’d often ask for lots of “bacon bones”.In the 1950s, my mum ran hotels with my dad – him doing admin, her the food. I’ve sat outside a few pubs they ran, like the Bell Inn in Epping, and wondered about them working together. After Dad died, Mum was teaching cookery at a secondary school. She’d cook all day, so didn’t really want to cook again for four boys when she returned home knackered.I once accidentally set fire, with a sparkler, to a box of fireworks and threw them from the living room into Mum’s kitchen. They scorched the Formica and the lino, so I got down on my hands and knees, crying, and cleaned the marks with a Brillo pad, then half an hour later walked back into the living room, which was ablaze. You’d think you’d get a right rollicking from Mum for burning the house down, but it was too desperate a situation and her priority was not to shout at me at all.When I went fishing with mates as a kid I’d usually have strawberry jam or banana sandwiches on Mother’s Pride with sugar sprinkled all over. At one point I was putting 17 sugars in my tea. I know it’s unbelievable and I do wonder sometimes what my mum was thinking to allow it. The weirdest thing was that if I had 18 teaspoons it was too sweet. I suppose if I was trying to analyse it, losing my dad was more upsetting than I would have realised, yet I got quite a kick out of sugar.We tend to head down to Hampshire to fish. I’ll set off with no food at all, but on the way down I’ll pick up my pocket meats – scotch egg, sausage roll – and a lump of cheese. All the things I’m not meant to eat in my pocket to nibble during the day. Nic Roeg said, “You can get away, but you can’t get away from yourself”, but I can look at my watch, expecting half an hour has passed and realise it’s been hours and I certainly think in those hours I’ve got away from myself.I launched Cadbury’s Boost bar. For years and years my mum had asked, “When are you going to go back to your job as a solicitor?” But once she saw me in Boost commercials she realised I could make a living outside law. They were expensive ads filmed in the south of Spain with loads of cowboys and a big catering budget. It was lobsters in tents in the middle of a desert brought to me with sparkling wine.I can’t remember ever cooking food to impress a woman. The idea’s quite cheesy and sort of makes my skin crawl. But I sometimes make a special effort to impress my cats, with chicken liver or something. It’s tricky to know if a cat’s impressed. They might give me a little look, a glimpse at least. That’s cat ownership for you.There’s lots of food in the new series of Big Night Out. We have a hotdog sausage, its appearance activated by buzzer, which we use as a full stop in medical arguments between doctors. We’ve often used slices of white bread as facial disguise, with holes for our eyes. It’s benign, because no one wearing bread means you terrible harm. We look for items, often food, which have a benign feeling. Corned beef, for instance, seems very useful for what we do. In the last series we ate a whole can while sexy music played.I got married at a registry office, at 9 o’clock in the morning, and was crying during the ceremony. I had to be at hospital at 10.30 for my heart op, so we had time to go for a great big cafe fry-up, meant to be my last, although it hasn’t been, if truth be known. When I arrived at the hospital the nurses presented me with a big chocolate cake as a wedding present. I thought it a little odd on a heart ward, but my old pipes were about to go, so there was no point being kind to them.I always put prunes in my salads. Or pears, water chestnuts, celery. Those sorts of stringy foods. I’m not trying to be scientific, but I’ve been told by the experts who look after me that the body uses bad cholesterol to digest that stuff. Then you shoot out your bad cholesterol, basically. Happy days.In my kitchen is an old-fashioned sweet jar with a cow’s heart in it with an arrow through it. It was given to me as a gift after my operation. The blood red of a heart and the chrome silver of the arrow are a useful reminder of the damage you could do to your heart in a kitchen.FoodBecause of heart disease I should avoid steak and kidney pie and stilton cheese, which is about number three in cheeses with the highest amount of fat.

Don’t judge meI’m about to go holiday, and though the prospect is delightful, one thing is worrying me: the coffee situation. For the last few years, a group of us have rented a big, old house somewhere in deepest France. It’s a place I love as much as anywhere I’ve ever stayed: you will know what I mean when I say that it’s the kind of house where you want only to read Colette, and eat apricots, and lie in the bath with a large glass of rosé while listening to Francoise Hardy (you might want to pretend that you are Francoise Hardy, I couldn’t possibly comment). However, there is a problem, and that is the aforementioned coffee situation.The house has an old-fashioned percolator, but only one. There are no cafetieres, no stove-top devices, and no Nespresso machine. (I can no more imagine a Nespresso machine on its ancient kitchen counters than I can a go-go dancer.) But we are 10, at least. How to make sure there is enough coffee for everyone? In the past, we have used the percolator to fill a huge teapot with Costa Rican, after which we then immediately run it again for a second round.This, however, is both unsatisfactory, and un-chic. Should I pack my own cafetiere this year? I have considered this. But we’re travelling easyJet, and I think I would rather use my baggage allowance for another pair of sandals than a coffee pot. (Earlier today, I experimented, and tried to put a pair of sandals inside a cafetiere - alas, only one shoe would fit.)Thinking about this leads me to consider the problem of coffee-making generally. The perfect cup of coffee is like the perfect lipstick: a quest that will end only with your death. I disapprove of Nespresso machines and their ilk, and I don’t particularly like the coffee they make either. Cafetieres are so messy and gritty, and I never seem to get the coffee-to-water ratio quite right also, the coffee gets cold so quickly. I love my blackened stove-top Bialetti for reasons to do with nostalgia and all-round stylishness, but it makes pretty mud-like coffee: good for days when you’re knackered, but very bad indeed when the last thing you need is to be wired like Frankenstein. The huge, orange Italian espresso machine that I bought at vast expense some years ago looks fantastic. But working it is such a performance, and the coffee it makes always tastes of its metallic bowels to me.I think the best method at home is the most simple. Drip, drip, drip: like a percolator, only without the stewing effect of the hotplate. I have a china filter and I line it with a (recycled) paper filter, and that’s my morning cup – just as my dad used to make his in 1976. (His beans, incidentally, were roasted by Pollards of Sheffield, a business, established in 1879, that is still going strong and which now has a website, should you, too, be an exile.)This is no good for large numbers – unless, of course, you set out 10 cups and 10 filters – but the coffee it makes is at once rich and gentle, and the grounds are so easily dealt with. It takes a little while, but this is a good thing: as you wait, you can stare out of the window, pause for a moment before you begin your day. In these anxious times, such kitchen rituals are nothing short of a life raft.Of course, I’m not the only dripper around. Our numbers are growing exponentially, this being, I gather, the hipster’s method of choice. But in the 21st century, nothing is allowed to be simple for long – or at any rate, a thing’s simplicity must always be augmented made more refined. A company called Kinto makes what it calls a brewer stand set. It comprises a wooden base, a brass pole at the top of which is a brass filter, and a glass jug that holds four cups of coffee. Naturally, it is made in Japan. It costs – wait for it – £180. Yet even as I laugh at this, a feeling comes over me that is all too familiar. I might as well be at an Apple counter, about to buy yet another shade of matt rose. This bit of kit could be life changing … couldn’t it? Answers on an old bag of Ethiopian mocha Djimmah, please.

But now you’re staring down at a bag of short-grain brown rice, not basmati, and the game has changed: from soaking, to salting, to cooking.Rice is an ingredient with multiple personality types: just when you think you’ve figured it out, you’re met with another variety, another size, shape or colour. Not to mention its purpose: as the main event, a textural addition, a binding agent or to bulk out a meal.Don’t let this discourage you. With a little bit of patience (and perhaps a few shortcuts), you’ll find that there is more than a grain of truth to how versatile (and straightforward) rice really is.This vegan platter is great served at room temperature, so you can get ahead and prepare the rice, roasted vegetables and dressing up to a few hours in advance, assembling everything to serve.Prep 15 minCook 55 minServes 4 as a side or part of a spread125g black riceSalt and black pepper½ small butternut squash (500g), peeled, seeds discarded and cut into 1cm thick half-moons2 fennel bulbs (600g), trimmed and cut into 1cm slices2 red chillies, 1 left whole and 1 thinly sliced (deseeded if you don’t like heat) 1½ tsp fennel seeds, crushed 75ml olive oil3 tbsp maple syrup 1 small garlic bulb, top trimmed to expose the cloves2 banana shallots (100g), skin on, tops trimmed to expose the flesh 1 tbsp lemon juice5g dill, finely chopped5g chives, finely choppedHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7. Put the rice in a medium saucepan with plenty of water, put on a medium heat, bring to a boil and cook for 35 minutes, then add a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Continue to cook for five minutes, until cooked but with a slight bite, then drain very well and transfer to a large bowl.As the rice cooks, put the butternut squash, fennel, the whole chilli and fennel seeds in a large, 40 x 30cm tray lined with baking paper, and add two tablespoons of oil, two and a half tablespoons of maple syrup, a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Mix well, then spread out as much as possible. Drizzle a little oil over the garlic bulb and shallots, wrap inidually in foil and put in the corners of the tray. Roast for about 40 minutes, until the vegetables are golden brown.Transfer half the fennel and squash to the rice bowl, reserving the rest to top the rice with.Once cool enough to handle, discard the foil and squeeze the shallots and garlic into the small bowl of a food processor, discarding the papery skins. Add a tablespoon of oil, the remaining half-tablespoon of maple syrup, half the lemon juice and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and blitz to a smooth paste, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the paste to the rice and veg mixture and gently combine, then transfer to a large serving plate.Top with the remaining roasted vegetables. Mix the herbs with the sliced chilli, the remaining lemon juice, the remaining two tablespoons of oil and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt. Stir together, spoon over the vegetables and serve.I use a shop-bought, cooked brown basmati and wild rice mix here, but you can just as easily use leftover home-cooked rice (white, brown or whatever you have on hand). Make sure you start frying very soon after the batter has been mixed, because it doesn’t sit very well.

Add the garlic and continue to fry for 30 seconds to a minute, until fragrant.Add the milk, lower the heat to medium and simmer gently for five minutes, until thickened and reduced slightly. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for five minutes, then stir in the rice, egg yolks and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until completely cool.Meanwhile, set 160g of the kimchi aside, to serve. Squeeze the remaining kimchi through a sieve, collecting three tablespoons of the liquid in a small serving bowl (set this aside for later), and transferring the drained kimchi solids to a chopping board (you should have 320g). Roughly chop the kimchi, then add to the pan with the cooled rice mixture, along with the green beans, coriander, gruyere, sesame seeds and flour. Stir until fully combined.Whip the egg whites, by hand or with an electric whisk, until you get stiff peaks, then gently fold through the rice mixture until combined.Heat the sunflower oil in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat until it reaches about 180C350F. Test the oil is hot enough by dropping in a tiny bit of batter it should sizzle but not colour straight away. Fry the fritters in four batches (three at a time), to avoid lowering the temperature of the oil too much. Using a large serving spoon, carefully drop 95g of batter per fritter into the oil, and fry for four to five minutes, turning a few times, until golden-brown all over turn the heat down if they’re browning too quickly. Transfer the fritters to a tray lined with kitchen paper, and continue in this way with the remaining batter.Add the lemon juice to the bowl with the reserved kimchi liquid. Transfer the fritters to a large platter, sprinkling over the remaining sesame seeds and a light sprinkling of salt. Serve hot with the kimchi sauce, lemon wedges and the reserved kimchi alongside.I have published a recipe for dirty rice before, and it included ground meat and offal, which give this southern dish, which I picked up in New Orleans, its usual stained look.This non-traditional, but equally delicious vegetarian version (or vegan, if you leave out the butter) uses caramelised onions, black garlic and chestnuts to generate serious flavours and that signature “dirty” look.Cajun spice blends vary in levels of heat and added salt, so you may need to adjust how much you add according to taste.Prep 20 minCook 35 minServes 4 as a side200g basmati rice85ml olive oil Salt7 garlic cloves, peeled, 4 finely sliced and 3 crushed50g unsalted butter (or an extra 50ml olive oil, to keep it vegan)3 onions, peeled and finely chopped (350g)180g ready-cooked and peeled chestnuts, finely chopped25g black garlic (about 15 cloves), finely chopped1½ tbsp Cajun spice blend (I use Bart’s)150ml vegetable stock or water 10g parsley, finely chopped1 tbsp lemon juiceAdd the rice, two teaspoons of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and 400ml boiling water to a medium saucepan, for which you have a lid, on a medium-high heat. Turn the heat to low, cover the pan and leave to cook for 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside, covered, for 10 minutes before fluffing up with a fork.While the rice is cooking, heat three tablespoons of oil in a very small pan on a medium heat. Once hot, fry the sliced garlic, stirring to separate the slices, until pale golden – about two minutes. Watch that you don’t cook it further, or it may burn and turn bitter. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the garlic to a paper-lined plate, reserving the oil. Sprinkle the fried garlic with a little salt and set aside.Add the butter, remaining two tablespoons of oil, onions and crushed garlic to a large, nonstick saute pan on a high heat. Fry for about 14 minutes, resisting the urge to stir too often, until the onions are a deep golden-brown. The onions should catch on the bottom of the pan every now and then, but shouldn’t burn, so turn the heat down if necessary.Reduce the heat to medium-high, add the chestnuts, black garlic, Cajun spices and a half-teaspoon of salt, and continue to fry for seven minutes, stirring every now and then, until everything is a deep, dark-brown colour, but not burned.Stir the rice into the mixture until fully combined, and increase the heat to high. Once the rice at the bottom of the pan begins to crisp up a little – two to three minutes – add the stock and cook, undisturbed, until it has evaporated – another two minutes or so. Remove from the heat, stir through the parsley, garlic slices, lemon juice and reserved garlic oil, and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e3942c1340c39eda44170a28cf174b33aee190b/3_159_4202_2521/master/4202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4aa2fc2a0ba4783fec61f146708c0c53","title":"alexis sanchez manchester united inter milan loan","story":"Internazionale are hoping to sign Alexis Sánchez on a season-long loan and are confident of agreeing a deal with Manchester United.The striker turned down a move to Roma last week, with United reported to have offered to cover a large proportion of his £300,000-a-week wages. Yet having already signed Romelu Lukaku for £74m, the Inter manager, Antonio Conte, has turned his attention to the 30-year-old after missing out on Edin Dzeko, who has signed a new three-year contract with Roma amid speculation he could move to San Siro.Fernando Llorente – currently without a club having left Tottenham at the end of last season – is understood to be another option for the Italians.Sánchez was left out of United’s squad for the opening-day victory over Chelsea, although Ole Gunnar Solskjær said on Friday that the former Arsenal forward was still not ready after playing for his country at the Copa América.“Alexis is such a professional and he comes in working every single day really hard and he wants to be a part of this,” the United manager said. “There are these stories he’s been put in the reserves – of course he hasn’t, he’s part of our squad and he is a really good player. He has had three weeks now, so he’s a few weeks behind the rest but close to being part of it.“We don’t have the biggest forward line in numbers so Alexis might end up playing a lot more games than you expect and we expect him to come good at this club he’s quality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82a00ad959ac8d8ee50523c6f9518466958e8241/0_50_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e99ed0522d60a596168c9e200b2bf051","title":"manchester city tottenham premier league match report","story":"It was an extraordinary finale and, amid all the drama and utter confusion, spare a thought perhaps for those Manchester City supporters who had happily left the stadium, believing they had just seen their team score a dramatic and joyous stoppage-time winner.What they had not accounted for was VAR concluding, after what felt like an age, that the shot from Gabriel Jesus had been preceded by a handball from Aymeric Laporte. Jesus had danced in front of the supporters, wriggling his hips, samba-style. Pep Guardiola and Sergio Agüero, who had fallen out so publicly earlier in the second half, had made up with a touchline embrace. The scoreboard had pronounced it was 3-2. And the Spurs players had all retreated before the signal came that the goal could not stand. And, suddenly, there was a tinny roar from the away end.For City, that was an excruciating moment of deja vu bearing in mind the influence of VAR when these sides met in April’s Champions League quarter-final. The shot-count in their latest encounter was 30-3 in favour of the home team and, in corners, 11-2. Guardiola described it as one of the more illuminating performances of his three-year reign. What City could not do, ultimately, was make the game safe after Raheem Sterling and Agüero had put them in front, twice.Spurs duly nabbed a point courtesy of equalising goals from Érik Lamela and the substitute Lucas Moura, only 19 seconds after coming on, as well as some splendid goalkeeping from Hugo Lloris and various moments of fortune when City, inspired by the brilliance of Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva, threatened to overwhelm them.Nobody should be too harsh on City because they had played stylishly and fully warranted Guardiola’s compliments. That, however, made it an even more painful occasion for the champions because, if there is one lesson to be had from last season, it is that a draw these days is a bad result for a team with title aspirations.This one ended a 15-match winning sequence, going back to January, and the spat between Guardiola and Agüero was probably a measure of their frustrations. It was not the first time the two have clashed and, for an uncomfortable amount of time, Guardiola could be seen flapping his arms and covering his mouth so nobody, bar Agüero, could make out the precise words. Suffice to say, it didn’t look like a “well done”.For Spurs, it was a tough, obdurate performance, albeit one that must have reminded them they are still a considerable distance behind City in terms of pure skill. Not that they should worry too much about that after ending a run of six successive away defeats. If that had extended to seven, it would have equalled their worst run since August to December 2000, when George Graham was in charge.To make matters worse for City, they could legitimately argue they ought to have been awarded a penalty in the first half because of Lamela’s manhandling of Rodri at a corner. The referee, Michael Oliver, evidently did not think a player being grappled to the floor was worthy of being penalised. Neither did the VAR officials, which was mysterious when this was precisely the sort of oversight they should be trying to put right.Amid all this controversy, it also now transpires that Sterling is capable of scoring the kind of expertly placed header that has never previously been listed among the skills of a player who stands at 5ft 6in. Though it helps when De Bruyne is capable of swinging over the kind of beautifully weighted delivery that led to the opening goal.The cross was sumptuous, spinning high in the air before arcing towards the back post. Sterling had turned his body position so when the ball connected with his forehead it went back across Lloris before nestling just inside the side-netting. It was placed to perfection. And, in that precise moment, the television cameras caught Guardiola looking at his coaching staff as if he was a little surprised, too.Their lead lasted three minutes before Lamela strode through the middle to place a left-footed shot past Ederson. Laporte had committed the classic defensive error of turning his back as his opponent shaped to shoot. Twenty yards out, Lamela curled a low effort into the bottom corner.City took the lead for a second time when Agüero darted forwards to turn in another of De Bruyne’s right-sided deliveries and, as a snapshot of how the game was going, how about the moment late in the first half when Bernardo was boxed in by three opponents but gave them all the slip? The olés were memorable as Bernardo eluded Tanguy Ndombele, Danny Rose and Lamela.The problem for City was turning their superiority into more goals and that left them vulnerable to the kind of sucker punch Moura delivered after his 55th-minute introduction for Harry Winks. Lamela swung over the corner from the right. Moura’s header flashed past Ederson and Spurs held on, courtesy of a correct, though late, VAR decision and more evidence of how the sport is changing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fef186ce2b5be35f92008dced3428edb7675cfdf/0_127_3453_2071/master/3453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2dceb1ec38ba384132d7d454ba7ff77","title":"frank lampard chelsea shortcomings manager player","story":"C enturies from now, when the world is a wasteland and football exists only in the ruins of stadiums half-buried in the desert, there will still come a wind through the dusty valley and on its breath will be the question: “But if they were great players, why couldn’t they play together?”The few surviving humans will huddle in caves, squabbling over the meagre crops that remain, ided implacably into two tribes, the Gerrardites and the Lampardians, deaf to the various efforts of minority groups such as the Barryists and the Hargreavesians to unite them, indifferent now as they were then to the proposal of the deposed warlord Capello that it might conceivably work out if only the Gerrardites could occupy the land to the left.It feels at times as though the Lampard-Gerrard debate will forever remain the defining question of our declining civilisation.

But early signs from Lampard’s management are that there are numerous parallels – both promising and more troubling – with how he was as a player.As starts go, away at Old Trafford and then a Super Cup final against the European champions is pretty brutal, and it’s only reasonable to acknowledge that, as he prepares for Sunday’s visit of Leicester. But what’s been striking about Lampard’s two games so far at Chelsea is the problems in the centre of midfield: against Manchester United of a sort that seemed entirely in keeping with his playing career, and against Liverpool that felt a continuation in slightly amended form of many of the problems faced by Maurizio Sarri last season.With the ball, in both games, Chelsea were excellent. There was a pace and a verve to their passing that suggested they will blow away lesser opponents. If they stop clanking first-half shots against the woodwork, they might record impressive wins against top sides as well. The issue was without the ball, at Old Trafford in particular.Although United by the end were rampant, until the second goal went in it still felt as though Chelsea were the likelier winners. Chelsea had 18 shots to United’s 11, seven on target to United’s five.What is telling, though, is that the xG (expected goals) had United winning 2.37-1.37. For all Chelsea’s dominance of the ball, for all Tammy Abraham hit the post and Emerson Palmieri the bar, their lack of compactness meant they could be opened up with gruesome ease, with the result that the opportunities United created on the counter were extremely good ones. Repeatedly exposed, Kurt Zouma was rendered a clumsy parody of the player he appeared to be at Everton last season.Perhaps it’s an unfair comparison, born from the fact that Lampard’s playing career remains so fresh in the memory, but my mind went back to a World Cup qualifier in Vienna in September 2004 and the vast swathes of space that opened up for Austria as they came from 2-0 down to draw with England. David James ended up as the scapegoat that night but at least as problematic was the lack of protection afforded the back four by the Lampard-Gerrard midfield.Add in the fact that Opta stats show that Lampard’s Derby conceded a greater proportion of their goals to fast counters than any other side in the Championship last season and the conclusion seems obvious: if Lampard couldn’t organise a midfield he was playing in, why should he be able to organise one he’s directing from the technical area?Football, though, is rarely as straightforward as that and a feature of Lampard’s brief managerial career so far has been the speed with which he has learned. The most notable example of that, perhaps, is the way, after suffering three defeats to Leeds last season, he made tactical adjustments in the fourth that were critical in Derby reaching the play-off final. There must have been fears that Chelsea would be exposed against Liverpool, who are arguably the best team in the world at countering at speed – but they were not.The return of N’Golo Kanté, of course, was a major benefit his energy and reading of the game would help solidify any midfield. But even then there is reason for concern, largely because Lampard ran into the issue Sarri never quite resolved: it’s extremely difficult to fit Jorginho and Kanté into the same side. They are very different players to Lampard and Gerrard – and indeed to each other – but the basic problem is similar: two players who want to operate in the same space on the pitch.The thought had been that Lampard, who used both 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 at Derby last season, might abandon Sarri’s eternal 4-3-3 for a system that allowed him to play Kanté alongside Jorginho, ideally with a creator in front to offer a goal threat from midfield that Chelsea have been without since the departure of Cesc Fàbregas.In Istanbul, though, he stuck to Sarri’s policy of deploying Jorginho centrally with Kanté to his right and Mateo Kovacic to his left. Although Kanté excelled, Jorginho’s defensive limitations were a major problem. After Roberto Firmino had come on, Jorginho never got to grips with a player dropping into his zone and for Sadio Mané’s second, he was drawn to the ball, leaving the Liverpool forward free on the edge of the penalty area.To an extent, Lampard’s difficulties are the result of the make-up of the squad but that isn’t going to change any time soon. There is a need for him to show he can find defensive balance, and find it in a way that isn’t entirely reliant on Kanté."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6cda04c1907bcf0c05936961137909f2aebe058/0_2145_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77881e242da7c975e78dff92bea4907a","title":"dramatic spaces raising the curtain on an actors bolthole","story":"The actor’s penthouse provides a welcome escape from the ‘chaos and madness’ of life on screenBringing your work home with you takes on a whole new meaning in Dominic Cooper’s Victorian terraced property in north London. One bedroom is furnished entirely with pieces from the New York hotel room set seen in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again in which he reprises his character Sky. “I really needed to do the room up quickly and so I bought all of the furniture from that set after the film was finished. I call it the Mamma Mia! floor.”Occupying the second and third floors of a three-storey terrace, the property comprised a two-bedroom flat on the third floor and a one-bedroom on the second floor when Cooper bought it. Seeing the potential to extend into the eves of the roof, he enlisted E2 architects to create an upper floor open-plan loft-style kitchen-living space, adding reclaimed rustic timber joists in the ceiling and an exposed brick wall to contrast with the grey brick tiles in the sleek, modern white kitchen. A skylight punctuates the wood joists, flooding the room with natural light. “I’ve been slowly working my way down the building,” says Cooper, “buying different bits of it and turning it into a home.” The actor first stumbled across the property when he and his former flatmate James Corden were looking for places to buy. “The area had the same feel to it as Blackheath where I grew up, and I loved its proximity to Soho,” he says. “It’s so important to have a cosy nest to come back to, in among the chaos and madness of having a job where I travel so much. One of my favourite things now is to walk through Regent’s Park and get into the heart of the city. It’s a really nice, mind-clearing journey through greenery into the hustle and bustle.”A place to relax, the flat has also been a party pad in its time. “I actually have a letter framed on my wall from my next-door neighbour when she was much younger, which says, ‘Please, Mr Cooper, I have my Spelling B competition tomorrow morning and it’s now 5am and you’re still playing drum and bass.’”The home mixes modern design pieces, collected vintage furniture and an unusual number of lamps. “I have a kind of light fetish,” he admits. In the upper living area a record player from New Orleans sits on an old teak Danish sideboard and piles of photography books hold up a rickety glass coffee table that once belonged to a friend’s father, a scenic artist at the Royal Opera House.“He lived on a houseboat in Chelsea and that table reminds me of so many great times we had on the boat, like wonderful New Year’s Eve parties.” A rather sturdier dining table from Roche Bobois takes centre stage in the kitchen, with a set of Eames 1958 aluminium chairs.Prints of the Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers album cover and Kraftwerk’s 1975 Radio-Activity hang on the walls, the latter a gift from a friend for the opening night of the play Phèdre at the National Theatre, in which Dominic starred as Hippolytus opposite Helen Mirren.Downstairs, a figurative sculpture by his grandmother hides in a wall nook, and her sculpture of a ballerina swirling around in a snow globe is perched on the glass shelves in the guest room ensuite.“She sculpted the dancers along with other pieces,” he says. “I used to watch her make them in her conservatory when we lived in Blackheath, and remember her always being covered in clay, so I love having them around the place to remind me of her.” Her Ukiyo-e Japanese art prints, which she bought in the 80s at Liberty, now hang above an antique chest of drawers in one lilac-hued bedroom offset by a brown fabric feature wall that faces a painting of a female nude, another gift, this time from the artist Jonathan Yeo.A cherry maroon wall in an office-turned-guest bedroom provides a bold backdrop for a 60s fold-down bureau and shelves filled with artefacts, vintage cameras and, jokes Cooper, “all my OCD colour-coordinated books.” A bright red padded leather chair – one of two he acquired 15 years ago from the office of theatrical agent Pippa Markham, credited with helping Ian Dury’s acting career – sits under a midcentury glass and wood desk, yet another recycling gem from the set of Mamma Mia!At every turn there are smart colour touches and textures, such as the dark inky green palette in the ensuite bathroom that works a metal and glass industrial aesthetic. A bronze sculpture by his mother blends into the coppery tiled shower walls. “I chose those tiles because they reminded me of the stage in Waiting for Godot, a play I did years ago at drama school. We built this huge cube of rust,” he explains. “When I saw that tile it was exactly the same colour, and I thought it would look great.”There was never a grand interiors masterplan for Cooper’s home, but he likes how it’s worked out. “It’s been a progressive process. I’ve got to know the place and have added things along the way. I’ve loved buying little bits of furniture here and there over the years, and I think the more you do that and accumulate other things from different places, you add parts of your life into the building. It makes for a much more personal space, where each little corner has something to do with someone or somewhere you remember.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ea0938b7af8606b4213e64bf839f711ae5515dd/0_83_2057_1234/master/2057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2942e4bf2407e9bf3831f7a792aacb7","title":"leonard bernstein japanese love letters hashimoto","story":"One was among the most brilliant composers and conductors of the 20th century, a sexagenarian who brought the world one of the great love stories of musical theatre. The other was a 26-year-old who worked in a Tokyo insurance company. Now, a newly revealed cache of letters shows that in the last decade of his life Leonard Bernstein embarked on a passionate relationship with a Japanese man.“I noticed that he was gazing upon me,” Kunihiko Hashimoto, now 66, said. It is hard to explain about his eyes. It was not to try to talk to me nor seduce me, just he was looking at me. It was irresistible.”Hashimoto’s role in Bernstein’s life had been almost completely overlooked until Mari Yoshihara, a Japanese-American academic, discovered some 350 letters at the Library of Congress in Washington. She found that they first met in 1979, when Hashimoto went backstage with a friend after a concert and ended up spending the night with Bernstein.The West Side Story composer was visiting Tokyo with the New York Philharmonic and when he left Hashimoto was devastated. The following day, he wrote to him: “After you left Japan, my mind became vacant, because the one night and afternoon that we had were like a beautiful dream.”Yoshihara, professor of American Studies at the University of Hawaii, said her “jaw dropped” when she first read the letters, having stumbled across them by chance in the library’s Bernstein collection.“They’ve got 1,700 boxes of some 400,000 items,” she said, “including manuscripts… It’s completely overwhelming. I was going through it and, by accident, came across these personal letters to Bernstein from two Japanese iniduals whose names I didn’t recognise.”Intrigued, she asked to see the rest of the correspondence: “It completely changed the course of my project.”Hashimoto’s letters  about 11 years until the summer of 1990, a few months before Bernstein’s death, aged 72. Yoshihara found that the Japanese man’s name appears only briefly in the most comprehensive Bernstein biography – as a business representative.“Beyond that, I couldn’t find anything about him,” she said. “He was working for an insurance company when he first met Bernstein. A few years after their relationship began, because Hashimoto was already an amateur actor, he auditioned for a major musical theatre company in Japan and became an actor. Bernstein’s manager later invited him to become the composer’s Japan representative ... Hashimoto played a crucial role in some of Bernstein’s major projects in his late career, including organising the Hiroshima peace concerts in 1985.”Their relationship went far beyond sexual intimacy. Hashimoto went on to work as a writer, director and producer in Australia and Japan, and his productions included a translation of Bernstein’s musical Candide.Bernstein, according to his West Side Story collaborator Arthur Laurents, was “a gay man who got married. He wasn’t conflicted about it at all. He was just gay.”After the death of his wife, actress Felicia Cohn Montealegre, in 1978, he had many lovers. Although Hashimoto was not the only object of Bernstein’s affections, the love was not unrequited, according to Yoshihara: “It was mutual. On two occasions Bernstein arranged to bring Hashimoto to Europe to spend time with him.”In one letter, Hashimoto wrote: “I have received the tenderest letter from you. I read it over and over again.”Describing the correspondence as “passionate, tender and sometimes heartbreaking”, Yoshihara said: “Hashimoto’s words exude every emotion of a young man who has fallen deeply in love.”The Japanese man was taken aback when he was told by Yoshihara that she had read his letters. “He was very shocked … He hadn’t even known that the letters were available for viewing at the Library of Congress,” she said. But she secured his trust once he realised that her forthcoming book, Dearest Lenny: Letters from Japan and the Making of the World Maestro (Oxford University Press, £19.99), is a scholarly study of Bernstein interwoven with the history, politics and economics of the 20th century.It will include Hashimoto’s letters, one of which reads: “I never forget that you asked me where we should live. Your question was where ‘we’ should live, wasn’t it?’ I would like to live with you. Even as a maid (but I am not good at cooking and sewing). Even as a secretary (but I cannot type quickly). Even as like a doll (but I have a mind) … I was born to meet you and to be with you.”Elsewhere, he wrote: “The letters you wrote to me … the pictures I took in Munich, Positano, Amsterdam, and the presents you gave me … I have kept all of them and locked them in a briefcase.”Yoshihara’s book, which is to be published on 2 September in the US and 28 November in the UK, also includes previously unpublished missives from a Japanese woman, also held in the Library of Congress: Kazuko Amano began writing fan letters to Bernstein in 1947 and became a close family friend over more than four decades.

Raised in Hertfordshire, she studied music and visual arts at the University of Brighton and worked as a nursery school teacher for four years before committing to music full-time. A rich seam of theatricality was woven into her songwriting from the start, taking shape in elaborate outfits and intense stage performances. Three of her four Bat for Lashes albums to date, including 2006 debut Fur and Gold, have been nominated for the Mercury prize (Khan also released an album via her side project Sexwitch in 2015). Her latest album, Lost Girls, comes out next month.Was there an overarching concept?I was developing a script for a film called The Lost Girls. It was heavily influenced by 80s children’s films and vampire films, many set in Portland and California. But as the songs progressed, I felt like I was writing the film soundtrack. Music does tend to overtake film ideas, as it comes out much more easily.Which 80s films did you have in mind?The Lost Boys, obviously, is a close link, and seeing LA’s hazy sunsets is making me think of films like ET and The Goonies. Moving to LA, I’ve basically been plonked inside the sets of all the films I loved as a kid.What switched you on to music?I saw Michael Jackson on his Bad tour when I was nine, with my mum, and I remember his Thriller video coming out – that was really exciting. And later on, seeing how pop musicians like Kate Bush and David Bowie were using the more theatrical aspects of music had a big influence on me. At art college, the way we approached music was very closely linked with visual art and performance. With my first band I said, “I want us to make headdresses”, and so we’d go down to the haberdashery and buy a bunch of sequins and old lady broaches in antique shops. It was a hodgepodge and it probably didn’t even make sense, but I was trying to figure out how we were going to stand out on stage and express ourselves in a playful way.What’s been the most surreal experience of your career so far?It’s always surreal when people I love come to shows, like Björk turning up to one of my first big shows in London, or seeing Tilda Swinton in the audience. Or supporting Radiohead on tour – as a teenager I was listening to The Bends every day on the train to school, and then 10 years later I’m supporting them around Europe. It’s also surreal when I make a video based on something I’ve had in my imagination for a really long time, and then I find myself stepping into my own dream. Who gets to do that?Have you acclimatised to California?I do love LA for its landscapes and light, and the optimism and ambition of the people, but being English I’m very aware that I probably couldn’t exist there for a long time. I miss the seasons, the grittiness and the English sense of humour. And part of the reality in America is having no health insurance. And heat that melts the pavements and so much traffic and smog. But there’s no perfect place.By temperament, do you lean towards sunny Californian optimism or British gloom?I go between the two. I think this album is demonstrating a side of me that’s happy and loves to dance, laugh and be silly – that’s a big part of who I am. I spent a long time trawling the depths and the darkness in my music. But being in LA, maybe it has liberated that side of me that is more fun.Do you keep up with the news?I’m obviously aware of things that are happening, but I don’t give a lot of time and energy to it, because it’s become such a big ball of knots. We used to think that we could rely on things we saw in the news to be real, but at the moment everything’s being exposed as lies and no one seems to really know what’s going on. It adds a lot to my anxiety and confusion, so I think my time is much better spent creating work that is quite positive and sublimating all these worries into something a bit more productive.You’re approaching your 40s. How do you feel about it?There’s a side of me that can’t believe I’m going to be 40, because I feel so young, and because what I do tethers me to a part of my psyche that’s full of childlike wonder. There’s a sadness about accepting that you’re getting older, and the way society views age doesn’t help. But when I think about all the people I have admired, film-makers and writers, they only get better with age. For me, I feel doors are only opening, not closing.Lost Girls is released via AWAL on 6 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0a906ccae6bc18c98c2a23333d0bd07dfefee8d/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2eec01d83572b55ebc2bc739b2c54a8b 1760w","title":"labour to give councils power to seize boarded up shops","story":"Abandoned buildings could be turned into community centres in push to revive high streetsLabour will allow councils to seize abandoned shops to give them a new lease of life as cooperatives or community centres, a policy designed to revive struggling high streets.Jeremy Corbyn is expected to announce the shake-up on a visit to a high street in Bolton on Saturday, calling the sight of boarded-up shops a “symptom of economic decay” which is lowering living standards.Under the Labour proposals, local authorities could offer properties which had been vacant for 12 months to startups, cooperative businesses and community projects.“Boarded-up shops are a symptom of economic decay under the Conservatives and a sorry symbol of the malign neglect so many communities have suffered,” Corbyn will say.“Once-thriving high streets are becoming ghost streets. Labour has a radical plan to revive Britain’s struggling high streets by turning the blight of empty shops into the heart of the high street, with thousands of new businesses and projects getting the chance to fulfil their potential.”Initiatives to regenerate high streets were a key policy pledge at Labour’s party conference and are understood to be a significant part of the party’s strategy in less-affluent towns, particularly those in the Midlands and north-east targeted by the Conservatives after the Brexit vote.The party’s five-point plan for reviving the high street includes banning ATM charges and action to dissuade bank branch and post office closures, as well as free bus travel for under-25s and a review of the business rates system.The shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, said: “Under this government, our high streets have suffered a retail apocalypse. High-street closures are at a historic high, leaving too many of our once thriving towns abandoned and awash with boarded-up shop fronts.“Labour’s radical plan will turn around the mess that the Tories have created and will give local authorities the power to make our high streets the pride of our communities that they once were.”Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said more action needed to be taken to stop shops from closing down, rather than just repurposing abandoned buildings.“Small businesses on our high streets are under pressure like never before, with costs rising, employment burdens weighing heavy and political uncertainty – and rows of boarded-up shops do not make for a healthy or inspiring town centre,” he said.“While finding new ways to reopen closed shops is positive, this is after the fact they have shut. Sustainable, erse and thriving high streets rest on good local investment to make the public realm more attractive, and stopping rents and rates bills becoming unaffordable for businesses in the first place.”The communities minister, Jake Berry, dismissed the proposal, alleging that Labour’s tax policies would cause more businesses to leave high streets. “Jeremy Corbyn would wreck the economy, tax small businesses and scare off the investment needed to help our high streets, meaning more boarded-up shops and fewer jobs,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b02bd74a4ffcab687fa2ef7a55fd55d020ccfe13/0_263_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18708327ce85e7692906e42f9999d32b","title":"labour tory mps unite plot radical law stop no deal brexit","story":"Senior Labour and Conservative MPs leading the battle to stop a no-deal Brexit are focusing on passing a “radical” new law to block it, after concluding that there is no imminent prospect of toppling Boris Johnson and installing an emergency government.Last week was punctuated by rows among MPs over who should lead a temporary government to stop a no-deal Brexit, with the Lib Dems and other MPs refusing to back any move that would put Jeremy Corbyn in No 10.However, those planning to use legislation to stop the UK crashing out of the EU believe there is a growing majority for their plans and think No 10 will be unable to stop them.Shadow cabinet members and cabinet ministers who departed with the arrival of Johnson are among those backing the strategy in preference to a no-confidence vote in the prime minister. They believe the hardline tactics deployed by Dominic Cummings, who ran the Vote Leave campaign and is now the prime minister’s key adviser, have swelled the numbers prepared to act.“This is not the time for boring and neutral tactics,” said one figure involved. “This isn’t a time for typical deference. These people will show no deference and give no quarter – and we need to be just as ruthless and organised as they are.”A senior Labour figure said: “People are slightly barking up the wrong tree. My strong view is that there is a clear majority to try to stop no deal. It’s stronger now because those coming out of the cabinet are undoubtedly swelling the numbers, but also swelling the morale on the Tory side to do something. It feels like the majority is stronger than it was and the determination is stronger.”A third figure said: “For my money, I don’t think a no-confidence vote will be particularly winnable in early September – even some opposition MPs wouldn’t back it. Why go for that when there’s a more direct route?”MPs plan to pass a law stating that the prime minister must request a delay to Brexit to avoid a no-deal outcome. However, their challenge has been to find a parliamentary device enabling them to do so. There are no guarantees of success, but tactics include amending a vote relating to the Northern Ireland executive, altering parliament’s standing orders, and using an emergency debate to seize control of the parliamentary timetable – which is not usually allowed under parliament’s current rulebook.The stakes are high. Dominic Grieve, a Tory MP who has been a leader of the efforts, said that he had received death threats as a result of Johnson’s Brexit rhetoric.Downing Street is said to be holding daily meetings about how to delay legislation in September – a tactic designed to take away opportunities for MPs to hijack government plans with measures opposing no deal. However, rebels already believe they can act without any legislation being presented by the government. “They are planning on how to take away any hooks, but we don’t need hooks,” said one of those involved.Some insiders have been pleased that much public attention has been focused on the idea of a government of national unity, which took the spotlight off their plans to seize control of parliament and pass an anti-no-deal law next month. Others are also happy that ideas are being stressed-tested now. One former minister said: “I don’t think it’s a bad use of the summer for unworkable ideas to be aired, scrutinised and dismissed.”The row over who should lead a unity government following a no-confidence vote in Johnson’s administration was ignited when Jo Swinson, the new Lib Dem leader, rejected Corbyn’s offer to lead a temporary government as “a nonsense”. Swinson has since softened her rhetoric.Corbyn’s letter offering to lead a temporary government came after Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, and Swinson discussed cross-party efforts to stop no deal. “It was absolutely the right thing for Jeremy to do and forced the Lib Dems into an error,” said a Labour MP usually critical of Corbyn.Most accept that, while Swinson was too dismissive of Corbyn’s offer, she was right to conclude that a Corbyn-led emergency government was a non-starter. Opponents of no deal calculate that at least eight Tory rebels would be needed, and some of the most likely have already this ruled out.MPs in all parties are already discussing ways of sidelining Corbyn by seeing if there is enough support for a unity leader, such as Harriet Harman or Ken Clarke, who would not require the support of Labour’s front bench. Ultimately, several Labour MPs believe Corbyn will back a unity figure if his own attempt to form a government has failed and no deal looms.“He’ll get a bite of the cherry – no one can stop him trying to form a government,” said one MP. “The real issue is, after that, will he make way or see no deal happen? That is coming down the road.”Meanwhile, many Conservatives still hope Johnson will return to the Commons at the 11th hour with one last chance to vote for a Brexit deal similar to that offered by Theresa May. They believe Labour MPs opposed to a second referendum, such as Lisa Nandy, could be convinced to back it. While most are convinced that Cummings is prepared to leave the EU without a deal, some also expect serving ministers to rebel should such an outcome look imminent.“I just think their inner Tory who cares about the economy will scream at ministers as it did for Theresa May,” said one former minister. “I think Cummings will be told ‘no’ and then sort of explode like a Dr Who dalek whose wires are fatally crossed, screaming ‘exterminate.’”Jeremy Corbyn has offered to lead a temporary government tasked with requesting a delay to Brexit from the EU, before triggering an election.Likelihood: one in fiveJo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has said Corbyn cannot command enough support to lead a temporary government. She has instead suggested a temporary government of national unity, led by a more neutral figure such as Labour’s Harriet Harman or veteran Tory Ken Clarke.Likelihood: two in fiveMPs such as Dominic Grieve, Oliver Letwin, Nick Boles and Yvette Cooper have been part of efforts to pass new legislation that orders the prime minister to request a Brexit delay to avoid no deal.Likelihood: three in fiveSome MPs are still holding out hope that Boris Johnson will offer them a vote on a Brexit deal based on the agreement put forward by Theresa May. For it to pass, Labour MPs opposed to a second referendum, such as Lisa Nandy, would have to back it.Likelihood: two in five"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b68d24d475107acdc2a79b7094eae41a97f5b970/0_111_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e28e186303258c2b5f3d048c9c3aa3e","title":"sajid javid announces 600m of new infrastructure spending","story":"Chancellor says spending could ‘unlock’ construction of up to 50,000 homes in London, south-east and East AngliaSajid Javid has announced more than £600m of new infrastructure spending that will potentially support the construction of up to 50,000 homes in London, the south-east and east of England.The funding, which will come from the Housing Infrastructure Fund (HIF) that Javid launched in July 2017 when he was secretary of state for communities and local government, will go towards the building of roads, rail links, schools and other infrastructure projects.Almost £220m will be spent in Essex on a bypass and a new train station to the north of Chelmsford, which could support 14,000 new homes. Another £100m will be spent on a new road near Colchester that could lead to the construction of 7,500 homes.London will receive around £240m for two schemes in Enfield and the east of the capital, while just under £70m will be spent in central Bedfordshire to build a new secondary school and transport infrastructure.The chancellor said: “I want to see more homes built in the places people want to live, so more people realise the dream of homeownership.“But we need the roads, rail links, and schools to support the families living in those homes, which is why I set up a fund to put in place the infrastructure to unlock new homes in these areas.”The government’s £5.5bn housing fund has already allocated more than £1.6bn on 243 projects across the country, including rail links in Cumbria and transport infrastructure in Devon and Cornwall.London’s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the funding, tweeting: “I’m delighted we have secured funding for more frequent Overground services, station upgrades and other infrastructure to support growth in Enfield, Canada Water, New Bermondsey and Deptford – unlocking 21,000 homes that Londoners so desperately need.”The announcement will further fuel rumours that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is planning a blitz of public spending in the runup to a general election. But in an interview with the Times, Javid said “that when it comes to spending, you’ve got to pick priorities. Not everything can be a priority.”However, the chancellor’s commitment to infrastructure projects means that further projects are likely to unveiled in the future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4fb5a94a318bf6c3c0e092f63f33de95bcc4f3b/0_719_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81c8106ce0d122951973090ffc569505","title":"students hired by gambling apps to entice peers to bet","story":"Students at prestigious UK universities are being recruited to promote betting apps on campus and, in some cases, are handing out free cash to entice others to gamble.An investigation by the Observer has found that students are being headhunted by marketing agencies that claim they are working on behalf of betting companies.At the University of Manchester, student promoters encouraged peers to take advantage of “free bets” on two gambling apps, Kwiff and BetBull, by handing out £5 notes around campus and other meeting places.Critics have condemned the marketing agencies for the “unscrupulous” ploy of targeting impressionable young people, and the National Union of Students raised concerns over the “deplorable tactics”. The makers of the apps, who contract the marketing agencies to promote their products, have denied any involvement in, or knowledge of, the scheme.Students can reportedly earn up to £12 for every person they sign up. Recruitment is often done by sharing links on social media but some students employ face-to-face marketing.It is unclear if handing out cash or gifts is encouraged by the marketing agencies, or if some students have taken the matter into their own hands, but one student promoter said they were given little guidance on accepting the job. The undergraduate said: “The goal is to get people to download the app and make a bet... it’s pretty much up to us.”It also denied any knowledge of marketing companies handing out gifts on its behalf. “This would be considered a breach of contract and would lead to immediate termination of an affiliate contract.”BetBull said that the flyer with its logo on being given out at universities was unauthorised. “Nobody at BetBull was aware of, or sanctioned, its production or distribution. Betbull does not tolerate or condone this practice – we take our marketing compliance obligations extremely seriously and ensure that our marketing affiliates are fully and regularly trained on these compliance requirements. We take all available measures to prevent misuse of our branding and have launched a full investigation into this matter.”The NUS commissioned a report into students and gambling at the end of last year and found that some undergraduates were gambling their student loan to afford increased living costs.The University of Manchester declined to comment other than saying it hadn’t had anything to do with the gambling app jobs.

Everybody thinks they are the best in the race. That’s how sprints work and that’s how it’s got to be. And I want to win.”The 23-year-old proved she was world class in Berlin last year, clocking world-leading times of 10.85sec and 21.89 to break her own national records, as she won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay. However, she knows she will have her work cut out on Sunday when she headlines the Birmingham Diamond League in a 200m that oozes extreme class and guile.When she looks around on the starting blocks she will see a who’s who of sprinting: Dafne Schippers, the world champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, a double Olympic gold medallist and seven-times world champion Blessing Okagbare and Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who have run the second and third fastest times in the world this year. There will also be a host of other top sprinters who are likely to be in the world championship finals in Doha next month.But the message from Asher-Smith is clear: bring it on. “You can’t be daunted by anybody,” she says. “There’s nobody in track and field who is infallible or unable to be beaten.”Her confidence is understandable. Asher-Smith has run under 11 seconds for the 100m three times this season and won two of her three Diamond League races over 200m, and she intends to double up in Doha. She also has happy memories of Birmingham, where she ran a personal best and nearly took down the legendary Allyson Felix as a teenager in 2015.“I love racing here,” she says. “One of my favourite races ever was in Birmingham when I first raced against Allyson and I ran a massive PB out of nowhere of 22.30sec. I was so dead I threw up on Ricky Simms’ shoes afterwards! It was right next to the media tent and I said to him: ‘How am I going to do media?’ And he said: ‘You’ll be fine!’“So I remember running out my skin here before and, obviously, I got rewarded,” she adds. “So I’m coming to run out my skin again. I’m naturally quite a chilled and quiet person but whenever I step on to the track, I’m fiercely competitive and every time I step on the line, I’m here to win.“I love running in the UK and I’m really happy I get to run in the UK late in the season and closer to the world championships. It’s not quite a final goodbye for the worlds but it’s as close as we can get.”And she is not even scared by the thought of facing someone as great as Fraser-Pryce, who ran an astonishing 10.73 earlier this season for 100m after coming back from pregnancy.“It actually makes me focus more,” she says. “I can’t be daunted by somebody else’s thing. If they want to break the world record, there’s nothing I can do to control it. All I can do is control my own performances. I am looking to do the best I can and if it comes in a nice glittery form in Doha then I will be really happy but even if it doesn’t and I run fast times I will have to take it.”Event organisers have confirmed that more than 60 global medallists – including 10 reigning Olympic champions, two Paralympic champions and 13 reigning world champions – will compete at the Alexander Stadium.While the world indoor champion, Christian Coleman, has pulled out, there is still a strong 100m field including Akani Simbine – the Commonwealth champion – the triple Olympic medallist Andre De Grasse and the former European champion Adam Gemili. In the 400m, the European champion, Matt Hudson-Smith, returns to action in his local stadium for the men’s 400m – his first race since September 2018.British eyes will also be on the long jump clash between Katarina Johnson-Thompson and her great heptathlon rival Nafi Thiam. Both women are focusing more on Doha, and are not expected to challenge the event specialists for victory. However, Johnson-Thompson, who has a personal best of 6.93m, intends to leave her mark, by inching somewhere closer to her best.“It’s definitely important,” explained Johnson-Thompson. “It’s one of my strongest events but I haven’t been at the level which I’d like recently. So if I can produce a big jump, it would give me confidence.”Thiam, meanwhile, is playing down their rivalry. “It’s great that Katarina is here because we know each other and I’m used to competing with her, but it’s a long jump competition,” she said. “We’re not in a heptathlon, so I don’t think winning is the point here. I just want to see where I am. In Doha it will be something else but here, I’m not putting pressure on myself to win. But I think it’s going to be very interesting in Doha.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18b758282500e4a060d7b10a8b76c969bf1c927c/0_167_4997_2998/master/4997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9e85ad2fbe6163a96bc1f6196f1c663","title":"smith archer second test england australia ashes","story":"• Second Test, day four: England 258 \u0026amp 96-4 Australia 250• England struggling after epic duel has crowd captivatedA mid-afternoon duel between two contrasting, charismatic characters eclipsed the match situation at Lord’s for a while. For once the back-page headlines were trustworthy. The critical contest was between Jofra Archer, England’s newest and fastest paceman, and Steve Smith, the indomitable former Test captain of Australia returning to his cherished natural habitat in the middle order, and it had a full house spellbound.True pace bowling has always been a compelling spectacle and on the sort of balmy day when a post-prandial nap had its attractions Archer and Smith commanded the absolute attention of everyone. The rhythmic clapping of spectators in time with Archer’s cruise to the crease kept even the well-lubricated awake. Sometimes the ball flew way over the outstretched gloves of Jonny Bairstow behind the stumps.It was a flamboyant cover drive from Smith that seemed to trigger Archer to press his accelerator to the limit. Australia’s finest was hit on the arm, which prompted him to flap at a couple short deliveries as the radar traced a cricket ball travelling in excess of 95mph. Then, on 80, Smith was felled by a short ball that struck his neck just below the helmet. He sank to the ground and stayed there for a while eventually he was helped to his feet the medics examined him. Smith wanted to stay but he was persuaded by the experts to go back to the pavilion. He must have been a bit disorientated since he set off without his precious bat, which was still lying at the crease.Out came Peter Siddle as we tried to gauge the significance of what we had just witnessed. Before long Siddle was dismissed by Chris Woakes and peering into the distance there was the sight of the new batsman fidgeting elaborately as he entered the playing surface. This was a new routine for Nathan Lyon then, to general consternation, came the realisation that this was not Lyon but Smith. He proceeded to strike three boundaries from various parts of his bat, whereupon he padded up to a straight ball from Woakes. He reviewed the lbw and yet immediately set off for the pavilion.For once Smith was not in absolute control of the situation – and he had just missed out on his third consecutive century.Archer had bowled eight overs and taken 1-31 in that mid-afternoon spell, mundane-looking figures that disguised the significance of his spell.This was manna from heaven for any captain, pace on a different plane to ordinary mortals and for the first time in the series he had made Smith, the titan of Edgbaston, look like an ordinary mortal. Stuart Broad and Woakes took more wickets as Australia were bowled out for 250 but this was the day that Archer announced himself as a cricketer likely to adorn the Test scene for a long time provided he stays fit.Even a diminished Smith was central to Australia almost matching England’s total. This is not a sub-standard pitch but batting remains a trial. Aside from Smith the only contributions of note came from the patient vigils of Tim Paine and Pat Cummins. They were reluctant to attack an accurate Jack Leach, which suggested that priority number one for Australia was to protect their 1-0 lead rather than go full steam ahead for a second victory. However, those priorities may have changed once England started batting and the delicacy of the match situation took over once again.It has not been a great series for opening batsmen, with only Rory Burns prospering so far. For Jason Roy the pursuit of a 21st century positive is tricky but not quite impossible: he avoided a pair. He tucked a single on the leg side but in the fifth over a leading edge against a short ball from Cummins was athletically held by the back-pedalling bowler.Already Roy’s position must be up for debate among the selectors. There is even the rare possibility – as a round of Championship matches start today – that a significant score in county cricket might trigger a change, though this might require Joe Denly to join Burns at the top of the order with the introduction of a middle ordernumber three specialist. There is little evidence to suggest Root is enjoying his elevation to number three. He was out first ball.Cummins steamed in, hit a length and Root’s forward push ended with an edge into the gloves of Paine. Root offered an anguished look at a surface with which he is rapidly falling out of love and set off on the long walk back. Burns and Denly contrived a partnership of 55 aided by a couple of escapes.Denly was dropped on seven by David Warner on 24 Burns would have been lbw to Lyon if the Australians had reviewed – the same applied when Ben Stokes was facing the off-spinner later in the day.Then Siddle clung on to a return drive to remove Denly and in his next over delivered a snorter, which found the edge of Burns’s bat. In the meantime Stokes, promoted to number five, snatched six runs from an over from Lyon.All those runs came from the edge of his bat and he was also dropped at slip by Warner. This was harum-scarum cricket as the prospect of a draw dipped with the setting sun. However, Stokes and Jos Buttler hung in for the last three-quarters of an hour. England lead by 104 with six wickets remaining and 98 overs to go. Watch out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0809edbb6560b2c6202a89b71c93319895291de5/0_83_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=665c2a9925a4c3383158d439be8685b4","title":"newbury win technician st leger","story":"• Victory in Geoffrey Freer Stakes rekindles expectations• Trainer says Doncaster classic is now ‘logical next step’Martyn Meade can dream once more of a first Classic success, having got Technician back on track with a surprise victory in the Geoffrey Freer. The 71-year-old trainer has tackled the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby with high hopes in recent seasons, only to see Advertise and Eminent come up short, but next month’s St Leger may provide him with a happier outcome.Technician was himself tried in a couple of Derby trials in the spring and fared respectably when runner-up to Bangkok at Sandown, but Saturday’s performance was a new career best as he outbattled the favourite, Morando, after a protracted duel up the soggy home straight. He took a long time to get on top but looked the likely winner from over a furlong out and appears well suited by a test of stamina.“He’s been a funny horse,” said Meade’s son, Freddie, on duty as assistant trainer while his father was buying yearlings in Deauville. “You have a short amount of time to work these horses out and he’s only had six runs. A galloping track and a bit of juice in the ground, and he just keeps giving and giving.“You need to ask him to give, he doesn’t give it to you without asking. He’s good like that, which means hopefully he’s got a bit of longevity.”Meade Jr pointed out the horse had managed to win over 10 furlongs just a couple of months ago. That now seems a formidable test of speed, by Technician’s standards, and it is impressive that he was able to cope.The St Leger in four weeks’ time was described as “the logical next step” and “a race that’s been on our radar for some time”, and bookmakers duly hastened to cut Technician’s odds. But he was still available at 20-1 by Saturday evening, which seems generous in the context of a race for which the betting is due a shake-up. After all, six of the top eight in betting lists are from Aidan O’Brien’s stable and there must be every chance that half of those will drop out. The current favourite, Japan, seems especially at risk of missing the Leger, since the trainer named other targets last week for the colt, who is being aimed at the Juddmonte International and the Irish Champion.In any case, Technician is hopefully going to be a “Cup” horse for next year, turning up in all the best marathon races. If Straarius has retired by then, he will be a contender. “He’s a nice horse to have,” said Meade Jr.This proved the right day to give another chance to a frustrating animal, as Glorious Journey, who would also fit that description, won the Hungerford Stakes, having gone 361 days since his most recent success. A son of Fallen For You, who won the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot, he won his first two starts in 2017 and was supposed to be a Dewhurst candidate but things have evidently gone sideways since then.“We thought quite a bit of him as a two-year-old,” said James Doyle, the winning jockey. “He’s got a fantastic pedigree, but we just lost him a little bit. I think dropping back in trip has definitely been the making of him.“I hit the front too soon. I tried to hold on to him as long as he could and I was a little bit nervous whether he’d have the tenacity, late on, to hold off Librisa Breeze but that was a sure sign of him growing up.”Connections of Librisa Breeze were also encouraged, considering this was his first start since November and he started at 16-1. The popular grey, a Group One winner in 2017, may have another big day in him at the age of seven. The Prix de la Forêt was mentioned as a possible target and he might clash again with Glorious Journey in that race on Arc weekend.While John Gosden was saddling Terebellum to win the Prix de la Nonette at Deauville, there was a good report here of his star mare Enable, who will run in the Yorkshire Oaks on Thursday. Rab Havlin said he had been impressed when riding her in work on Wednesday and added that she went well again under Frankie Dettori on Saturday.“She normally doesn’t do a lot on the Al Bahathri gallop,” Havlin said, “but she just pulled out and went whoosh. Oh, she’s ready.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde9ee4effdb8fd45521a898c16cb31fc56fc050/112_117_3603_2162/master/3603.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33cb16f9fc379645bf3378223afea56f","title":"why drag is bigger than ever edinburgh festival crystal rasmussen","story":"It used to be that just wearing a dress and lip-syncing was enough. But now drag is mainstream, the bar for this most creative and transgressive art form has been raisedIt’s Friday night at the Edinburgh fringe. Artists are running all over town, weaving around drunk punters and through flooded streets to make their guest spots. In full drag is me, dragging a tent through the rain, my wig swiftly uncurling. I arrive 15 minutes before I am supposed to go on stage, as a guest in someone else’s show. Up there already is a comedian reading from a yellow piece of paper. Next up, a man walks on stage and reads from a white piece of paper. Then it’s my turn: while using two audience volunteers, I spend four minutes erecting a tent while altering the lyrics to a popular ballad, singing live, ad-libbing jokes, wearing a full face of makeup, heels and a wig, all while reinterpreting Susan Sontag’s wondrous (and perhaps problematic) Notes on Camp. All in a day’s work for a drag queen in 2019.When I started drag 10 years ago, the act of raiding your local Primark (without a care in the world for the impending meteorological apocalypse) and sticking on a dress and a plastic wig was deemed radical. Although this practice had existed for hundreds of years – not the Primark bit, but the transgressing gender through dress bit – barely anyone had seen it before. But now, after a stiff cocktail of RuPaul’s Drag Race, social media and the increased acceptance of gender fluidity, there are countless queens out there with more followers than Jeremy Corbyn. Drag is everything the internet could want: colourful, uplifting, funny, beautiful, political, and the key to a wholly different way of life. And so, with more interest came more drag. And naturally, with more drag came higher expectations.So, as queers have had to for centuries, we evolved: we went multi-genre. Genre-fluid, perhaps. Now there are drag performers who can do everything. I know drag artists who can do backflips while singing, who can sew a whole wardrobe, lip-sync the house down, gather entire communities in rural areas together and change people’s minds. Not to blow my own horn, but I can also make you laugh and cry and – as two people have told me this week – pack an emotional punch while also making you feel kind of turned on, all while hitting almost every note in Minnie Riperton’s perfect Loving You.A friend of mine, the brilliant queen Ginger Johnson, who is at the fringe with her show Happy Place, attributes the increasing performance dexterity we now see in drag to our widening cultural diet. “Drag has always been a pastiche of mainstream contemporary culture,” Ginger explains. “Digital life has seen that mainstream broaden, so drag has had to do the same. I think there are also just a lot more queens around than there used to be, which is bringing a lot more cultural influences into the art form. And that can only be a good thing.” Being asked to broaden our practice is no bad thing: it makes our performances richer and more textured.But it also becomes somewhat complicated to know what’s expected of us, too. Spellbinding drag prinx and scene legend Chiyo says they often turn up to gigs and aren’t sure what they should be offering. “Last week I almost did two upbeat, almost nude burlesque numbers to a room of five people in prime daylight in Brighton. It wasn’t until I actually got to the space that I realised they probably wanted me to do an artist talk andor some spoken word.”We must ask why have expectations for us been raised, when expectations for the dominant voices in entertainment – for example those two boys with their pieces of paper – remain the same.Jodi Mitchell, or John Travulva depending on the time of day, is a brilliant drag king and standup who is co-founder of the side-splitting collective The LOL Word. “Every time I perform standup in drag, I have to dissect ‘the point’ of my set – whether there is one or not. Audience members sometimes invent excellent ones for me. I suspect this is because, subconsciously, they know that without there being a message, the point of the performance would just be that I am funny. It would be far too empowering for a non-binary person dressed as a man to just be funny, like male standups are. That would be truly terrifying.”Of course, people who are single-genre should be celebrated for absolutely killing it in their chosen space, especially if they’re really bloody good, but I want to endlessly fanfare the brilliance of queens, kings, prinxs, inbetweeners who get up there and give us, literally, everything. Those who stand up on stage and subvert gender stereotypes, deconstruct power systems through jokes, mine their trauma, cover it in glitter, sing a cappella, all while doing a dance routine with a death drop. These people don’t simply comment on what they see, they offer entirely new ways of seeing it – and that’s real magic.Now I don’t want to be a standup. I love the creativity and means of expression drag offers us. But often it can feel like all this skill is filed under “drag” and then chucked in a basement somewhere. But drag performers are stars, deeply skilled at many things because they have to be. It would be so wonderful for that to be celebrated by more than just a yasss queen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac506cc1e79119d0302d1909feecd1cbfa9e2a4e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=424607061251c7dc710ac76d0d92f3f6","title":"emotion ai artificial intelligence mood realeyes amazon facebook emotient","story":"Advertisers, tech giants and border forces are using face tracking software to monitor our moods – whether we like it or notIt is early July, almost 30C outside, but Mihkel Jäätma is thinking about Christmas. In a co-working space in Soho, the 39-year-old founder and CEO of Realeyes, an “emotion AI” startup which uses eye-tracking and facial expression to analyse mood, scrolls through a list of 20 festive ads from 2018. He settles on The Boy and the Piano, the offering from John Lewis that tells the life story of Elton John backwards, from megastardom to the gift of a piano from his parents as a child, accompanied by his timeless heartstring-puller Your Song. The ad was well received, but Jäätma is clearly unconvinced.He hits play, and the ad starts, but this time two lines – one grey (negative reactions), the other red (positive) – are traced across the action. These follow the second-by-second responses of a 200-person sample audience who watched the ad and allowed Realeyes to record them through the camera of their computer or smartphone. Realeyes then used its AI technology to analyse each inidual’s facial expression and body language. The company did this with all of Jäätma’s list of 20 Christmas ads from 2018, watching 4,000 people, before rating each commercial for attention, emotion, sentiment and finally giving it a mark out of 10.What is wrong with The Boy and the Piano, then? “So these are the metrics we measure: are you happy? Confused? Sad? Disgusted?” explains Jäätma, as the video plays. “If you look at the grey line, the negative emotions, you see that the UK audience is not that excited about the Elton John parts. The negativity goes up, people are tired about this promotion of the celebrity, they have had enough of this Elton John stuff.” Only when Elton as a child makes an appearance is there a spike of red. “Now when it goes into family and kids and it’s not the celebrity any more,” Jäätma goes on, “that’s where the positivity goes up.”Realeyes assigned the John Lewis commercial a score of 7.8 out of 10, placing it 12th out of the 20 Christmas ads they tested. It was rated fifth out of the retailer’s eight Christmas commercials since 2011. “So we concluded that this ad… the kid was the star,” says Jäätma. “It would have been better without Elton John almost. Or at least shorter.” The ad ran at 2min 20sec – “way too long. You can only put that on TV, no one’s going to watch that online.”This is clearly a big deal for John Lewis: their Christmas campaign is by far the most important of the year. But what difference does it make to us? Quite a lot, potentially, argues Jäätma. Realeyes was founded in 2007 with the goal of teaching computers how we feel. “There’s obviously this whole big debate about: is AI going to come and kill us or is it going to come and help us?” says Jäätma, an Estonian who started Realeyes with two friends while doing an MBA at the University of Oxford. “Right now, AI is like this big brain that is very intelligent and knows everything, but what we say is that it misses a heart. What we want to build into the AI is emotional understanding and consciousness. So the better we make it, the more likelihood that all this AI stuff will actually be good for humanity and not the other way around.”Jäätma and his partners – another Estonian, Martin Salo, and an Azerbaijani, Elnar Hajiyev, who work on the technical side – decided initially to focus on advertising because, they felt, it would be the quickest path to grow and make money. And, over a decade, they have created a database that they think is the richest and most sophisticated in the world. It is made up of 420m frames of people watching video on their devices (all have given their permission to be captured). These images are then labelled by seven different people, based on the American psychologist Paul Ekman’s list of basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise. Realeyes has gone to efforts to make the training algorithm culturally sensitive, by having Europeans tag Europeans or Asians annotate Asians, but for Jäätma, the beauty of Ekman’s theory, which dates from the early 1970s, is that the basic emotions are expressed the same way whether the subject is from Japan or Madagascar.Realeyes is doing well. It now has a staff of 78 – including scientists and engineers in Budapest, with smaller sales and customer support teams in London and New York – and clients that include Coca-Cola and Mars. It has raised nearly £30m from investors, including £9.5m in the latest round, much of it from NTT, the Japanese telecoms company. And while its focus at the moment is advertising and entertainment, its aspirations are clearly much greater: education and healthcare are on Jäätma’s list of “86 new projects” (he’s serious). In fact, Realeyes believes that it won’t be long before emotion AI is a feature of almost every area of our lives.“AI is going to be the next industrial revolution,” Jäätma predicts. “So it’s going to have a huge impact on all industries. And emotion AI is going to be a core part of all AI, so we want to be at the forefront of when that happens and to have the right impact on that as well.”“The right impact” is a pertinent phrase. There are obvious advantages to our machines being more sensitive to our needs. It should mean a better, more intuitive service, less time wasted. Also, probably a billion things we haven’t thought of yet. One of Jäätma’s dreams is that soon emotion AI will be able to alert us when, for example, we are experiencing depression and encourage us to seek help.“Even today we spend more time with our phone than with our mothers or any other family member, so they just know and see you more than anything else,” he says. “And the technology is also getting to a place where you can get these facial and vocal reactions, which can be very early cues if you are too stressed for too long. If you can pick those signals up early, you can do something about it.”But emotion AI raises concerns, too. Do we really want our emotions to be machine-readable? How can we know that this data will be used in a way that will benefit citizens? Would we be happy for our employers to profile us at work, and perhaps make judgments on our stress management and overall competence? What about insurance companies using data accrued on our bodies and emotional state?Prof Andrew McStay, author of Emotional AI: The Rise of Empathic Media, cautions against going down a “Black Mirror avenue”, referring to the sci-fi TV series created by Charlie Brooker. “It’s quite easy to do the dystopian stuff,” he says, “and I always urge: rather than saying it’s really good or really bad, it’s about specifics.”For McStay, though, emotion AI is dangerous when it affects “future life opportunities” and he is especially concerned about its impact on the workplace. “What we are talking about is 360-degree surveillance,” he says. “Who benefits from that? I certainly don’t think it’s the mass of people within an organisation, ie its workers. We have this suite of technologies but then we also have this suite of financial opportunities. And it’s whether these financial opportunities are a little bit too lucrative for people to be ethically minded. Follow the money, as it were.”McStay also worries about the adoption of Ekman’s basic emotions. A recent report in the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest was damning about the idea that it was possible to accurately interpret emotions simply by analysing a person’s face. One example: you might scowl when you’re angry, but also when you are concentrating or have a headache. “I think you should be very, very sceptical of the Ekman-based approach,” McStay warns. “From the point of view of ad testing, it doesn’t really matter too much because it’s not terribly important. But when you start thinking about it in the context of where life decisions are made about a person, I find that very problematic.”Dr Brent Mittelstadt, a philosopher specialising in data ethics at the University of Oxford’s Internet Institute, finds that he has come across “more troubling examples than positive ones” with regard to emotion AI. “What if emotion AI is used to evaluate the honesty of an inidual, or whether they pose a threat?” he says. “With regard to the former, I’m thinking of the iBorderCtrl system, currently in a pilot phase on the Hungarian, Greek and Latvian borders, which is used to evaluate whether an inidual is giving truthful responses to questions at immigration control. As the relative risk of an application goes up, so too should our demands for accuracy and transparency. In the case of iBorderCtrl, the problem is that iniduals deemed to be lying are not given their test results or information about the functionality and accuracy of the system. Without these, it is very difficult to contest the decision of an automated system.”Despite these concerns, emotion AI looks set to become part of our lives, whether we like it or not. In fact, it already is. If you stand near the Eros statue in Piccadilly Circus looking at the vast advertising screens across the road (AKA the Piccadilly Lights) you will be recorded by two cameras (above Gap) that are the property of Land Securities Group, or LandSec. “When they identify a face, the technology works out an approximate age, sex, mood( –based on whether they think you are frowning or laughing – and notes some characteristics such as whether you wear glasses or whether you have a beard,” LandSec’s website explains.Why do they do this? “Based on the information,” the website continues, “we can display advertising on Piccadilly Lights that the audience are more likely to find relevant and interesting. We can also measure whether people are interested in the advertising by understanding how long they are staring towards the camera.”There are also clear advantages to emotion AI being utilised in retail – and again, it already is. Cameras track you as you move through shops, they see how you react to different products or what you think of in-store advertising displays. Have you given your consent for this exchange? By entering the store, perhaps you have, tacitly. Realeyes did an experiment with Mothercare where it found that customers who were greeted at the door with a smile tended to spend more.McStay notes that emotion AI is now attracting the attention, and funding, of the technology giants. For a long time, it was mainly worked on by startups, largely he thinks because “the Amazons, the Facebooks, the Googles” were put off by “the creepiness factor”. That, however, has now changed: Apple bought the emotion AI startup Emotient in 2016, while Facebook is developing its own emotion-based products. In May, Amazon announced that it had improved its smart assistant Alexa by using AI to detect human emotion. How much we are “aware or in control of” sensitive information we are sharing in these contexts, Mittelstadt argues, is a deeply troubling grey area.“Most companies and organisations agree that we are going to see more of this stuff in the early 2020s,” says McStay. “I would guess around 2021, 2022. That sounds quite fanciful in a sense, but if you begin from the premise that there’s personal, economic and organisational value in understanding human emotion, then there’s a certain inevitability about these technologies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business with The Deaf Traveller, and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

A petition demanding that the HBO channel reshoot it from scratch has now been signed by more than a million viewers.But the creator, George RR Martin, has insisted that the furore over the television adaptation of his fantasy novels won’t change what he writes next.In a rare interview with the Observer which will be published on Sunday, Martin said that the TV show had not been “very good” for him, admitting that its end in May had been “freeing”. He still has two more novels of the fantasy saga to write, but insisted their endings would be unaffected by the controversy over the show’s ending.“No, it doesn’t. It doesn’t change anything at all … You can’t please everybody, so you’ve got to please yourself,” he said.Martin published A Game of Thrones in 1996, the first in a planned seven-volume series called A Song of Ice and Fire. It was adapted by HBO for broadcast in 2011. With the combined success of his books and the show across the world, Martin, 70, is estimated to be worth $65m (£54m). But, he said, his increasing fame had made writing difficult.Martin said he would “let fans have their theories” but that he now steered clear of the intense emotional response the show provoked online.Martin spoke fondly of interactions with fans of his books, but said he was unable to attend the GoT conventions as he once did.“I don’t want to go to a party where an unending succession of people want to take selfies with me,” he said. “Because that’s not fun the way it was in the old days. That’s work.”When asked if he missed the early days, the author was clear: “Yeah. Honestly I do. I mean, I can’t go into a bookstore any more, and that used to be my favourite thing to do in the world. To go in and wander from stack to stack, take down some books, read a little, leave with a big stack of things I’d never heard of when I came in. Now when I go to a bookstore, I get recognised within 10 minutes and there’s a crowd around me. So you gain a lot but you also lose things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0358f7c16e126263a1e1e96c8cf1602c726e0aa6/0_52_4892_2937/master/4892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24ecb4dce11697dec5fc143452cc9353","title":"our people are dying australias climate confrontation in the pacific","story":"Leaders at this week’s Pacific Islands Forum couldn’t disguise their anger over Canberra’s climate crisis ‘red lines’It was always going to be a showdown on the climate crisis.As leaders from the Pacific gathered in Tuvalu for their annual Pacific Islands Forum, there was one subject destined to dwarf all others and which pitted Australia, with its increasing emissions and plans for new coalmines, against its small island neighbours.And PIF 2019 turned out to be exactly that: a reckoning on the climate emergency confronting the Pacific.There were moving speeches from young Pasifika speaking of their fears for their future, tears in the leaders’ retreat, and accusations that Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, had shown such disrespect toward his counterparts during their marathon 12-hour meeting, that the Fijian prime minister said Pacific countries may be driven further into the arms of China.The choice of location for the forum was significant. Tuvalu, located about two hours on a plane north of Fiji, is one of the countries most at risk. The main island, where the capital, Funafuti, is located, is an ever-decreasing sliver of land, at its narrowest just 20m wide, and just 3m above sea level. It faces a host of problems including salinity of the water table, which makes growing crops extremely difficult, coastal erosion that is seeing islands crumble into the sea, storm surges and rising temperatures.To feed delegates, different communities from Tuvalu’s outer islands took turns preparing and bringing in food, presenting lavish lunches and dinners of crab, lobster, fish, chicken, salads, taro and custard coconut cake. On several nights, large traditional dances or fateles were held, with the different islands taking it in turn to run the night’s entertainment.Tuvalu’s prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, told the  ahead of the conference that Tuvalu was seeing the event as an opportunity to showcase its culture – to show the world what would be lost, apart from land, if Tuvalu were to disappear.From the opening speech of the climate crisis summit, delivered by Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, held the day before the forum officially opened, it was clear that Pacific leaders had their eyes on one forum member country in particular when it came to climate action.“I appeal to Australia to do everything possible to achieve a rapid transition from coal to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change,” he said, adding that coal posed an “existential threat” to Pacific countries.When Scott Morrison arrived on Wednesday afternoon, he was asked by Sopoaga, as all leaders were, to stop and consider the installation built at the entry to the airport – a model of an island in distress with a moat around it, in which young children sat.Groups of children sang a welcome song: “We have a problem, we need to solve it, we need to start right now.” Before singing a version of Sopoaga’s famous statement on climate change: “Save Tuvalu to save the world.”Morrison’s announcement of $500m in climate resilience and adaptation for the Pacific region on Monday night, while welcomed by Pacific leaders, did not buy Australia much of a reprieve. The next day, Sopoaga said: “No matter how much money you put on the table, it doesn’t give you the excuse to not to do the right thing, which is to cut down on your emissions, including not opening your coalmines.”The main event of the week, the leaders’ retreat, was held on Thursday, with leaders, in the customary matching shirts, sitting down to thrash out the language of a forum communique and climate change statement, that will be used as the basis of regional decision-making.At dawn on the morning of the retreat, as he stood watching an early-morning demonstration of traditional Tuvaluan fishing methods, Sopoaga said he was optimistic and thought negotiations would be wrapped up by lunchtime.Sopoaga said the fishing method was a good metaphor for what the leaders were trying to do that day: a group of people walk out into the water and advance in a line, slapping and waving palm branches underwater, to frighten the fish which are herded toward the reef and then eventually surrounded by the group who hold hands and advance, trapping them with their bodies before they are scooped up with nets. “You go in unison, you go like a human net. It’s a community thing, it’s a collective. I think that’s the way to address climate change. We must base it on a community approach,” Sopoaga said.But that community was sorely tested throughout Thursday, in a meeting between the leaders that Vanuatu’s foreign minister described as “fierce at times” and almost broke down twice, due to Australia’s refusal to budge on certain red lines, including insisting on the removal of mentions of coal, limiting warming to under 1.5C and setting a plan for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.Sopoaga said the next day he had told Morrison at one point during discussions: “You are trying to save your economy, I am trying to save my people.”Emotions ran high, with Sopoaga revealing that at one point during discussions, the Tongan prime minister, Akilisi Pohiva, cried as he reflected on a presentation given by two young women at the climate change summit earlier in the week about their fears for the future.Pohiva cut a dignified but heartrending figure throughout the week. He attended the summit despite serious health concerns, which he told the  meant this year’s PIF would likely be his last. His frailty was evident, but so too was his deep feeling for Tuvalu, with other leaders speaking of the enormous respect his presence, despite his illness, demonstrated for the region and its concerns.An exhausted Sopoaga eventually emerged from the retreat venue on Thursday night, after almost 12 hours of negotiations, and told the waiting press that an agreement had been reached on the forum communique and climate change statement.Australia had succeeded in watering down the language of the communique, and keeping out any mention of coal and its other “red lines”. But while Australia may have succeeded in softening the language, the means by which it achieved that victory seemed to undermine the government’s much-touted Pacific step-up, in which Canberra seeks to engage more concertedly with the region, particularly in light of China’s increasing interest in it.The Fijian prime minister expressed his anger with how events had unfolded in the leaders’ retreat, telling the  that Morrison had been “very insulting and condescending” and that his behaviour could lead countries to reject Australia in favour of engagement with China.“After what we went through with Morrison, nothing can be worse than him,” Bainimarama said.As the accommodation was packed up and the Australian defence force Hercules planes took delegates away, the people of Tuvalu remained, facing the same threats and dangers they did before leaders came to debate what to do about them.On the final night of the forum, a clearly disappointed Sopoaga urged Tuvaluans who were unhappy with the “compromised” language coming out of the event not to lose hope, and he urged the rest of the world to remember the plight of his people: “We ask, please understand this, our people are dying.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Artworks on light keeper and lighthouse used to mark 40 years since ill-fated racePractical, hands-on courses offer career progression and skills enhancement outside the traditional CAO systemTaoiseach foresees further work on retention of data, transparency and legal basis of PSCRespect for \u0026lsquoall the guys who didn\u0026rsquot make it and those still here suffering and injured\u0026rsquoRonan Scully embarks on latest Bay to Bay trek from Waterford to Galway this weekendDeveloper says reclaiming land near Clontarf would create homes for 65,000 peopleISPCA warns removing tails is illegal and weakens dog\u0026rsquos ability to communicate properlyGarda\u0026iacute say those travelling by road should leave plenty of time for journeysMaurice \u0026lsquoMossie\u0026rsquo Keane (79) suffered a stroke late last year and died on WednesdayRescue services called after man got into difficulty in Kilkee on Saturday morningMan in 50s dies in Clonmel after car crashes into pole woman in 60s dies in Thurles crashVictim in a critical condition in hospital after assault in Ballybough areaRomanticising the Troubles contributes to the risk of a return to violence, experts warnJust over a fifth of all stations are now open for 24 hours, analysis showsData Protection Commissioner\u0026rsquos report found documentation retention unlawfulChanges proposed will not fix traffic problems in the area, local councillor saysClaims made that two entrances to be used, one for elected members and one for staffLimerick non-profit calls on Government to ensure asylum seekers receive basic supportsThere are troubling parallels between conditions 50 years ago and the situation nowAugust 17th 1969: Drawing on contemporaneous reports, Donnacha \u0026Oacute Beach\u0026aacutein describes the day\u0026rsquos events as they unfolded"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3989751.1566063050!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"issues over public services card certainly require change varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at the Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann in  Drogheda, Co Louth, on Saturday. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Leo Varadkar has conceded there are “certainly issues that will need to be changed” in the wake of the controversy over the Public Services Card (PSC). There would have to be alterations involving such issues as retention of data and strengthening of the card’s basis in law, the Taoiseach said. In a damning report sent to the Department of Social Protection this week, the Data Protection Commission found there was no legal reason to make iniduals obtain the card in order to access State services. It was unlawful, the report also found, for the State to retain data gathered as part of the rollout of the card to 3.2 million citizens.Questioned during a weekend visit to the Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann in Drogheda, the Taoiseach said: “There will need to be some changes around the retention of data, transparency and strengthening the legal basis of the Public Services Card.”One of the issues the Government will soon address is the deletion of retained data on cardholders, he added.Response plannedThe Government would be examining the commission’s report in detail and planned to respond “as quickly as possible”.The Taoiseach also cautioned cardholders not to throw out their cards just yet. “Keep it, you’re still going to need it,” he said.The document would still be necessary as a form of identification for access to a number of public services, including pensions, benefits and treatments.Mr Varadkar said he believes the card has been successful in the fundamental purposes set out when it was first established. “The PSC was established a long time ago to help people access public services and crack down on fraud. It has been successful in that regard.‘A good project’“The PSC was around before I became minister for social protection, it continues to exist today and it will into the future,” he said. “It’s still a good project.”When asked whether he would like to see the card become a requirement for certain services, Mr Varadkar said that while that is not Government policy, “it’s something we’ll have to examine the legal basis for”.“So from the point of view of day-to-day experience of the public, it is not going to change very much – but there will be changes that we will have to make as a Government,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3988204.1565960800!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"n%C3%B3ra quoirin the unanswered questions","story":"Police in Malaysia have said Franco-Irish teenager Nóra Quoirin probably died of starvation and stress after spending a week in the jungle. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Vulnerable since the day she was born’: Nóra Quoirin. Photograph: Lucie Blackman TrustFamily handoutPA WireThe Quoirin family had planned to spend two weeks of August relaxing in Malaysia, and Nóra – “fun, funny and extremely loving” – was excited about the holiday. But the 15-year-old, who had special needs, was also “not like other teenagers… not independent”, they said.After she was found to be missing from the Dusun holiday resort, on Sunday, August 4th, shortly after their arrival, they explained: “Nóra can read like a young child, but she cannot write more than a few words. She has a good memory, but she cannot understand anything conceptual. She is unable to do maths, and so things like money are impossible to manage.”They added that Nóra’s balance was limited and that she struggled with co-ordination. “She has been to Asia, and many European countries before, and has never wandered off or got lost.Nóra Quoirin’s body was found on Tuesday, August 13th, by a group of hikers who had volunteered their help. It was the 10th day of the search for the schoolgirl.She was found unclothed, near a stream, in a hard-to-access hilly area that had already been covered by the search-and-rescue operation. The location is 2km from the resort the family had checked in to 11 days earlier. It is an area of dense jungle near the town of Seremban, about 60km from the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.Her body was flown to Seremban by helicopter. On Thursday, Malaysian police announced the results of a 10-hour postmortem and said there was no evidence of foul play. The chief of police in the state of Negeri Sembilan, Mohamad Mat Yusop, said: “The cause of death was upper-gastrointestinal bleeding due to a duodenal ulcer complicated with perforation.” There was no evidence that Nóra had been abducted or raped, he added.The bleeding in Nóra’s intestine could have been caused by prolonged hunger and stress, Mohamad said the pathologists dated Nóra’s death to two or three days before her body was found, and to no more than four days.The Quoirin family, who have lived in London for about 20 years, have said they will now bring her home, “where she will finally be laid to rest, close to her loving families in France and Ireland”.Their statement issued on Friday says: “The initial postmortem results have given some information that help us to understand Nóra’s cause of death. But our beautiful, innocent girl died in extremely complex circumstances, and we are hoping that soon we will have more answers to our many questions. We are still struggling to understand the events of the last 10 days.”The Lucie Blackman Trust, which has been helping the family, says that investigations in France will continue. It also urges an end to public speculation. “The police hotline remains open, and the family are still seeking any information from the public that can help to provide clarity on the events of the last 10 days.”A reward of 50,000 ringgit, or about €10,800, had been offered the day before Nóra’s body was found, donated by an anonymous Belfast-based business. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which was set up to support British nationals in crisis overseas, has confirmed that none of the reward has been paid in connection with the discovery of the teenager’s body.Dusun Eco Resort sits in a durian orchard in the foothills of the Titiwangsa Mountains, next to the 1,600-hectare, or 4,000-acre, Berembun Forest Reserve, which is home to sun bears, white-handed gibbons, macaques, wild pigs, panthers, tapirs and muntjac. Locals have seen leopard tracks. The resort has six guest houses on the top of a small hill.Many visitors scale Gunung Telapak Buruk, the highest mountain in the vicinity, and some seek out a site where a second World War plane crashed. Locals say many hikers get lost without a torch when night falls, having underestimated the time it takes to get to the crash site.Several questions remain about Nóra’s disappearance and death. Why would she have left the resort in the middle of the night? Did she climb out of the downstairs window that was found open when she disappeared and on which police found unidentified fingerprints?Why was her body found unclothed? If Nóra did walk off into the jungle, why could sniffer dogs pick up her scent only in the immediate vicinity of the guest house? Does this suggest she was abducted?Nóra’s body was found in an area that had already been covered by search-and-rescue teams, so how is it that they did not see her?The area where Nóra’s body was found had been covered until day seven of Nóra’s disappearance. Perhaps, Mohamad Mat Yusop said, Nóra was still moving around at that time. After day seven the search-and-rescue teams concentrated on the Gunung Berembun area.A Daily Mail reporter, Paul Thompson, interviewed Sean Yeap, one of the hikers who discovered Nóra’s body. Yeap told him that the body was not hidden or covered with foliage and said he would have expected search teams that had passed through the area previously to have found it, had it been there at the time.Although police say the bleeding in Nóra’s intestine was most likely caused by prolonged hunger and stress, stomach ulcers can be caused by Helicobacter pylori bacteria. Nóra might have drunk contaminated water, although this cannot be established.“It is not possible she would have willingly left with a stranger,” he said. “If she went out alone by mistake, she would have banged on the door and screamed to be let back in.”Pacôme Quoirin said the family did not question the information released by Malaysian police after the postmortem. “Her death was caused by a haemorrhage, as they said. But what were the conditions that led to it? The findings that were announced in no way discredit a criminal act. She could have been kidnapped and fed at the beginning. There is insufficient evidence to jump to definitive conclusions.”The Quoirins’ lawyer Sankara N Nair said on Wednesday that he would contact the Malaysian attorney general, Tommy Thomas, about holding an inquest into Nóra’s death if the postmortem provided evidence to support that course of action.On Thursday the Malay Mail quoted the Negeri Sembilan police chief as saying the Irish and French police who observed the postmortem were satisfied with the work of the team who had carried it out. The Irish authorities had not requested a second examination.The search for Nóra involved expert trackers from the Senoi Praaq special unit, made up mainly of members of the Orang Asli indigenous people, and members of the elite 69 Commando unit of the Royal Malaysian Police. Divers searched the river that runs through the forest, and helicopters and drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras were deployed.To aid in the search, a recording of Nóra’s mother’s voice was played via megaphones. Search teams also played the recording of Meabh Quoirin’s voice on their mobile phones as they went through the jungle.The Lucie Blackman Trust has been helping the family to deal with the media, and organised the printing of 10,000 flyers to be distributed in Kuala Lumpur and several Malaysian states, including Melaka and Johor.More than £104,000, or €114,000, has been raised by a GoFundMe appeal launched by Aisling Agnew, Nóra’s aunt, on behalf of Nóra’s family. Nearly €20,000 has been raised in a separate GoFundMe appeal set up by Pacôme Quoirin.Hundreds of people in Seremban prayed for Nóra during the Muslim festival of Hari Raya Aidiladha, as Malaysians call Eid ul-Fitr.The Dusun family and staff also expressed their condolences. “We are devastated by the turn of events, and we would like to extend our support and assistance in whatever way possible to the Quoirins during these very difficult times,” they said. A Dusun spokeswoman said on Friday that while investigations continued she could not respond to criticisms of the resort for having insufficient CCTV.There is much speculation about Nóra’s disappearance. It ranges from the cautious public statements by some members of the Quoirin family, gently probing aspects of the investigation, to the numerous theories – some fanciful – advanced on social media.Many Malaysians believe in spirits and there is even talk of her having being hidden by the Orang bunian, supernatural beings known as the hidden or whistling people, who are said to be invisible except to people with spiritual sight and are generally regarded as benevolent.The tragedy has had an impact both locally and internationally, but none have felt it so keenly as her family. After Nóra’s disappearance and the harrowing search for her, the Quoirins are having to deal not only with the results of the postmortem but also with the devastating loss of a girl her mother described as “precious” and “vulnerable since the day she was born”.Her family have many unanswered questions. Some may never be answered, but, as the investigation by Malaysian police continues, the hope is that at least the most important ones will be."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Jihadi Jack: Isis fighter stripped of British citizenship by Home OfficeJihadi Jack: The OCD teenager who took a football to bed with him who grew up to be a terroristJournalist Owen Jones attacked outside pub in \u0026#39premeditated assault by far-right\u0026#39Search for boy, six, who fell into River Stour during \u0026#39family trip\u0026#39Carrie Symonds will join Boris Johnson at Balmoral and become first PM\u0026#39s girlfriend to meet QueenSuicide-bomb rips through wedding blast in Kabul as dozens feared deadRaising pension age to 75 would create £182bn boost for British economy, report claimsCharity\u0026#39s links to Qatar raised fearsGCSE student disqualified after \u0026#39over zealous\u0026#39 examiner mistook vegetarianism for IslamophobiaAnimal rights activists secretly film badger cull companies in security meeting with policePig hearts \u0026#39could be used in human transplants within three years\u0026#39 after gene breakthrough Comment: I\u0026#39ll make sure our heroic police officers get the protection they deserveComment: Time for MPs to end the silly season and get seriously behind the PMAlok Sharma says EU officials are passing over British aid charities for fundingPriti Patel demands crackdown on criminals assaulting police officers as figures show jail term is just two monthsDowning Street slams \u0026#39dishonest\u0026#39 Tory rebels, as Boris Johnson triggers EU exit Record number of patients admitted to A\u0026ampE with malnutrition amid growing social care crisisRevealed: Full extent of Lord Mountbatten\u0026#39s role in \u0026#3968 plot against Harold WilsonPolice seize weapons as Portland braces for clashes between far-right and antifa protestersComment: Hong Kong is an island of freedom.

Of course, I agree we can’t go on like this. But I am 67, and I’m a relative of the Queen. This is a job for younger men. Perhaps there should be something like the Emergency Committee I ran in India.”Louis Mountbatten, Prince Charles and Princess Anne at a special preview of the television series The Life and Times of Lord Mountbatten in 1968, the year of the plot against Wilson\u0026#39s governmentOn May 8 that year Mountbatten hosted King, Cudlipp and Sir Solly Zuckerman, the scientist and senior government advisor, at his Belgravia home in Kinnerton St, to discuss what to do about the Wilson government.According to Cudlipp, Zuckerman expressed deep reservations about a possible coup, stating “This is rank treachery. All this talk of machine guns at street corners is appalling.”Mountbatten appeared to some of those present to concur with Zuckerman and wrote of the meeting in his diary that evening: “Dangerous nonsense.” Furthermore he stated in a letter to King in July 1970 that “my views are unaltered” and repeated Zuckerman’s warning that to remove Wilson was “rank treachery”.However, the mystery of the aborted plot to remove Labour from power deepened when King later released his diary entry for the May 1968 meeting, which according to Mr Lownie’s book The Mountbattens, “gave a rather different account” of what was said.King wrote that after Zuckerman left the meeting Mountbatten told him “morale in the armed forces had never been so low” and that the Queen “is desperately worried over the whole situation”.According to King, Mountbatten “asked if I thought there was anything he should do”.The book now reveals that in November 1975 Zuckerman - in what appears to be an attempt to set the historical record straight - added a crucial diary note to his own file on the May ‘68 meeting.Mr Lownie says in his book: “It was beginning to emerge that Mountbatten had shown far more interest than he, or the others, had earlier admitted.”According to Cudlipp, Mountbatten had even compiled a list of names for a possible national government, including industrialists, senior military figures and civil servants, as well as ‘moderate’ Labour politicians.Cecil King addressing the annual meeting of the publishing giant IPC Certainly Marcia Williams, Harold Wilson’s secretary and later Baroness Falkender, took the threat of a plot seriously, talking of Mountbatten “as a prime mover in the plan”.In a conversation with members of the press following Wilson’s surprise resignation in March 1976, Baroness Falkender said: “Mountbatten had a map on the wall of his office showing how it could be done. Harold and I used to stand in the State Room at Number 10 and work out where they would put the guns.”In the end what appears to have held Mountbatten back from supporting, or even leading, a coup was not any loyalty he may have felt to British Parliamentary democracy, but the influence of the Crown.Mr Lownie cites Alex von Tunzelmann, the historian and scriptwriter, who - drawing on private information from Buckingham Palace - states: “It was not Solly Zuckerman who talked Mountbatten out of staging a coup and making himself President of Britain. It was the Queen herself.”Even before the Belgravia meeting it was clear Lord Mountbatten had long nurtured political ambitions at the highest level.During a long conversation with Sir Solly Zuckerman in June 1946, while he was in Oxford to receive an honorary degree, Mountbatten - who had been Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asian during WWII before being appointed the last Viceroy of India - discussed what his post-war role might be.He even suggested that he should by rights have been able to take the top job itself.First Sea Lord Louis Mountbatten, Earl Mountbatten, at his office in the Admiralty, in 1955Zuckerman later wrote in his memoirs: “The one job that he felt that he could have done was that of Prime Minister, but that office had been closed down to him because of his royal connections. He talked as if there was nothing he could not do.”The following year Orme Sargent, the then Permanent Under-secretary at the Foreign Office, confided his fears about Mountbatten’s dictatorial ambitions to the journalist Robert Bruce Lockhart.Further evidence of Mountbatten’s political aspirations emerged a few years later.In his book Six Men Out of the Ordinary, Zuckerman writes how in 1951, at a cocktail party at Admiralty House, Mountbatten, who was killed when the IRA blew up his yacht in 1979, began to bemoan “the sorry state of the country”.The Mountbattens by Andrew LownieThe Mountbattens – Their Lives And Loves by Andrew Lownie (Blink Publishing) is out 22nd August. Visit http:www.themountbattensThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Pick incorrectly and it could derail the whole enterprise.Find the right person, though – someone with the right blend of confidence, naivety and unselfconsciousness – and the results can be breathtaking.This week sees Jacob Tremblay continue his run of impressive roles with Good Boys, which follows three sixth grade boys who ditch school and embark on an epic journey while carrying accidentally stolen drugs. Before that, he starred in the 2015 drama Room, giving a performance that was as deserving of an Oscar as his co-star Brie Larson, who took home Best Actress. And he’s still only 12.In celebration, we\u0027ve counted down the 18 most memorable performances by children in cinema. Click through the gallery below to see who made the cut.Created with Sketch.18 best child performances in film history Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.118 Christina Ricci in The Addams Family (1991)In the 27 years since she was transferred to the big screen via Christina Ricci, Wednesday Addams has become less a character and more a mood, a religion and a lifestyle. Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel. (AW)218 Saoirse Ronan in Atonement (2007)Since Atonement, Ronan has become one of the most accomplished actors of her generation. And it’s no surprise, given how convincingly she brought to life, at the age of 13, Ian McEwan’s precocious and stubborn protagonist Briony Tallis, whose misinterpretation of a romantic encounter between her sister and her childhood friend wreaks havoc in the lives of those around her. (EH)318 Quvenzhané Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012)Quvenzhané Wallis is proof that lying sometimes gets you places. As a five-year-old, the child star convinced her parents to let her fib about her age so that she could audition for Beasts of the Southern Wild – their minimum age was six. So impressed was director Benh Zeitlin by Wallis that he changed his entire script so that the character of Hushpuppy matched her stubborn personality. At the age of nine, she became the youngest Best Actress nominee in Oscars history. (JS)418 Aleksei Kravchenko in Come and See (1985)Horrific war film Come and See – which depicts Nazism through a child’s eyes – is a nightmarish but essential experience, if only to witness the performance of Aleksei Kravchenko. It would have been tough for an actor of any age to film the scenes asked of him by director Elem Klimov let alone a 14-year old one, but Kravchenko commits so nobly it’s hard to tear your eyes from the screen. He found the shoot so troubling that he reportedly developed grey hair. (JS)518 Jean-Pierre Léaud in The 400 Blows (1959)Jean-Pierre Léaud was one of several hundred boys who François Truffaut auditioned for The 400 Blows and it’s easy to see why he won the role. In Truffaut, Léaud found a mentor –  he took control of the 15-year-old\u0027s upbringing when shooting ended after he was expelled from school and kicked out of his carers’ home – and Léaud would return as the character five more times. (JS)618 Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone (1990)Considering he starts Home Alone as an obnoxious “little jerk”, it’s a testament to Macaulay Culkin’s skill that Kevin McCallister manages to worm his way into viewers’ hearts . Culkin has insane amounts of fun ruling the roost when his family accidentally forget to bring him on their Christmas holiday, and it never fails to be a gleeful experience watching Kevin runs rings around bumbling burglars Harry (Daniel Stern) and Marv (Joe Pesci). (JS)718 Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine (2006)Breslin became one of the youngest Oscar nominees of all time when she received a nod for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, aged 10, as Olive Hoover in the beloved 2006 road movie. She played an underdog youngster on a mission to win a beauty contest, accompanied by her quirky and dysfunctional family, with real wit and flair. (EH)818 Alex Hibbert in Moonlight (2016)Giving a performance in perfect symmetry to the film around him, Alex Hibbert is one of a number of brilliantly subtle actors in Moonlight. Only on screen for the film’s first third, he mostly inhabits a quiet and devastating yearning, embodying a character buried under the emotional weight of playground bullying and constant domestic upheaval, and desperate for someone to show him compassion and answer his questions. If Hollywood has any sense, Moonlight will be just the first of many incredible opportunities for the young star. (AW)918 Mara Wilson in Mrs Doubtfire (1993)Mara Wilson is one of those great child star success stories, immortalised in at least three classic movies while still in single-digits, retiring early, and now writing, podcasting and saying smart, funny things on Twitter. But while 1996’s Matilda is often talked about as her best work, she was somehow even more brilliant in Mrs Doubtfire three years earlier, where she is adorable and grouchy and seems to possess a beautifully sincere, if today bittersweet, joy over merely being in Robin Williams’s company. (AW)1018 Isabelle Fuhrman in Orphan (2009)Isabelle Fuhrman is scarily convincing in her role as Esther, the sickly-sweet orphan girl turned murderous dwarf asylum escapee. The sexual and violent nature of some scenes may be uncomfortable to watch, but there is no denying Fuhrman executes them perfectly. (MH)1118 Tatum O’Neal in Paper Moon (1973)Tatum O’Neal was, and still is, the youngest person to ever win an Oscar for her role as the sassy, smoking, swindling tomboy Addie in Paper Moon. Addie may or may not be the daughter of con man Moses, who is reluctantly saddled with the youngster before realising she can help him with his scams. Moses is played by O’Neal’s real-life father Ryan O’Neal, and there’s just no faking that kind of chemistry. (AP)1218 Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap (1998)Lohan was just 12 when she played identical twins Annie and Hallie in the 1998 classic. While the sisters were of course impossible to distinguish by their looks, their personalities and backgrounds could hardly have been more different: one was a well-to-do Londoner, the other a boisterous American tomboy. The young star impressed audiences with her ability to switch effortlessly and convincingly between the two. (EH)1318 Heather O’Rourke in Poltergeist (1982)Heather O’Rourke tragically died aged just 12 in 1988, but she will long be remembered as the ethereal blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Cast after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg, she captivates the audience as a little girl who can communicate with “the other side” through the family television set. (MH)1418 Jacob Tremblay in Room (2015)Egregiously overlooked for an Oscar in 2016, Jacob Tremblay\u0027s performance in Room will pull out heartstrings you never knew you had. As Jack, a long-haired five-year-old who has been imprisoned in a garden shed all his life and is oblivious to the outside world, he not only raises the film\u0027s cute quotient, but also brings surprising depth. His is a turn of great maturity, one that scratches away at the fact that Jack has never had any male interaction. Brie Larson, who plays his mum, did win an Oscar for her role here. (PS)1518 Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999)Haley Joel Osment’s performance as Cole Sear, a young boy tormented by his ability to see and talk to the dead, is so strong that he remains the most memorable part of the M Night Shyamalan film, despite a career-best turn from Bruce Willis and one of the most effective twists in cinema history. (JS)1618 River Phoenix in Stand by Me (1986)One of the few comforts to cling onto when thinking of River Phoenix’s tragic death aged 23 is that he was at least able to showcase his vast acting range before he died. The actor, whose brother is Joaquin Phoenix, played everything from tortured teenagers to tough adventurers and street hustlers. But perhaps his finest work came early, in 1986’s Stand by Me, when he played a sensitive pre-teen who masks insecurity and self-loathing beneath a veneer of macho posturing. It’s a staggering bit of acting from someone so young. (AW)1718 Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit (2010)It’s probably not true to say that Hailee Steinfeld is the only person who could have pulled off the role of the fearless Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers’ adaptation of Charles Portis novel True Grit – but from the moment she arrives in Fort Smith with plans to hunt down her father’s killer, she makes you feel like she is. How she didn\u0027t win Best Supporting Actress at the 2011 Oscars will remain a mystery. (JS)1818 Heather Matarazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)Generally speaking, children acting in Todd Solondz movies need to have nerves of steel and far more self-confidence than average youngsters. But it takes a child of unusual gutsiness to enact the horrors inflicted upon poor Dawn Wiener in his 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse. A yearning, eager loner played to perfection by Heather Matarazzo, Dawn is the recipient of a level of casual cruelty that would feel fetishistic if it weren\u0027t so tragically true to life. When she was killed off before the credits in Solondz’s 2004 film Palindromes, the collective mourning it inspired in his fanbase was only a result of how powerfully Matarazzo’s performance lingered. (AW)118 Christina Ricci in The Addams Family (1991)In the 27 years since she was transferred to the big screen via Christina Ricci, Wednesday Addams has become less a character and more a mood, a religion and a lifestyle. Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel. (AW)218 Saoirse Ronan in Atonement (2007)Since Atonement, Ronan has become one of the most accomplished actors of her generation.

Culkin has insane amounts of fun ruling the roost when his family accidentally forget to bring him on their Christmas holiday, and it never fails to be a gleeful experience watching Kevin runs rings around bumbling burglars Harry (Daniel Stern) and Marv (Joe Pesci). (JS)718 Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine (2006)Breslin became one of the youngest Oscar nominees of all time when she received a nod for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, aged 10, as Olive Hoover in the beloved 2006 road movie. She played an underdog youngster on a mission to win a beauty contest, accompanied by her quirky and dysfunctional family, with real wit and flair. (EH)818 Alex Hibbert in Moonlight (2016)Giving a performance in perfect symmetry to the film around him, Alex Hibbert is one of a number of brilliantly subtle actors in Moonlight. Only on screen for the film’s first third, he mostly inhabits a quiet and devastating yearning, embodying a character buried under the emotional weight of playground bullying and constant domestic upheaval, and desperate for someone to show him compassion and answer his questions. If Hollywood has any sense, Moonlight will be just the first of many incredible opportunities for the young star. (AW)918 Mara Wilson in Mrs Doubtfire (1993)Mara Wilson is one of those great child star success stories, immortalised in at least three classic movies while still in single-digits, retiring early, and now writing, podcasting and saying smart, funny things on Twitter. But while 1996’s Matilda is often talked about as her best work, she was somehow even more brilliant in Mrs Doubtfire three years earlier, where she is adorable and grouchy and seems to possess a beautifully sincere, if today bittersweet, joy over merely being in Robin Williams’s company. (AW)1018 Isabelle Fuhrman in Orphan (2009)Isabelle Fuhrman is scarily convincing in her role as Esther, the sickly-sweet orphan girl turned murderous dwarf asylum escapee. The sexual and violent nature of some scenes may be uncomfortable to watch, but there is no denying Fuhrman executes them perfectly. (MH)1118 Tatum O’Neal in Paper Moon (1973)Tatum O’Neal was, and still is, the youngest person to ever win an Oscar for her role as the sassy, smoking, swindling tomboy Addie in Paper Moon. Addie may or may not be the daughter of con man Moses, who is reluctantly saddled with the youngster before realising she can help him with his scams. Moses is played by O’Neal’s real-life father Ryan O’Neal, and there’s just no faking that kind of chemistry. (AP)1218 Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap (1998)Lohan was just 12 when she played identical twins Annie and Hallie in the 1998 classic. While the sisters were of course impossible to distinguish by their looks, their personalities and backgrounds could hardly have been more different: one was a well-to-do Londoner, the other a boisterous American tomboy. The young star impressed audiences with her ability to switch effortlessly and convincingly between the two. (EH)1318 Heather O’Rourke in Poltergeist (1982)Heather O’Rourke tragically died aged just 12 in 1988, but she will long be remembered as the ethereal blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Cast after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg, she captivates the audience as a little girl who can communicate with “the other side” through the family television set. (MH)1418 Jacob Tremblay in Room (2015)Egregiously overlooked for an Oscar in 2016, Jacob Tremblay\u0027s performance in Room will pull out heartstrings you never knew you had. As Jack, a long-haired five-year-old who has been imprisoned in a garden shed all his life and is oblivious to the outside world, he not only raises the film\u0027s cute quotient, but also brings surprising depth. His is a turn of great maturity, one that scratches away at the fact that Jack has never had any male interaction. Brie Larson, who plays his mum, did win an Oscar for her role here. (PS)1518 Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999)Haley Joel Osment’s performance as Cole Sear, a young boy tormented by his ability to see and talk to the dead, is so strong that he remains the most memorable part of the M Night Shyamalan film, despite a career-best turn from Bruce Willis and one of the most effective twists in cinema history. (JS)1618 River Phoenix in Stand by Me (1986)One of the few comforts to cling onto when thinking of River Phoenix’s tragic death aged 23 is that he was at least able to showcase his vast acting range before he died. The actor, whose brother is Joaquin Phoenix, played everything from tortured teenagers to tough adventurers and street hustlers. But perhaps his finest work came early, in 1986’s Stand by Me, when he played a sensitive pre-teen who masks insecurity and self-loathing beneath a veneer of macho posturing. It’s a staggering bit of acting from someone so young. (AW)1718 Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit (2010)It’s probably not true to say that Hailee Steinfeld is the only person who could have pulled off the role of the fearless Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers’ adaptation of Charles Portis novel True Grit – but from the moment she arrives in Fort Smith with plans to hunt down her father’s killer, she makes you feel like she is. How she didn\u0027t win Best Supporting Actress at the 2011 Oscars will remain a mystery. (JS)1818 Heather Matarazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)Generally speaking, children acting in Todd Solondz movies need to have nerves of steel and far more self-confidence than average youngsters. But it takes a child of unusual gutsiness to enact the horrors inflicted upon poor Dawn Wiener in his 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse. A yearning, eager loner played to perfection by Heather Matarazzo, Dawn is the recipient of a level of casual cruelty that would feel fetishistic if it weren\u0027t so tragically true to life. When she was killed off before the credits in Solondz’s 2004 film Palindromes, the collective mourning it inspired in his fanbase was only a result of how powerfully Matarazzo’s performance lingered.

But, all the same, he has a strong case. “Do you know what percentage of people live in Asia?” he asked. I guessed around 50 per cent. It turns out to be 60 per cent. 4 billion people in Asia. A mere 700 million in Europe. QED.\u0026nbspNivern, now 37, is a posterboy for the utility of studying modern languages. At 14 he went on a school exchange to Paris. Brought up in Manchester, he found himself living across the street from the Louvre. At 17 he got a summer job in a factory outside Paris, packing cakes in boxes, where he was known as “Anglais”. “I was impressed that, even in the industrial zone, they still stopped for a proper lunch with a baguette and a bottle of wine.”This was the summer of 1998, the year of the Mondial in France. He tried – and failed – to get into the World Cup final at the Stade de France, but watched France beat Brazil 3-0 on a screen outside and saw the whole city go mad. “I couldn’t get home and I couldn’t get to work the next day either.” He went on to take French and German at Keble College, Oxford, specialising in 17th century French theatre. “Learning languages opens up your eyes to other parts of the world,” he says. “I just wanted to keep on going.”\u0026nbspWhich explains why, a couple of months after graduating, he took a job teaching English in a high school in a town, Hengshui (“not scenic, but with wonderful people”), three hours south of Beijing. With practically no knowledge of Chinese. He just threw himself in at the deep end and found he could float. When he got back to England he switched to international management and Chinese for his masters at Soas (the School of Oriental and African Studies), London. \u0026nbspNivern joined forces with fellow student Ed Holroyd Pearce (who had studied Oriental languages at Cambridge) to set up not just one but two companies, China Recruitment and China Consulting. “The simple idea was to make it easier for people to do what we did.” Those two eventually fused into one, CRCC Asia. They arrange the jobs (across a range of sectors), travel, accommodation and visas, and do all the networking for you. From small beginnings in Nivern’s kitchen in 2006, they now have a team of 50 working out of offices across Asia, collaborating with companies large and small. Nivern is based in Philadelphia, where he has set up partnerships with American universities like Texas and Michigan. And they are now expanding into South Korea, Japan and Vietnam. \u0026nbspI would love to say I get it right all the time. But the Chinese are incredibly receptive to foreigners trying to speak ChineseThis year they expect to send some 1,500 college students and graduates (generally between 18 and 23) to internships in Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, Ho Chi Minh City and… Manchester (it works in reverse too). Forty per cent\u0026nbspwill come from the UK, 40 per cent\u0026nbspfrom the US, and others from New Zealand and Australia. And CRCC Asia are providing a number of scholarships to support people can’t afford to self-finance. There is funding for 250 places\u0026nbspby the British Council. Globalism – combined with Brexit – is persuading a lot of young people to look east in search of work experience and an enhanced CV.\u0026nbspNivern picked up the Mandarin language relatively late. “I would love to say I get it right all the time. But the Chinese are incredibly receptive to foreigners trying to speak Chinese.” He reckons that the grammar is not as difficult as German, “what’s tricky is the tonality.” The same syllable, “Ma”, can mean either “mother” or “horse” (and a few other things), depending. “Hopefully the context helps,” says Nivern. A sentence involving a mother riding a horse is a well-known tongue twister. Most people, like Nivern himself, go to China with no Chinese, “but we encourage everyone to try – it makes a huge difference”.\u0026nbspChina bans actors and films from Asian awards ceremony in TaiwanChina warns Hong Kong protesters as police amass near borderAsian stocks fall as China hits back at US claim of yuan manipulationNivern says that China is like an onion: “You can go on peeling off layers. You think you know it but you don’t.” In CRCC Asia’s “Career Bridge” programme (which gives you training in “intercultural fluency”), one of the key concepts they try to get across to those new to China is mianzi or “face”. You can give face and you can lose face. Nobody wants to lose it. You have to be sensitive to hierarchy in China. If you’re arranging a dinner party, you put the least senior person closest to the door. Conversation should be addressed to the most senior person (like a government official) to begin with. If there is a toast, you can clink glasses, but you have to make sure the rim of your glass is lower than the local bigwig’s glass, otherwise you risk giving offence. By going lower you are giving face. “There’s sometimes a battle as to who goes lower,” says Nivern. “You can end up on the floor.”\u0026nbspJust as Nivern was inspired by the 1998 World Cup, so too, 10 years later, the Beijing Olympics of 2008 gave CRCC Asia a significant boost. The Chinese government took the games seriously enough to close factories and pull vehicles off the road with a view to cutting pollution. “It was all perfectly choreographed. You could say regimented. The closing ceremony was fantastic too.”\u0026nbspApparently the thing that shocked his Chinese friends most was the sight of then mayor of London, Boris Johnson, leading our 2012 handover, looking scruffy, with his jacket unbuttoned, one hand in his pocket, and his shirt hanging half out. He showed a lack of respect and lost a lot of face that day. “But at least I managed to get into the stadium this time,” said Nivern. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Non-store retailing, which covers mostly online sales, jumped 6.9 per cent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCompared with July 2018, overall sales grew 3.3 per cent, again boosted by online shopping. This was a smaller rise than in June but above economists’ expectations. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHowever, on the three-month measure, which strips out some of the volatility in the figures, sales ticked up only by 0.5 per cent from the February-April period. This was the slowest pace of growth since the end of last year.\u0026nbspDuncan Brewer, retail and consumer partner at Oliver Wyman, says there were two main drivers behind July’s retail sales: a record-breaking heatwave that kept shoppers away from bricks-and-mortar shops and heavy discounting online.\u0026nbspHe says:\u0026nbsp“Our research shows that 75 per cent of purchases during heavy discounting periods cannibalise full-price sales, as UK shoppers look to buy planned purchases rather than new, spontaneous products.”\u0026nbsp“Looking ahead, Brexit will be a major factor in consumer spending behaviour regardless of discounting. Shoppers will likely buy their Christmas shopping ahead of the 31 October deadline to avoid higher prices due to increased tariffs in the case of a no-deal Brexit.”Unlike farmers, British consumers seem to have been able to shrug off Brexit uncertainty, so far at least.\u0026nbspRanko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on today\u0027s UK retail sales data:\u0026nbspIt would seem UK consumers still don’t give a fig about Brexit, and remain more than willing to spend their real wage increases. \u0026nbspThe report bodes well for a likely growth bump in Q3, as there are few signs that consumers are growing anywhere near as wary of no-deal as businesses.One argument for chlorinated poultry is that it is cheaper.\u0026nbspZippy Duvall of the\u0026nbspAmerican Farm Bureau told the BBC that the UK public should have the right to buy cheaper US produce if they wanted to.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspA lot of our farmers don\u0027t understand why other countries implement tariffs on our products but then they don\u0027t want us to implement any tariffs on our end, so we need to level that playing field, tear down all those barriers and let our people be able to make the choice of what food they want to eat and where it\u0027s grown at.Is US chicken really cheaper?\u0026nbspUsing US government data from 2015, a report\u0026nbspfrom free-market think tank, The Adam Smith Institute,\u0026nbspcalculated\u0026nbspthat US consumers pay 21 per cent less for a kilogram\u0026nbspof chicken than their counterparts in the UK.The think tank has therefore advocated negotiating a trade deal that would allow for imports of chlorine-treated meat. The ASI report does not provide evidence demonstrating a causal link between chlorine washing and cheaper poultry prices in supermarkets. Other factors could also be at play.\u0026nbspWho funds the Adam Smith Institute?

Washing chicken carcasses in chlorinated water to kill off harmful bacteria is banned in the EU. And unlike the US, the EU has also not approved any fresh genetically modified (GM) fruit or vegetables for human consumption.But Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said concerns over the practices are not “science-based”.“There is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash, just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away,” Mr Duvall, a poultry farmer in Georgia, told BBC Radio 4.“If there was something wrong with it, our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Created with Sketch.The exercise it takes to burn off high-calorie foods Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 calories310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 caloriesBoth the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the British Poultry Council have said eating meat treated in that way is safe.However, the EFSA opposes chlorine rinsing because it enables farmers to lower their standards of animal welfare and hygiene as they can simply use a chemical bath to kill off any harmful pathogens after animals are slaughtered.The EU takes what it calls an integrated approach to food safety, “from farm to fork covering all sectors of the food chain”. As part of that approach, there are minimum legal requirements for the amount of space, lighting and ventilation in EU poultry-rearing houses.As there are no laws governing this in the US, the birds can be crammed in tightly, according to Simon Dawson, a food safety expert at Cardiff politan University. This reduces production costs but increases the risks of disease and contamination in a flock.“Some US abattoirs and processing plants rely heavily on chlorination because their other hygiene standards are so poor that they would be illegal in Europe,” Mr Dawson wrote in 2017.“The process is also very good at removing odours and surface slime, meaning the meat can be passed off as fresh for much longer than it should be.”The EU is less strict on GM food, allowing some such products to be sold provided the EFSA has deemed them safe and they are labelled as GM.The World Health Organisation says it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM crops, and that each food should be assessed separately.Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s national security adviser said the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal with the US after Brexit.John Bolton suggested that the US could focus on striking bilateral trade deals in certain sectors like manufacturing and car-making and work out more complicated areas later.According to Mr Duvall, though, any trade agreement would have to include agriculture.“To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that’s where a big part of our population lives,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “Any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies.\u0026nbsp“We have been clear on numerous occasions that we will not compromise on our high food or animal welfare standards as part of any trade deals.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

due in no small part to the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit and amplified by the impact of weather and tracking against national sporting events in the same period last year.As a result our non-food business has been challenged during the period, however we\u0027re satisfied that our food business has continued to perform well and our online growth continues to outpace the market.Despite all this, Asda\u0027s\u0026nbsptotal sales were up 1.3 per cent\u0026nbspIn the three months to 30 June.Good morning and welcome to The Independent\u0027s coverage of today\u0027s business and economic events.\u0026nbspMore than half of farms will go bust if\u0026nbspBoris Johnson\u0026nbspforces through a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit,\u0026nbspfarmers\u0026nbspare warning, as some join the campaign for a fresh referendum.A deadly cocktail of immediate\u0026nbsptariffs, border checks, increased red tape and cheaper food imports from outside the EU will result in the “decimation of UK farming”, a detailed study finds.Read the full story here from our deputy political editor Rob Merrick:Brexit: Farmers call for fresh referendum as they warn half of farms will go bust after no-deal exit\u0026nbspThe UK has been told by the American farming lobby that it must accept US standards such as allowing chlorinated chicken and the sale of genetically modified crops as part of a post-Brexit trade deal.\u0026nbspZippy Duval, head of the American Farm Bureau, told the BBC\u0026nbspthat fears about US practices were not science-based.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspYou know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine, Mr Duvall told the BBC\u0027s Today programme.So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away.If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that, he added.The US has already laid out what it is looking for from a trade deal with the UK:\u0026nbsphttps:ustr.govsitesdefaultfilesSummary_of_U.S.-UK_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf\u0026nbspIt specifically does not like EU measures it deems to be not science-based.\u0026nbspIn trade speak:\u0026nbspObtain commitment that the UK will not foreclose export opportunities to the United States with respect to third-country export markets, including by requiring third countries to align with non-science based restrictions and requirements or to adopt SPS measures that are not based on ascertainable risk.\u0026nbspSPS measures  food hygiene standards\u0026nbspWorth noting that while US farmers may not believe a ban on chlorinated chicken is science-based, there are far more cases of salmonella per person in the US than in the UK.\u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit could force more than half of British farms out of business, farmers are warning.\u0026nbspWhy?\u0026nbsp* The EU, plus third countries with which it has trade agreements, would immediately slap tariffs on food exports from the UK.*\u0026nbspTariff-free imports of many agricultural products\u0026nbspwould have to be offered to non-EU countries as well, including the USA, Brazil and Australia – undermining domestic farming* It would also be hit by new non-tariff barriers, including administrative costs and border checks to ensure compliance with EU food safety and animal health regulations.* It would face an effective trade embargo on exports of animal-based products, while the UK and the EU negotiated an agreement.* The removal of support payments – with only a proportion likely to be covered by Whitehall – and an adverse trading environment will “render the majority of farm businesses unviable”.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the competition watchdog has called for the break-up of two recently-merged medical technology firms after finding the deal could lead to the NHS and charities paying higher prices.Sweden-based Tobii bought UK rival Smartbox for £11m last year, but the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has now ordered Tobii to sell off the business.The announcement comes after an investigation by independent CMA panel members concluded that the tie-up could result in a reduction in quality, less new product development, and higher prices.\u0026nbspPress AssociationIn the markets, the FTSE 100 has opened up 0.5\u0026nbspper cent down at 7,115.53.\u0026nbspTobacco companies are the biggest climbers, RBS and B\u0026ampQ owner Kingfisher are the worst performers.\u0026nbspEuropean stocks are stabilising after fears of a recession sparked a sell-off yesterday.UK retail sales grew in July, lifted by a surge in online sales, according to official data.\u0026nbspThe quantity bought last month rose 0.2 per cent compared with June, defying economists’ forecasts for a 0.2 per cent drop. Non-store retailing, which covers mostly online sales, jumped 6.9 per cent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCompared with July 2018, overall sales grew 3.3 per cent, again boosted by online shopping. This was a smaller rise than in June but above economists’ expectations. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHowever, on the three-month measure, which strips out some of the volatility in the figures, sales ticked up only by 0.5 per cent from the February-April period. This was the slowest pace of growth since the end of last year.\u0026nbspDuncan Brewer, retail and consumer partner at Oliver Wyman, says there were two main drivers behind July’s retail sales: a record-breaking heatwave that kept shoppers away from bricks-and-mortar shops and heavy discounting online.\u0026nbspHe says:\u0026nbsp“Our research shows that 75 per cent of purchases during heavy discounting periods cannibalise full-price sales, as UK shoppers look to buy planned purchases rather than new, spontaneous products.”\u0026nbsp“Looking ahead, Brexit will be a major factor in consumer spending behaviour regardless of discounting. Shoppers will likely buy their Christmas shopping ahead of the 31 October deadline to avoid higher prices due to increased tariffs in the case of a no-deal Brexit.”Unlike farmers, British consumers seem to have been able to shrug off Brexit uncertainty, so far at least.\u0026nbspRanko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on today\u0027s UK retail sales data:\u0026nbspIt would seem UK consumers still don’t give a fig about Brexit, and remain more than willing to spend their real wage increases. \u0026nbspThe report bodes well for a likely growth bump in Q3, as there are few signs that consumers are growing anywhere near as wary of no-deal as businesses.One argument for chlorinated poultry is that it is cheaper.\u0026nbspZippy Duvall of the\u0026nbspAmerican Farm Bureau told the BBC that the UK public should have the right to buy cheaper US produce if they wanted to.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspA lot of our farmers don\u0027t understand why other countries implement tariffs on our products but then they don\u0027t want us to implement any tariffs on our end, so we need to level that playing field, tear down all those barriers and let our people be able to make the choice of what food they want to eat and where it\u0027s grown at.Is US chicken really cheaper?\u0026nbspUsing US government data from 2015, a report\u0026nbspfrom free-market think tank, The Adam Smith Institute,\u0026nbspcalculated\u0026nbspthat US consumers pay 21 per cent less for a kilogram\u0026nbspof chicken than their counterparts in the UK.The think tank has therefore advocated negotiating a trade deal that would allow for imports of chlorine-treated meat. The ASI report does not provide evidence demonstrating a causal link between chlorine washing and cheaper poultry prices in supermarkets. Other factors could also be at play.\u0026nbspWho funds the Adam Smith Institute? No one knows because they won\u0027t tell anyone.TSB has apologised yet again after more problems with its online banking and mobile app.\u0026nbspCustomers would not get into their accounts between 4am and 7am on Thursday morning after problems with routine maintenance.\u0026nbspTSB\u0027s suffered a disastrous IT meldown last year which caused many people to lose access to online banking services.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn\u0027s plan to bring down Boris Johnson with a no-confidence vote is boosting the pound.\u0026nbspSterling is up 0.64 per cent against the dollar to $1.2136\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspand 0.5 per cent against the euro to €1.088 so far.\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspsays it will attempt to bring down\u0026nbspBoris Johnson\u0027s government within days\u0026nbspof MPs returning to parliament after the summer recess, in an effort to stop a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit.Senior frontbencher\u0026nbspRebecca Long-Bailey\u0026nbspmade the remarks as\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn\u0026nbspdelivered a\u0026nbspdramatic offer to be caretaker prime minister\u0026nbspand secure a Brexit extension if he is successful in toppling Mr Johnson.More from Ashley Cowburn:Labour to attempt to bring down Boris Johnson\u0027s government within \u0027days\u0027 of parliament resuming\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf Britain wants a trade deal with the US, it must accept American food standards, including those allowing genetic modification and chicken to be washed in chlorine, the head of America’s farming lobby has said.Both of those practices are controversial in the UK.

As such, it is unclear how Apple will choose to name them.The current line-up is made up of the iPhone XS, which is the luxury version the XS Max, which is the same but bigger and the iPhone XR, which is cheaper but in the middle of the sizes.The new phones are rumoured to have the same rough structure, which has led to questions about how they could be named. Apple could stick with the roman numerals and name the new phone XI, for instance, or could drop the numbers in the same way as it did with the iPads.But a new series of reports suggest that the new phones could actually be called the iPhone 11. The luxury version is rumoured to be called the iPhone 11 Pro, according to the same reports, and the bigger version is due to keep the Max branding.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

But they have been known to be wrong in the past, especially with the naming and branding of products, which can be changed at the last moment.Apple is expected to unveil the new phones in the second week of September, at a media event that will be broadcast around the world.

Applications for settlement have increased from £885 to £1,523, a rise of 72 per cent.However, analysis of Home Office annual accounts shows that the department’s surplus from visa applications has increased at an even higher rate.\u0026nbspThe figure stood at £178.6m for the five years before 2014, but over the past five years,\u0026nbspthe department has made £1.6bn, and £438.1m\u0026nbsplast year alone – equating to £8.4m each week.The contract handed to\u0026nbspVFS\u0026nbspmade it mandatory for contractors to provide certain “premium services”, including premium lounges and priority visa services, some costing in excess of £1,500. The Home Office said that\u0026nbspwhen the contract was renewed in 2018, premium lounges were removed as a mandated service.Fees were also introduced for applicants wishing to make a query about their application, at £5.48 per query for the email service and £1.37 per minute for the phone helpline.Contract documents released under freedom of information laws to Finance Uncovered show the Home Office takes a cut of the revenues these premium services generate, but the department refused to state how much it has received.The Home Office insisted it did not make a profit from visa applications and said income generated from visa fees funded the wider immigration system – an apparatus which includes\u0026nbspthe controversial immigration detention estate, on which the department spent £523.5m\u0026nbspbetween April 2013 and March 2017.Labour’s shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the scale of the charges was “truly shocking”, adding: “These are people who we have welcomed here, for work, for business, for study. The Home Office should not be ripping people off, and profiteering by private companies has no place in public services.”Nicole Francis, chief executive of Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, said the organisation was concerned about the “poor level of service”\u0026nbspprovided by VFS and the Home Office benefiting\u0026nbspfrom the offer of premium services. She\u0026nbspadded: “The information collected as part of this article suggests that we were right to be worried.”She expressed concern that the premium services being offered\u0026nbspmay exploit vulnerable and less well-informed migrants,who may feel pressured to purchase an expensive service which will not provide them with any benefit.How visitors feel exploited by the UK’s outsourced visa systemJohn Vassiliou, partner at McGill and Co solicitors, said VFS had “been allowed to flourish despite this lack of competence” and claimed the Home Office did not exert enough control over outsourced visa services.“It’s gross maladministration,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Our clients have had to endure stress, hassle, disruption to their lives, and significant legal expenses in order to resolve what ultimately was a very simple yet significant failure on the part of VFS: scanning essential documents.”The Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration is investigating the outsourced visa system, with a report due later this year looking at customer experience and whether the contract had delivered on the promised benefits.\u0026nbspThe figures\u0026nbspcome\u0026nbspfollowing widespread concern over the\u0026nbspprivatisation\u0026nbspof the Home Office’s in-country visa system, which was outsourced to French firm\u0026nbspSopra\u0026nbspSteria\u0026nbspin November and has since, according to lawyers, offered a “substandard” service for “inflated” prices. A\u0026nbspSopra\u0026nbspSteria\u0026nbspspokesperson said at the time that its service was experiencing “higher than anticipated demand” and that it would be increasing the availability of free appointments at its core centres.A Home Office spokesperson said it demanded the highest standards from service providers. A VFS spokesperson said\u0026nbspoptional services were “developed in response to specific demands from applicants for greater accessibility, personalisation and convenience in visa services – they are determined in consultation with, and agreed by, the respective governments”.\u0026nbspThey added that the services were clearly labelled as optional, while visa decisions were “the sole prerogative of the concerned embassyconsulate”.UK Visas and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In fact,\u0026nbspVFS describes him as the “pioneer of the visa outsourcing model”.In an interview with Forbes last year, he explained that he started VFS in 2001 while at Kuoni and after he had “persuaded the US government to pilot a scheme for Indian visa applicants to the US at its Mumbai embassy”.In 2003, the company – then based in Mumbai – won its first contract with the British government: to administer visa applications made in India to come to the UK.\u0026nbspOver the next few years, it won similar contracts with other European governments including France and Germany.\u0026nbspThen, in\u0026nbsp2014, it won a contract with the UK to administer around 70 per cent\u0026nbspof the UK’s visa applications. This contract mandated the provision of optional user-paid services like “premium lounges”, courier return services and “super priority” visas.\u0026nbspThe UK’s contract was not with “VFS Global” – but with VF Worldwide Holdings, a company registered in the African tax haven of Mauritius.The most recent financial records we could find for VF Worldwide Holdings are from 2009. At that point it was by far the most profitable subsidiary in the VFS group, reporting profits of £20m. By comparison, its Indian parent company disclosed pretax profits of INR 212m (£2.6m).\u0026nbspVF Worldwide Holdings, which relocated to Dubai in 2017, is now a key holding company for the group and has received hundreds of millions of pounds from the dozens of governments it deals with.The UK government alone has paid an estimated £150m to it since the start of its 2014 deal.In 2016, Kuoni Group was bought by Swedish private equity firm EQT for $1.5bn. Since then, VFS has seen extraordinary growth.\u0026nbspHow visitors feel exploited by the UK’s outsourced visa systemAccording to high-level VFS holding company accounts in Luxembourg – a step further up the corporate chain than the Dubai entity – revenues increased by 60 per cent\u0026nbspbetween 2016 and 2018.\u0026nbspThe company reports that its growth has been driven by “higher value-added service revenues”, meaning more applicants buying expensive premium services. Lawyers say these services\u0026nbsphave led to the “commercialisation of life decisions”.\u0026nbspAn analysis of the Luxembourg accounts suggests\u0026nbspthat VFS’s shareholders have extracted CHF664.8m (£567m) via idends and writing off intercompany loans in the past two years.\u0026nbspThe most recent success for VFS came in 2018 when it landed another major deal, this time with the Canadian government.Having recently sold off the less profitable businesses in the Kuoni Group, EQT is now rumoured to have put VFS up for sale at an estimated price of $2.5bn.\u0026nbspVFS’s response to our request for comment suggested that such reports were “based on market rumours”.\u0026nbspBut the management’s outlook for the\u0026nbspmarket is sunny. Their Luxembourg holding company –\u0026nbspthe catchily named Kiwi VFS Sub Sarl I\u0026nbsp –\u0026nbsppredicts that trends including “global concern regarding security threats, migration control and the increased outsourcing trend by governments” will “further strengthen the attractiveness of the visa outsourcing industry”.Additional reporting Nick Mathiason and Ted JeoryUK Visas and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But reality is more complicatedClick to followThe IndependentIf Britain wants a trade deal with the US, it must accept American food standards, including those allowing genetic modification and chicken to be washed in chlorine, the head of America’s farming lobby has said.Both of those practices are controversial in the UK. Washing chicken carcasses in chlorinated water to kill off harmful bacteria is banned in the EU. And unlike the US, the EU has also not approved any fresh genetically modified (GM) fruit or vegetables for human consumption.But Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said concerns over the practices are not “science-based”.“There is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash, just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away,” Mr Duvall, a poultry farmer in Georgia, told BBC Radio 4.“If there was something wrong with it, our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Created with Sketch.The exercise it takes to burn off high-calorie foods Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 calories310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 caloriesBoth the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the British Poultry Council have said eating meat treated in that way is safe.However, the EFSA opposes chlorine rinsing because it enables farmers to lower their standards of animal welfare and hygiene as they can simply use a chemical bath to kill off any harmful pathogens after animals are slaughtered.The EU takes what it calls an integrated approach to food safety, “from farm to fork covering all sectors of the food chain”. As part of that approach, there are minimum legal requirements for the amount of space, lighting and ventilation in EU poultry-rearing houses.As there are no laws governing this in the US, the birds can be crammed in tightly, according to Simon Dawson, a food safety expert at Cardiff politan University. This reduces production costs but increases the risks of disease and contamination in a flock.“Some US abattoirs and processing plants rely heavily on chlorination because their other hygiene standards are so poor that they would be illegal in Europe,” Mr Dawson wrote in 2017.“The process is also very good at removing odours and surface slime, meaning the meat can be passed off as fresh for much longer than it should be.”The EU is less strict on GM food, allowing some such products to be sold provided the EFSA has deemed them safe and they are labelled as GM.The World Health Organisation says it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM crops, and that each food should be assessed separately.Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s national security adviser said the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal with the US after Brexit.John Bolton suggested that the US could focus on striking bilateral trade deals in certain sectors like manufacturing and car-making and work out more complicated areas later.According to Mr Duvall, though, any trade agreement would have to include agriculture.“To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that’s where a big part of our population lives,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “Any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies.\u0026nbsp“We have been clear on numerous occasions that we will not compromise on our high food or animal welfare standards as part of any trade deals.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There were security checkpoints in every city centre street, bag searches in most shops.In my teenage years, when I attended school in the west of Ulster, one of my fellow pupils was killed in the infamous IRA bomb attack on Lord Mountbatten’s boat off the Irish coast in .Two years later, the terrorist and hunger striker Bobby Sands was briefly my MP before his self-inflicted death, an event that provoked more rioting.Despite the ruthlessness of the IRA, the British security forces never wavered in their duty.Even in the face of mortal danger from petrol bombs, stones and even bullets, the soldiers did not buckle.In the cauldron of historic animosities, stoked by the venom of the IRA, they showed impressive forbearance, undermining the Republican propaganda about British oppression.There were disastrous failures, however, like the loss of discipline at Bloody Sunday in Derry, , when British paratroopers fired on a group of protesters, killing  of them.Over the years, their tenacity gradually wore down the enemy, particularly through the use of sophisticated military intelligence.Towards the end of the s, the entire IRA network was riddled with British agents.Even Frank Scappaticci, the Republicans’ own head of its feared Internal Security Unit – known as the “Nutting Squad” - was alleged to be an informer.Such deep penetration made it almost impossible for the IRA to carry on using the bomb and the bullet effectively .By the close of the Troubles, British security forces were estimated to be foiling two out of every three planned IRA operations.One former IRA man, now a Dublin solicitor, admitted, “It was a complete and utter defeat, absolutely.”It was a defeat that heralded a new era in Northern Ireland.In practice, the peace process was a declaration of surrender by the IRA.Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness did not suddenly see the light and become peaceniks.They embraced democratic politics because they recognised that their terror movement, beaten by the British forces, could no longerproperly.After the Good Friday Agreement of , the Republicans agreed to decommission their weapons without achieving any of their key political aims. Northern Ireland remains in the United Kingdom, while the partition of Ireland continues.For political reasons, the British army has never received the credit it deserves for its remarkable victory.In the new climate of co-operation, there is an understandable wish to avoid any triumphalism.But what is reprehensible is the persistent hounding of British veterans who bravely served their country in the Troubles, but are now the subject of official inquiries into past misconduct.No fewer than  of these veterans are said to be currently under investigation, despite endless pledges from politicians about an end to the grotesque witch-hunts.The gross betrayal of their service is bad enough, but even more offensive are the double-standards, for the Good Friday Agreement facilitated the early release of scores of terrorists, as well an amnesty for many on the run.If the peace process is meant to draw a line in the sand about Ulster’s dark past, it should apply to everyone.Thanks in large part to the efforts of the British army, the future should be bright for Northern Ireland.But clouds are gathering, due to suspension of the devolved assembly and concerns about a hard border because of Brexit.The fragility of the situation means that British politicians should tread carefully, respecting the rights of both communities in the province, as well as the interests of Dublin, our closest neighbour.But the Tories have done anything but that.Having thrown away their majority in , they have formed a dubious alliance with the DUP, a reactionary outfit which presents itself as the voice of Ulster but in fact won only  per cent of the vote at the last election.As cheerleaders for unionism, the Conservatives now talk about “our precious union”, while regrettably Boris Johnson has even given himself the additional title of “Minister for the Union.”Whilst many Brits feel passionate about keeping the union together, this rhetoric may not be what Northern Ireland needs.The British Government is meant to be an honest broker rather than a partisan advocate for one side.“Rigorous impartiality” was central to the success of the Good Friday Agreement.

It wasn’t fake fur at all,” the trader said.“It looked like he needed to be dusted.”And the tiger, the trader said, “was huge.”“I don’t think the pictures really give proper dimensions,” he said.“The desk had to be one of the biggest desks I’ve ever seen, and that tiger just dwarfed it.”The trader said he was ushered out of Epstein’s office after about  minutes and brought to a nondescript waiting room before being introduced to the financier.“I remember he had a really hot secretary and he came off with a lot of bravado,” the trader said.But while Epstein was “very enthusiastic during the presentation,” he never followed up afterward, despite the fact that he heard pitches from a group of hedge funders who offered “four dferent strategies and styles.”“There were some really quality guys that we put before him,” the trader said.“It makes me think – just purely speculation – that they weren’t really trading, just pretending to trade.” The paedophile banker, , died from hanging last Saturday in his jail cell while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges.Since his arrest and suicide, Epstein’s New York townhouse has become a dark tourism attraction with people posing for pictures outside the Upper East Side property.Earlier this week, it was revealed that the disgraced financier kept a bizarre painting of former US President Bill Clinton wearing a blue dress.A version of this story originally appeared on The New York Post."},{"url":null,"title":"giant spiders to invade uk homes again summer washout","story":"The August washout could bring the insects into our homes quicker than expected - as spiders believe its already autumn.Spiders usually seek shelter in warm places during September, but frantic homeowners across the country are already spotting the creepy crawlies in their homes.Central heating provides the perfect conditions for the females to lay their eggs, and the summer deluge has tricked the spiders into thinking its already mating season.This summer has been a weather whirlwind for Britain - as the hottest July ever was recorded, swtly followed by one of the wettest Augusts on record.The hottest day EVER was recorded this July, as mercury reached a sweltering .C in Cambridge.However, the warm weather didnt last long - as August brought downpours, severe weather warnings, and is now on track to be the wettest August on record.The dramatic weather change has caused confusion for the eight-legged creatures, bringing them into our homes sooner than expected.Pest controller Clive Boase has also warned of a rise in  widows — the UKs only native poisonous spider, which have shiny black bodies.He said: “They’re more common than most people think.There are half-a-dozen dferent species of the  widow and they can survive both indoors and outdoors.They prefer suburban areas and are most commonly found around domestic and commercial premises.They love conservatories and toilet blocks, window frames, porches, lofts and garages and they like to live beneath kitchen appliances and cupboards.“They certainly can give a painful bite but only as a last resort.”"},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn to force owners empty shops to accept new tenants free","story":"His Labour government would give councils sweeping powers to take over the management of any high street stores that have been vacant for  months.The local authorities would then decide who would occupy them, from start-up businesses to cooperatives and community projects, on a non-profit basis.Figures show that more than ten per cent of town centre shops are empty due to the changing nature of retail and crippling business rates.Labour boss Mr Corbyn last night insisted his move would turn “the blight of empty shops into the heart of the high street”.Under the plan, landlords would re­gain control of properties onlythey produce a tenant that wins council approval.But Tories warned the state intervention into the property market risks spooking investors.Local Growth minister Jake Berry said: “Jeremy Corbyn would wreck the economy, tax small businesses and scare off investment needed to help high streets, meaning more boarded-up shops and fewer jobs.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I know, as I have used it in the past.Butanything is likely to encourage disordered eating in the first place — and potentially trigger a lelong struggle with food — an app that encourages children under ten to categorise food as “good” and “bad” and to focus on weight loss, rather than see food as a way to fuel a healthy body sounds like a good start to me.Weight Watchers, or WW as it is now called, describes its weight-loss app Kurbo as “helping kids and teens reach a healthier weight and build healthy habits”.The app, which launched in the US on Tuesday and will soon launch globally, has a Snapchat- inspired interface and multi-day streaks to encourage regular activity.It ranks food choices using a “traffic light” system — green items are “go foods” that can be eaten freely, yellow foods should be eaten in moderate portions and red foods should make kids “stop and think”.The company claims it wants to educate kids about their health amid a spiralling obesity epidemic in the US, UK and other countries. There’s no disputing that there is an obesity epidemic.But we also have a mental health crisis brewing in our young people, with anxiety and eating disorders on the rise, especially among young girls.Last year saw a dramatic rise in hospital admissions for potentially le-threatening eating disorders.So the question is whether or not an app targeting kids aged eight to  and encouraging them to focus on their weight is helping to solve the obesity problem, or risks sparking obsessive and unhealthy eating behaviours in some children.My money is on the latter. In a response to some of the many critical comments along those lines, WW tweeted: “Kurbo provides kids with tools to make balanced food choices and manage their weight in a healthy way.”But in my view, the job of providing kids with those tools belongs to their parents. As for “managing their weight in a healthy way”, any child under  should be guided by parents, not their phone.Kids don’t need weight loss apps. And something that encourages teens to check their phones even more doesn’t seem the best idea. But also, we should be making sure they are making good choices daily, by talking to them about the benefits of healthy eating.We should be demonstrating to them what a balanced diet looks like, rather than encouraging them to see weight loss as a goal, which is often unachievable in a whole letime, let alone in your early years.At worst, an app that encourages children to focus on their weight is like a gateway drug to an eating disorder. One thing I know for sure is that being obsessed by your weight is a road to lelong misery.If we want our children to be healthy, fit and strong, we should turn their attention towards positive role models like Serena Williams and Andy Murray, rather than to a calorie-counting app on their phone.I’ve been looking out the window at the washout weather – and my new sun lounger, which I bought excitedly in July to “make the most” of the sunny weather  . . . which promptly stopped.Summer in the UK takes place in June and July. From August onwards, it’s basically autumn.There is a silver lining, though. Now my kids are older I’m free of the tyranny of school holidays. So I might still get away before Christmas.EVERY time photos of Madonna are published these days, she is on the receiving end of criticism.But you have got to admire the shots she shared on Instagram of rehearsals for her Madame X tour.There she was, hair in rollers, just casually lying there on her phone, doing upside-down splits, legs properly akimbo.Don’t forget she is  – and a role model for all of us.

Nor was she told that he had been granted an unsupervised --hour travel warrant.Police protection offered to her in that time was just the advice to stay away from her home and only towhen his electronic tag had been fitted.He’s currently allowed to roam free between am and pm. I can imagine that has left her feeling very uneasy. But what’s worse is how little support she has received as the victim in this situation – basically none.Lest we forget, she also reminded me of last year’s statistics – ten women a week attempted suicide as a direct result of domestic abuse, three successfully.Add that to the two women a week who were murdered by a current or former partner, and that makes five women a week who died as a result of domestic abuse.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Something you’re awardedyou’ve achieved something of merit that requires great skill and talent.Trophy hunting is the opposite of that. It is cruel, it is sick, it is cowardly.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harry private jet french riviera ibiza","story":"The trip to Nice created seven times more carbon emissions per person than a commercial flight.The couple arrived on the French Riviera on Wednesday aboard a -seater Cessna aircraft that would cost more than £, to hire.There are more than  scheduled departures from London airports to Nice each Wednesday.An easyJetflight from London airports to Nice next Wednesday is currently £ per person.Meghan,  — in a white blouse and cream sun hat — cradled baby Archie as she left their plane, registered to luxury firm Net Jets.Prince Harry,  — wearing a green polo shirt, blue cap and shades — then emerged from the Cessna Citation Sovereign as airport officials and royal security waited on the tarmac.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s holiday is their second European jaunt on a private plane this month. They flew into the new hypocrisy row just two days after ing from Ibiza.The Sun told on Thursday how the pair had been slammed over their flight to the Spanish isle — where they stayed in a villa.Both incidents come just weeks after Harry — who has vowed to cut their carbon footprint — was blasted over private jet travel to Sicily for a Google summit on the climate.The couple set off for France on Wednesday morning.They travelled  miles from Windsor to private Farnborough Airport, Hants where they boarded the £million Cessna.Prince Harry, Meghan and three-month-old Archie — pictured in May — were then snapped arriving in Nice.As he disembarked, Harry seemed to be trying to avoid being seen as he stared towards the ground.A woman — dressed in black and with braided hair and thought to be a royal aide — also emerged from the plane.Security guards were then seen loading a Mercedes people carrier which was waiting for the royal visitors beside a police van.Harry, Meghan and Archie — accompanied by minders — were then whisked straight from the tarmac in a business section of the airport in the blacked-out Merc.They were then holed up in a private villa overlooking the sun-kissed Mediterranean.On Saturday night it was unclear whether they were still on the Riviera, or had jetted back to the UK.The plane which took the royals to Nice was recorded as leaving the airport at the French city and ing to Farnborough — landing shortly after .pm yesterday.On Saturday night Labour MP Teresa Pearce called on Harry and Meghan to “lead by example” on environmental issues.Ms Pearce said: “Given the position they have taken publicly about being responsible on climate change, this does seem an anomaly which they should look at.“It’s up to all of us to cut our carbon emissions, and the number of flights we take a year.“That is really important — and someone as high profile as that should lead by example.“I find this quite surprising because it doesn’t fit with their public image and the way they’re so concerned about the planet and the environment.”Two weeks ago, Prince Harry said in a Vogue Magazine interview with conservationist Jane Goodall that he and Meghan would have only two children due to environmental concerns. In the issue — guest edited by Meghan — Harry said he and his we had planned for “two, maximum”.The Prince added: “I’ve always thought, this place is borrowed.“And, surely, being as intelligent as we all are, or as evolved as we all are supposed to be, we should be able to leave something better behind for the next generation.”Harry — who has warned of the “terrying” effects of climate change — said in an Instagram post in July: “With nearly . billion people inhabiting this Earth, every choice, every footprint, every action makes a dference.”And in March, he gave a powerful speech at WE Day — a celebration of young people making a dference — urging his generation to make a change.He said: “Climate change is a humanitarian issue not a political one, and one where we’ve been far too slow in waking up to the issues and acting on the damaging impact our ways of living are having on the world. We now have the facts, the science, the technology and the ability to save not just our planet but ourselves. You don’t just sit back and wait for solutions, you take action and create them.”The carbon footprint of an average Brit is around  tonnes per year. Harry and Meghan’s trip to France is estimated to have had a footprint of just over three tonnes.Their earlier Ibiza jaunt had a footprint of more than four tonnes.Each Wednesday there are nine direct, business-class flights to Nice from London airports – and more than  planes with economy seats available.Harry, Meghan and Archie flew to Ibiza on Tuesday August  by private jet and ed on Monday August . That trip was Archie’s first holiday abroad and timed to mark Meghan’s birthday.The royals are thought to have spent two nights at their Frogmore Cottage home in the grounds of Windsor Castle before hiring another private jet to the French Riviera.Sixth in line to the throne Harry was also criticised for travelling on a private jet to Sicily for the celebrity-filled Google Camp at the end of July.He is also believed to have used a helicopter to transfer to the event and stayed overnight on a gas-guzzling private yacht.At the event — also attended by Katy Perry, Leonardo DiCaprio and Bradley Cooper — Harry is said to have delivered a speech on climate change barefoot.In the past, royals have travelled in VIP areas of scheduled flights — and on budget airlines. In , Harry surprised fellow travellers by flying to Transylvania on budget airline Wizz Air from Luton.In , Prince William flew by Ryanair to Scotland.He also flew economy with we Kate on Flybe in  for Zara Philips’ wedding to Mike Tindall.Ex-royal protection officer Ken Wharfe criticised Harry and Meghan over their private jets.Mr Wharfe — who guarded Princess Diana and William and Harry in the s — said: “During my time at the palace most of the flights we took were commercial on British Airways. You’re better off with BA security because they’re used to working with VIPs.“Frankly it’s hypocritical. Harry can’t be preaching about the catastrophic effects of climate change while jetting around the world on a private plane.”A royal source said Harry and Meghan would have paid for their own transport as it was a private journey. Buckingham Palace declined to comment.Either they can continue lecturing the world about fighting climate change — or they can carry on using gas-guzzling ­private jets.They are not Hollywood stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, who does the same, but members of a royal family who are duty bound to practise what they preach. So they cannot keep using PJs, as they call them, without looking like hypocrites.Sometimes they may need to be somewhere at a certain time for work duties, but a holiday is dferent. William and Kate regularly take commercial flights with their children to places like Mustique.Royals can have two rows of first class sectioned off and can board last minute.Harry and Meghan need to think of the damage their behaviour is doing not only to the ozone layer but to themselves.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not for a moment did they envisage having to act on it.The letter was — like almost everything Mr Corbyn has ever said or done — about posturing rather than acting. The Labour leader spent  years as a backbencher before his elevation to being Leader of the Opposition.During those three decades he achieved precisely nothing.Had he not been elected leader, the few people to have been aware of his existence would have known him as a minor fringe MP who hung out with terrorists and racists.The sum total of his contribution to politics as a backbencher was to have proposed  Early Day Motions, the parliamentary equivalent of tweeting.Topics which he considered worth his time included “seal genitalia”, “Disney children’s pyjamas” and an MI proposal to use pigeons as flying bombs.Mr Corbyn’s natural disposition is to tear down, to criticise and to oppose.He could not even bring himself to support his own party when it was in power, voting against the last Labour government  times.There is not a single piece of legislation that owes anything to his contribution.This is the context in which his and Labour’s seemingly incoherent stance on Brexit — one day against another referendum, another day for one one day for Brexit, another day for Remain — must be seen.He is uninterested in the mechanics of a concrete solution. He has no real views on the details of Brexit or even how we get there.For Mr Corbyn, Brexit is a means to an end — which is as a vehicle to power.That is why, for example, he has on  occasions instructed Labour MPs either to abstain or to vote with the Government on Brexit, rather than attempting in any serious way to force the Government to change course, either over the type or Brexit on offer or a second referendum.He wants Brexit.He and his coterie of revolutionary socialists believe that leaving without a deal will be chaotic and that in that chaos Labour will be swept into office.But that, by definition, requires Brexit both to happen and to be chaotic.Most of his party take a dferent view — most are Remainers — so every so often the Corbynites view it as tactically wise to offer the appearance of wanting to work against the Government’s version of Brexit.Hence yesterday’s letter. But it is all meaningless posing. In her speech yesterday rejecting Mr Corbyn’s demand that she support him as PM, Jo Swinson hit the nail on the head.She said: “In my first week as leader of the Liberal Democrats I called on Jeremy Corbyn to table a vote of no confidence in the Government and I asked him to table it before summer recess, because that was the only way to be sure we could hold an election before crashing out on the st of October.”You do not have to share Ms Swinson’s opposition to Brexit to accept that her analysis is spot on.Mr Corbyn refused to table such a vote of no confidence at the end of July.

Skies will start clearing from Monday, with warm air arriving by midweek, the Met Office says. It will be a welcome change for Brits who have had to put up with a storm-hit August which could be on track to be the wettest for seven years. The Met Office has forecast C sunny spells in the South and East at the start of the week, with C on the cards by the long weekend. High pressure is set to bring subtropical air from the Azores, while the North and West will still see showers at times. The Met Office forecasts three weeks of mainly warm and dry conditions for many for the last week of August and first half of September.    And ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond, of weathertrending, said temperatures could push C. He said: Summer lurched from hot to cool and wet, but warmer weather in time for the Bank Holiday will lt the mood of weather-beaten Brits. Temperatures should be not far from C for some at the end of August. Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst said: Thereaposs an improvement after wet and windy weather, with plenty of sunny spells through the next week and C possible by the Bank Holiday weekend. Low pressure clears from Monday and high pressure slowly builds, with a southerly flow possible, with fewer showers in the South and East while the North and West remain less settled.    High pressure looks like dominating in the last week of August, with mainly settled conditions and the mid-s possible. That is likely to continue into September, his Met Office colleague Sarah Kent continued. She said: August  to September  has signs high pressure will increasingly dominate. Temperatures are likely to be warmer than average.

It is almost too painful to read about. Today the Sunday Mirror campaigns on one of the most dficult issues we have ever tackled – children killed by their own parents. Gwyneth lost daughter Kim, granddaughter Kayleigh and great-granddaughter Kimberley. Three generations wiped out in a fire started by Kimberley’s father, Kayleigh’s abuser. The killer is serving  years for the murders, but they need not have happened in the first place had he been kept away from them. And that is what the Mirror is campaigning for today. A change in the law which would put child safety before human rights. As things stand now social services have to fight to stop someone with a history of violence or child abuse or sex offending from seeing their child. We believe it should be the other way round. A parent with that kind of background should prove he – for it is mostly men – is fit to be with children. The figures tell their own horror story of how this has gone wrong. Sixty-three children dead at the hands of their parents since . That is not an arbitrary date. It was when the Children’s Act was updated in the wake of the Victoria Climbie tragedy. After the eight-year-old was tortured and starved to death the cry went up: No more Victoria Climbies. The nine-month probe by the Mirror’s award-winning Geraldine McKelvie shows how that fell on deaf ears in the corridors of power.  Of the  who died  were killed by fathers known to the authorities as domestic abusers. Seven involved both parents. In many cases family members recognised the danger and tried in vain to raise the alarm. When children die in such circumstances scapegoats are sought. But our campaign is not aimed at social workers or the police, judges or lawyers. They have to operate within the laws MPs give them. It is the system which is at fault and it is the system which must be changed. Our campaign is backed by the domestic violence charity Refuge and shadow Home Office minister Carolyn Harris. Refuge wants to see the law changed and Carolyn will do her damndest to change it. We want to deny anyone convicted of violent crime, child abuse or sex offences an automatic right to be with their children unsupervised. Social workers and judges involved in family cases should have proper training in domestic abuse so they know exactly what they are dealing with. And funding should be made available to support the specialist therapy children who have become victims so desperately need. It is too late to end Gwyneth Swain’s living nightmare or to bring back loved ones so tragically and needlessly lost. But it is not too late to stop this happening again. . A change in the law, which means anyone who has been convicted of violent crime, child abuse or sexual offences can’t have automatic, unsupervised access to their kids. The same rules would apply to those who’d had similar findings made against them in the civil courts.The ban could only be overturned by a judgethe parent had undergone a thorough assessment by an independent expert proving they have been rehabilitated. . Mandatory, standardised training in domestic abuse for judges, social workers and any other professionals involved in child access arrangements.We also want to see domestic abuse training for coroners overseeing domestic homicide inquests. . More State funding to support the hundreds of thousands of children in the UK affected by domestic abuse – including the , kids currently being supported by Refuge.It is only with the right support, such as specialist therapy, that these children can recover from the trauma they have experienced."},{"url":null,"title":"airport security guards rude note","story":"NewsAirport security guards rather rude note to passenger gets her firedThe woman was caught on CCTV laughing at Rochester International Airport, Minnesota, but soon regretted her actionsShareCommentsByBradley JollyOnline journalist:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video airport-security-guard-fired-after-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email CCTV captures a wicked security guard cackle after handing a passenger a note which read You ugly at an airport.The woman, who has not been named, gave Neal Strassner, , the tatty scrap of paper as he walked through the scanner at Rochester International Airport, Minnesota.

One biography claims that tate was often cheated on by Polanski, who also persuaded her to make home-made sex films and take part in threesomes. When she was a young struggling actress, Tate is believed to have dated Richard Beymer, who was  years older than her. And she was once engaged to actor Philippe Forquet, who it is claimed had a temper. Tate is rumoured to have been beaten by her lover and is even said to have once stabbed him in the chest with a wine bottle.    Great Escape legend Steve McQueen is also rumoured to have had a relationship with Tate before she started dating hairdress Jay Sebring, who was killed alongside her by Mansonaposs followers. Their relationship ended when she started seeing Polanski while he was directing her. Urban legend claims he made her re-shoot a scene in The Fearless Vampire KIllers  times before he was happy with it. Tate also appeared naked on screen in the movie, something that was still considered controversial in the s. Ed Sanders, the biographer who wrote Sharon Tate: A Le, claims that Polanski liked to hold orgies at the home he shared with his we in LA.    He would film these sex parties and then play the tapes at parties with his famous pals. Polanski is also said to have tried to control what Tate wore. Then, on August , , Tateaposs le ended in the most horric way. Each of the murders was brutal -  Jay was was shot after he tried to stop the gang attacking Sharon and then stabbed seven times. Steven Parent, a friend of the houseaposs caretaker, was shot and killed as The Family, minus Charles, burst into the home in Los Angeles.    He was just . Wojciech was asleep on the sofa when The Family barged in and was kicked in the head by Tex Watson. When Wojciech asked him what he was doing he chillingly replied I am the devil and Iaposm here to do the devilaposs business. Watson then started to tie Sharon and Jay together with a rope round their necks and slung it over the beam in the living room. Abigail was ordered into the bedroom to get her purse and handed  over to The Family.    She managed to flee out of a bedroom door but was followed by Patricia Krenwinkel, who caught her and stabbed her. But worse was the come for Abigail who was eventually killed by Watson, who stabbed her  times. Wojciechaposs hands had been bound by a towel but he managed to free himself and started to struggle with Atkins. She kept stabbing at his legs but as he struggled out of the house, he was caught by Watson and hit over the head with a gun. He was then stabbed multiple times, shot twice but still fought to escape the house.    Wojciech was eventually killed when he was stabbed  times. Sharon herself was stabbed many times in the chest and strangled. Her mutilated and broken body was found with the cord used in the killing still around her neck. Tragically, her baby - due to be born within weeks - did not survive the horric injuries suffered by his mother. Meanwhile, Sharon was desperately not only fighting for her own le but also that of her unborn baby.    The -year-old actress made the ultimate sacrice to keep herself alive for long enough for her baby to be born. She offered herself up as a hostage - her pleas fell on deaf ears. Itaposs not clearWatson or Atkins stabbed Tate and delivered the fatal blow. But she was kned  times and as she was being attacked she cried out mother... mother. Once the killers had butchered their victims, they used the bloody towel that had bound Wojciechaposs hands to write the word apospigapos on the front door of Sharonaposs home in blood.    Just a day after the Tate murder, The Family struck again. Supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his we, Rosemary, were killed at their home in LA. Officers did not link the two crime scenes. Then, in December , members of the Manson Family were arrested for a series of car thefts and while she was in custody she told her fellow prisoners of the other crimes she had been involved in - including the murders. The rest of the gang were arrested a few days later and their trial began on June , .

The post encourages people to ask Google why Corn Flakes were invented, adding: You will thank me later.So many people began enquiring about the creation of the humble corn flake only to discover something pretty shocking.     John Kellogg, a physician, and anti-sex campaigner is said to have believed that eating a bland diet would help reduce sexual urges. Thus some people think his Corn Flakes, being bland, were developed to stop people from experiencing these urges and pleasuring themselves.This unusual theory has recently resurfaced in a new book by Kate Devlin called Turned On: Science Sex and Robots, where itaposs claimed the breakfast was invented as an anti-masturbatory morning meal.However, before you got telling all your friends, it seems that this might not quite be the case.   After bizarre theories about Corn Flakes began to swirl online, fact-checking resource Snopes decided to do a little digging.They say that the aposanti-masturbatoryapos claims are mostly  - as Kellogg never specically advertised the cereal in this way. In a post on their site, they explain: The creation of Corn Flakes was part of J.H. Kelloggaposs broader advocacy for a plain, bland diet. Without referring to Corn Flakes in particular, Kellogg where recommended a plain, bland diet as one of several methods to discourage masturbation. They added: According to the available evidence, Corn Flakes were primary created as an easy-to-digest, pre-prepared and healthy breakfast food, in particular for patients at the Kellogg sanitarium in Michigan. The product was never advertised as an aposanti-masturbatory morning mealapos.[The phrase] originated instead with a  article by Mental Floss, which  reported  that aposKellogg developed a few dferent flaked grain breakfast cereals — including corn flakes — as healthy, ready-to-eat anti-masturbatory morning meals.aposWhether or not itaposs true, we can probably all agree that thereaposs nothing particularly sexy about Corn Flakes as Devlin hilariously points out in her book: Having visited a Corn Flakes factory, I can confirm that it was one of the least arousing places I have ever been.

the sides prepare for cup tie","story":"Dundee host Aberdeen in the Betfred Cup on Sunday and, eventhe Dons have had a few early season problems, it’s fair to say anything other than a win for them would be a shock.On the back of relegation, James McPake’s Dark Blues are finding their feet after a major overhaul of the squad during the summer.It means they go into this tie as major underdogs, though history does tell us this is a competition in which Dundee are capable of upsetting the odds.Tonight Tele Sport looks back at a couple of occasions when they have – and some others when the result has been true to the form book.While unlike the present format, this tie was over two legs, it was similar to this clash in that Dundee had just been relegated at the end of the previous season.Aberdeen were at the peak of their powers under Alex Ferguson and, as reigning champions, a bigger knockout tie for them was a European Cup meeting with Liverpool around the same time.That they went out of that competition to the team that would eventually win it was no great surprise but losing to Dundee was.After a draw at Dens in the first leg, the feeling was Donald Mackay’s team were heading to the Granite City hoping for little more than to keep the score respectable.In the end, however, a battling performance saw them hold their own and progress to the semi-finals thanks to a Cammy Fraser strike.Dundee would go on to make the final before losing to city rivals United on a historic day at Dens Park.The only time the north-east rivals have faced up in a national final and it was Aberdeen who lted the trophy with a comfortable Hampden victory.Once again, the pair met with Dundee, under Jim Duffy, out of the top flight but going into the tie on the back of a fine unbeaten run that saw them riding high in the First Division and making the final.For those of a Dark Blue persuasion, however, it quickly became a day to forget as their team didn’t really show up.An effort from former Dens favourite Billy Dodds had Aberdeen ahead by the break and, when Duncan Shearer added a second right at the start of the second half, it was all over bar the shouting.Although Dundee were again in the second tier, with the backing of Aberdeen-based businessman Callum Melville, their strong line-up was always going to provide a stern test for the visiting Dons.So it proved as, despite losing experienced goalkeeper Rab Douglas through injury in the first half, Jocky Scott’s team pulled off the result of the round by winning in extra-time.Goals from Eddie Malone and Craig Forsyth had the home team apparently cruising but a double from Michael Paton saw the proceedings heading into extra-time.As the game ebbed and flowed, one of those Melville-backed signings, a young Leigh Grfiths, came up trumps with the winner.The last time the teams met in a League Cup tie saw Dundee still recovering from a second period of administration that had seen the team almost fold the previous year.Having performed a miracle in keeping the team in the First Division in the   season, boss Barry Smith was looking to pull off a shock at Pittodrie.They battled hard to give him the scalp he wanted but, on the night, came up just short.A tight tie was decided as early as the th minute when home attacker Darren Mackie grabbed the only goal."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/27lgjmusic1.jpg ","title":"council to put dundee music centre on the market for 250000","story":"Music tuition in Dundee will continue unimpeded despite the intention to sell Bell Street Music Centre, council bosses have vowed.Dundee City Council is set to list the four-floor music centre – which boasts a first-floor performance hall – for sale in the coming days.The centre has been the city’s home of public music tuition for decades, with records showing its use as far back as the s.As recently as June the venue has been used for community concerts, such as that staged by the Help For Kids choir supported by the Eveningand Overgate.However, the local authority has drawn up plans to sell the local facility, along with a number of other public buildings, in a bid to cut down on maintenance costs.An advance notice touts the building as a “development opportunity” with a price tag of £,.“The main building was originally designed as a church and has more recently been used as a music centre with the outstanding feature being the large performance hall at first floor level,” it reads.A spokeswoman for Dundee City Council said: “The provision of music tuition will be unaffected by the sale of Bell Street Music Centre.“Music tuition will continue at alternate sites throughout the city.”The spokeswoman declined to elaborate on where these may be.However, it is likely the council will look to harness the facilities in its newer school buildings under its  Schools initiative.The Bell Street plan is part of the council’s “property rationalisation” scheme, drawn up to reduce its real estate footprint.Among the other buildings set for redundancy are Claverhouse Social Work Office, Dudhope Castle and a former Technology Park lab.The costs of keeping surplus properties has contributed to a £. million overspend in the council’s city development budget.Earlier this week the Tele reported the council had sold and leased back its own HQ to a Canadian firm to balance its books.Finance boss Greg Colgan’s latest financial assessment concludes: “Property rationalisation . . . will lead to properties being vacated thus generating revenue savings . . . and the possibility of a capital receipt from a sale of the asset.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/08-08-2019_-Kane-Hemmings-_dy_0116.jpg ","title":"dundee now have goalscorers galore who does boss james mcpake turn to","story":"In the space of just three short weeks, Dundee boss James McPake has gone from famine to feast with striking options.The capture of fans favourite Kane Hemmings last Thursday has undoubtedly added to the goal threat from the Dark Blues this season, evenhe couldn’t mark his second debut by finding the net.He joined another new striker on the books in the shape of Danny Johnson, a signing from Motherwell a fortnight previously.Longer-serving Andrew Nelson and Craig Curran had both come in back in the January transfer window but, with only four goals between them before this season, it’s clear the manager needed to bring in goalscorers over the summer.Tonight Tele Sport takes a look at the feast of options at the manager’s disposal:Dee appearances:  Goals: Career apps:  Goals: Plenty has been written about the -year-old and even more is expected of him this season.There’s little doubt he’ll be able to shoulder the responsibility of leading the line for Dundee as they chase promotion back to the top flight.Having notched  goals in the Premiership last time he was at Dens Park and ed more experienced, Hemmings will be a big part of James McPake’s side this season.After leaving the Dark Blues in the summer of , the former Rangers kid has continually knocked in goals, in particular at Mansfield Town and Notts County in English League Two.Anything north of

notching a barrowload in English non-league football, most notably  in  games at Guisborough Town that earned him a move to Cardf.And he’s made a great start to le in dark blue with a winning goal on his debut at home to Inverness followed up by a double from the spot to earn a point at Dunfermline.He didn’t hit those heights again in the win over Ayr United but three goals from his first three games is a start any striker would be happy with.Dee apps:  Goals: Career apps:  Goals: The former Sunderland man burst on to the scene with a superb winner at Tynecastle last season.And he’s shown continually in his performances since that he can have a big future at Dens Park,he keeps fit.A flurry of energy at the top end of the park, Nelson makes le uncomfortable for defenders and has  goals in  matches in Scottish football – a very decentfor someone only just about to turn .And his winning goal in the important - victory over Ayr United at the weekend reminded everyone at Dens Park of his ability in front of goal.Dee apps:  Goals: Career apps:  Goals: He may have indicated his desire tosouth due to family reasons but McPake has insisted Curran will remain part of his plans until that happens.He’s never been a consistent goalscorer – his struggles in front of goal at Dundee are a clear example – but is a manager’s dream in terms of commitment, workrate and attitude.Likely to be behind the others in the pecking order, however,he remains at the club.Backing those four up is Michael Cunningham, a young man the Dark Blues have high hopes for.As it stands, Dundee’s strikers have  senior goals between them – a wealth of options for boss McPake to get his head around."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d56cea005fae3.34061587.jpg ","title":"dundee united fans handed the shed for city derby","story":"Dundee United’s decision to give their fans three sides of Tannadice for the city derby is based on the belief the seats will be needed to meet demand from Arabs.In the past, these clashes have seen the Dark Blues support given the Shed End as well as the Fair Play and Jerry Kerr stands.But the attendances at last season’s play-off ties against Inverness and St Mirren suggests the Shed will be needed for home fans on August .“I don’t think it is a challenge to our fans, it’s a belief that they will come and fill it,” said Tangerines managing director Mal Brannigan.“We’ve had long conversations to say this is the approach we should take and we’ve obviously spoken to supporters groups to say this is what we’re planning on doing.”Manager Robbie Neilson was part of those talks and Brannigan revealed he is more than happy at the prospect of his club’s fans being behind both goals.“We’ve talked about it with the manager and asked ‘is this good for the first team ’,” he added.“He’s said whatever you can do to make it better for the team, then definitely.“From our perspective, we are trying to grow the season-ticket fanbase and at least twice since we’ve been here we’ve taken the Shed because it was needed.”He is also satisfied that, with over , tickets going up the road to Dens, the usual Dundee derby atmosphere will be maintained.“Traditionally some clubs will give you a corner or part of behind a goal. Dundee have all the Jerry Kerr and all the Fair Play, so that’s over , tickets.“I know Dundee will fill them but you come back to the balance between finance and creating the right environment for our first team.”Meanwhile, United are working on new deals for a number of their promising kids.The likes of Louis Appere, Scott Banks and Logan Chalmers have been involved in the early games of the season.That’s attracted interest from a number of bigger clubs down south and -year-old Banks was wanted by Crystal Palace at the end of the English transfer window last week.United, though, want to hang on to their young talent and to tie them up on new contracts.Striker Matty Smith has joined Cove on loan until January."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d52d45de51c22.14462233.jpg ","title":"josh todd doing all he can to secure place in dundee side facing aberdeen","story":"Dundee midfielder Josh Todd says he is doing all he can as he sets his sights on a place in James McPake’s starting line-up against Aberdeen.The former Queen of the South man has impressed off the bench in the Dark Blues’ opening two league fixtures, making a real impact both times.At Dunfermline, he entered the fray at half-time with the side a goal behind before they fought back for a point.Then, on Saturday, Todd once more found himself appearing from the bench, coming on with just over half-an-hour remaining.And again there was an improvement with the versatile attacking midfielder on the park as Dundee grabbed the winner through striker Andrew Nelson late on.Todd told the Tele: “As a player you just need to do what you can andyou get picked, you get picked.“I’ve been coming on and doing all I can to try to help the team get results.“That’s football, sometimes you are on the bench, sometimes you start.“Every player wants a starting spot but we’ll have to see over the next few weeks.“I feel like I’ve been doing well off the bench.“I feel like I had a good pre-season as well.“I got a little knock which has maybe held me back a little bit – the other boys have had four or five weeks under their belts and I missed seven days or something.“Maybe that’s held me back a wee bit but I am happy with my contributions when I’ve come on.“It’s the gaffer’s job to choose the team, it’s my job to put pressure on him to pick me.”And his next chance on the horizon is a big cup clash with Premiership Aberdeen at Dens Park on Sunday.Though, he agrees the Dons are one of the best sides in the country, Todd insists there will be nobody running scared in dark blue.He added: “We haven’t got anything to fear.“We are a new team but we all believe in each other. Yeah, they are the league above but, at the end of the day, it’s a one-off.“You never know what’ll happen because they could take their foot off the pedal a bit as well, anything can happen in the cup.“They have a good team, really good iniduals, too, so it is a big test.“We need to accept that and turn up ready to get at them, nothing to fear and try to get into the next round.”Dundee do go into the Betfred Cup knockout clash with confidence and an unbeaten run at their back.Saturday’s victory over the Honest Men made it six unbeaten through the early-season cup games and their two league contests.On top of that, they’ve amassed five clean sheets from those matches.“We believe in ourselves, there’s no doubt about that,” Todd said.“We got the draw on a hard Friday night at Dunfermline and then got our first win on Saturday.“Even though we do believe in ourselves, getting that first win on Saturday and getting the points really adds to that.“We just need to keep that up and try to get as many wins as possible.“In the Championship, we know every game is going to be tough, whether we can play football or grind it out as a team, but we got the win on Saturday which is the most important thing.“The first three points on the board and, hopefully, we can start building some momentum.“Ayr moved the ball really well on Saturday but our defence did their job and then ‘Neller’ came on to head home.#It’s great for the team to get the three points but it just showed how you can’t take any game lightly.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/pressandjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/Lounge-01-copy.jpg ","title":"sponsored win a beautiful scottish mansion just by answering one question","story":"The owners of a stunning five-bedroom home are offering you the chance to win their house – and help charity at the same time!Worth £,, the luxury home in Airdrie, Lanarkshire, has five bedrooms, four public rooms, a sun lounge – and a sauna in the attic!But after struggling to sell, the current owners decided to create a competition that will also give part of the profits to charity.The owner explained: “In a dficult property market, we had to consider an alternative and a more creative way… it’s that simple!“This is not a lottery but a competition, which is open to everyone over  years of age all over the world.“We believe that we have given every eligible person who answers the competition question correctly, an opportunity to benefit from a truly remarkable home in Scotland.”The website explains: “Built in the early ’s and situated in arguably one of the finest areas in Airdrie,  Alexander Street greatly benefits from its central location with all local amenities of Airdrie town centre within walking distance.“The property sits amidst extensive, carefully maintained and secluded landscaped gardens and is set far back from the road.“A paved drive allows for parking of multiple vehicles and leads to detached garage.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"news from around the districts august 16 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCowalfest sThe popular Cowalfest walking festival s next month in a more compact form than before.The event offers three days of hill and trail walks right around the beautul Cowal peninsula in September in conjunction with the new Dunoon Outdoor Festival.There will also be the opportunity to enjoy cultural events such as a Clan Lamont heritage walk.Financial constraints and a shortage of volunteers have meant that Cowalfest has been shortened to three days from the -day festival of previous years.

We knew it would last forever, but forever had its day.The Twin Peaks-inspired Love Dilation is as dark as it is atmospheric.But it is perhaps the utterly engrossing simplicity of Imprints that makes it so special.

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace. For the imprints you leave, have changed the fabric of time and space.If there is any justice in the supersonic space-age future, Electron Masss four EPs will hopefully have changed the fabric of

And Scotland is leading the way, with the Scottish government aiming for renewable sources to generate the equivalent of  per cent of Scotlandrsquos gross annual electricity consumption by .To allow us to use more renewable energy we need to upgrade our current system to a smarter energy network.This will ensure we make the most of the greener energy available and open the door to a more sustainable future.With the uptake of smart meters in homes around Great Britain will come a new, smarter system, which is a more flexible and decarbonised. Whatrsquos more, this system is central to the country reducing its CO emissions, whilst being more reliable, sustainable and cost-effective.The increased complexity of the system and the need to be able to flexibly match supply and demand means that digitalisation is an important part of the transition. Central to digitalisation is the accurate measurement of customer energy demands so the system can provide energy in the most efficient and costeffective way, and customers can accurately understand how they use energy. And that is where smart meters ndash available from your energy supplier at no extra cost - come in.Simply put, smart meters will make Britainrsquos energy grid, and energy system, smarter. This is because the data that they are able to generate allows our energy network to understand how much energy is being used, when and where across Great Britain. The system will also be able to draw on more local and renewable sources of energy.Our electricity needs are predicted to double by , so we have to upgrade our outdated energy grid. Just by having a smart meter in your home, yoursquoll be helping the grid to better anticipate demand and reduce waste, readying it to meet the demands of the future.For more information visitsmartenergyGB.orgThe HeraldrsquosClimate for Changeinitiative supports efforts being made by the ScottishGovernmentwith key organisations and campaign partners.

spin no deposit bonuses over the last few years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

Next to it lies the Barras, the famed open-air weekend market. All around are pubs, shops and restaurants. An adult shop sits just opposite.This is a street that stirs all sorts of opinions, some of them fairer than others. \"A walk up the Gallowgate ndash takeaways, pawnshops and Celtic pubs ahoy ndash can feel a bit dicey on occasion, but its all part of the Barrowlands experience,\" an English newspaper noted a few years ago. \"A dingy red-light area of Glasgow,\" one architecture magazine said disapprovingly, back in .An encyclopedia of Scotland notes that Gallowgate retained \"much of its distinctive earthy charm\" despite wholesale demolition and regeneration. \"This part of town is gritty, and a far cry from the historical tenement buildings of the centre, but it gives you a taste of the citys authentic character,\" observed the Dubai-based Business Traveller Middle East in .Relive the Roaring Twenties - The Ivy, Glasgow: restaurant review by Ron MackennaGoing back even further, the Edinburgh-born novelist Naomi Mitchison, in her notes for a post-war novel, wrote impatiently of the Gallowgate: \"Notice how many children you see with obvious rickets, impetigo or heads close clipped for lice see the wild, slippered, sluts, not caring anymore to look decent!\"You get the picture.But things are changing. The area is increasingly home to creative businesses and a new generation of pubs and restaurants.

Over at Calton Entry, the thriving BAaD - Barras Art and Design - includes a fish restaurant, AChalltainn, as well as concerts and a Sunday indoor market.Just next to the Barrowland lies what was once a well-known Celtic pub. Bairds Bar, it was called: here,  years ago, the then interim Celtic manager Kenny Dalglish held one of the more unusual press conferences in the clubs history. Bairds was shut down amid ious well-publicised dficulties in , but recently it was reopened as a restaurant,  Gallowgate, which has been praised by none other than the Herald on Sundays exacting restaurant critic, Joanna Blythman. \"The people who opened  Gallowgate,\" read her concluding paragraph, seem to get old Glasgow, its mood, its character, its value.\"In Bain Street, close by the Barrowland, there is Saint Lukes, a noted live-music venue, and the award-winning Winged Ox Bar  Kitchen.

WEST Brewery, at the Templeton Building on Glasgow Green, has been flying the flag for the east end for  years.Something, it seems, is stirring in the Gallowgate.Cross the road from the Barrowland and, next door to the adult shop youll see another new venture: The Gate, a lounge bar, a \"modern Scottish pub\", the brainchild of Andy Gemmell, a well-known drinks consultant who is also a columnist on the Herald on Sundays Scottish Le magazine.Together with Tom Joyes, general manager of the Barrowland, Gemmell discloses plans to rebrand the area as the East End Quarter - to, in their words, \"create the visual reason for people to visit East and make it a must-visit neighbourhood in Glasgow.\":The  best seaside pubs in ScotlandMore of The Gate first, though. Its hard to miss, with a vivid yellow diagonal stripe across its facade and front door. It occupies a site that, from next year, will have been home to a remarkable succession of Gallowgate watering-holes for  years. Its quite a thought: since , the year of Scotlands short-lived Radical War, locals have been knocking back beer and whisky in industrial quantities in this very space. Its more recent inhabitants included The Haven, and The Emerald Isle.Gemmell, whose CV has seen him work in award-winning bars and travel the world as a whisky ambassador, speaks with some pride of the history of these premises the fact, for example, that when you enter them, youre in the original close of a tenement that once loomed over the Gallowgate, two centuries ago. Faded uncovered signs, advertising long-forgotten businesses that once traded here, can also be glimpsed.Gemmell knows the area well. His previous role ndash the marketing consultancy, The Drink Cabinet ndash was one of the many businesses based round the corner in East Campbell Street, at the Glasgow Collective, whose founders, brothers John and David McBeth, were, he says, the first to bring a creative side to the Gallowgate. .\"Their premise was to bring young, up-and-coming businesses into the area. Its that basic equation that we see, for example, in Hoxton or Shoreditch [in Londons East End] ndash affordable business space for younger people. I fell in love with the area after that. Its had its issues, its troubles and everything , but I just fell in love with it.\"Three years ago this place came up for sale. It was a good price, and I saw the opportunity. Everyone thought I was mad.\" Why  \"Because of its general reputation, which I felt was exaggerated peoples perception of the area was always asthere was an invisible force-field when you get to The Tron [on the other side of Glasgow Cross from the Gallowgate].\"He notes that both the Trongate and the adjacent Merchant City have been flourishing in terms of bars and entertainment, but laments that \"a stigma\" has attached itself to the Gallowgate. \"There are lots of factors that have given rise to this,\" he argues, \"but people have highlighted these rather than looking at the positives of an amazing village in the middle of Glasgow city centre, with amazing people in it as well. Incredible people. I felt the area has what it takes to be an exciting hub for the city,\"The premises were sitting in now were in a neglected condition when he first saw it. There were, for example, six dferent ceilings, all layered one over the other: \"The place,\" he says, \"was like a Russian doll.\"It was only at the start of this year that he finally decided to focus all his energies on turning the space into The Gate. \"People were steering me off, saying, what are you doing, opening a pub in the Gallowgate \" He knows that a more obvious choice would have been Finnieston, the West End or the Merchant City, \"but I just see the potential down here. I see the potential for the area. If there was an actual physical equation of what makes an area, then the closest Ive seen in the UK isnt Shoreditch or Hoxton.

The toasties include chorizo and chilli jam.:Bioersity projects share fund to boost nature in urban areasGemmell insists that \"gentrication\" of the Gallowgate is absolutely the last thing on his mind. \"As soon as I got the keys for this place, the first thing I did was go across the road and introduce myself to every single person I saw, and told them what I was going to do. I know the old-school way in which things work.\"I couldnt be happier with the way things have gone so far. On the opening night recently I had Stevie, from [nearby] Bar  and his we having a cocktail, alongside many local people, all enjoying the atmosphere. Im not here to gentry anything: Im here to highlight what I think is a great area, and hopefully use my travels and my experience to make this place a success.\"\"Weve just got a feeling for the area,\" Tom Joyes says with emphasis in his wood-led office, deep within the Barrowland Ballroom. \"Not just myself, not just Andy, but everyone in the general area.\"Our company, Maggie McIver Ltd, founded the Barras way back in  and opened the ballroom in . In two years time the market will be a hundred years old.\"Now, in all the  years Ive been here, weve always been in a void so far as the ious authorities ndash Glasgow City Council, the GDA [Glasgow Development Agency], the SDA [Scottish Development Agency], you name it.\"Weve never been city centre, weve never been really east end ndash well, we are east end, but nowhere actually in it: its such a vast place. We were neither one thing nor the other. The void was the word that they all seemed to use.In the wider Gallowgate, Joyes observes that what has been evolving \"are entrepreneurs, artistic types, artisans\". Entertainment has improved, too: the ballroom is gaining in fame and worldwide prestige. And he argues that the area is right on the city centres doorstep, not out in a distant scheme.\"Were in this East End quarter,\" he continues. \"I think you should look at the map of Glasgow and should be seeing Finnieston, the West End, Collegelands, the city centre, Merchant City ndash and the East End Quarter. Its all the city centre, sprawling outwards. The sooner we get a recognised address of where we are, the better.\"He foresees a time when the Barras location can be given as the East End Quarter. \"A nice address it spruces it up a wee bit, to go with the nice streets and things like that.\" More: there could be a time when London Road, and businesses currently based at the Templeton building at Glasgow Green, can also say theyre based in the Quarter. \"Everything gains a wee bit value, a wee bit of prestige, a wee bit of credibility, as the whole area is improving.\"Up until a couple of years ago, Joyes confides, the area around the Barras wasnt a place he would have considered visiting for a meal on a Saturday night, but he and his partner have done just that, several times - BAad, Saint Lukes. He recently took some male members of his family on a pub-crawl. \"I told them we were going to the East End Quarter. They said, whats that  The places we visited were all very pleasant.\"Theres CCTV being installed: the place can only become safer. The streets and pavements have been upgraded. The whole area is evolving. Our message is that, of an evening in the entertainment sides, you can go to Merchant City, or the East End Quarter.\"The group behind the plan for an East End quarter brings together many of the influential people, including Joyes and Gemmell, who are reshaping the Gallowgate. Promotional material, shown to The Herald, speaks of an intention to ldquoshowcase the best of hospitality, music and the arts in The East End of Glasgow.It continues: \"Glasgowrsquos East End, [based] around the iconic Barrowland Ballroom, has seen a resurgence over recent years with some great food and drink operators and creatives hustling hard to drive tourism and bring a new focus to the area.\"It is our mission to create a  to showcase these erse venues, the people, music and attractions, to propel Glasgowrsquos East End Quarter into the spotlight as the lsquoplace to gorsquo.\"There will be heavy promotion of #EastEndQuarter across Instagram and Facebook, and, the material says, \"we will create beautul photography, immersive video and styled posts to champion East End Quarter businesses, attractions, art venues, people and more, with a strategic plan that engages stakeholders and visitors.\"Tourism will play a key part. \"There is so much potential for tourism and we will galvanise operators and businesses in the area to collaborate and thrive together.

They came behind the SNP and Plaid Cymru in single seats and behind Labour in seven. But they are the second place challengers to the Tories in .They recently picked up one of those in last monthrsquos Brecon  Radnorshire byelection, but you get the picture.If the LibDems are to build on the momentum of the EU election, in which proportional representation greatly helped them, they must defeat sitting Tory MPs under the much tougher first-past-the-post system.If they help install Mr Corbyn in Downing Street, even for a few days to extend the Brexit deadline and call an election, those incumbent Tories will use that against them at every turn.You can see the posters now. A giant Nicola Sturgeon with a smaller Mr Corbyn in her pocket and Ms Swinson tucked into his, like a set of Russian dolls.The other opposition parties will be making similar calculations about the next election too, of course. But they face less pain than the LibDems.:Humza Yousaf says he struggles with the name of the SNP and its connotationsThe SNP are consistently high in the polls and see little threat from Mr Corbynrsquos plan. Better, they may even get a snf of Indyref. And itrsquos not astheir Tory opponents in the north-east could get even angrier at the Nationalists.Labour meanwhile would love to be able to go into an election with ldquoRe-elect Jeremy Corbyn as a slogan after their leader had had a dry run at the job.So when Mr Corbyn proposed talks on a time-limited government of national unitywith him at the helm, it was understandable that Ms Swinson instantly discounted it as ldquononsense.The Labour leader could never persuade a majority of MPs to support the idea, including many Labour MPs, far less would-be Tory rebels, so it wasnrsquot worth considering, she said.Nor does she trust Mr Corbyn. Besides his endless havering on Brexit, she has said she regards him as a danger to national security and the economy.She may be right about all of the above, but she was still wrong to dismiss it.The proposal is a useful thing per se. It gets the ball-rolling and the parties talking. What,anything, emerges from those talks may be a quite dferent plan. But the main thing for Remainers now is to put a sht in and arrive at a workable scheme. Mr Corbynrsquos invitation to parley has at least got that process underway.It also forces Remainers to face up to the fact that passing a no-confidence vote in Boris Johnsonrsquos government is not sufficient to stop no-deal. You canrsquot spend half a fiver. You need a credible plan to give value to the first part.Indeed, without knowing what comes next, Tory rebels are unlikely to vote no-confidence and end their political careers. If Remainers ever find it, the missing piece may turn out to be a GNU or emergency legislation or some other improbable novelty. No one knows. And so you have to keep all options open.Following that logic, Nicola Sturgeon was right to say she could work with Mr Corbyn to stop no-deal. She later said she wasnrsquot a fan, and would prefer not to start from here, but, hey, needs must.Even Sarah Wollaston, the former Tory MP turned LibDem, accepted the Labour leader may be ldquothe lesser of two evils when set against no-deal.There are a lot of mind games and brinkmanship around no-deal.With his lsquodo or diersquo promise about October , Mr Johnson is trying to create a sense of inevitability about Brexit and instil fatalism in his opponents. The mop-topped Moses hopes theyrsquoll part like the Red Sea and let him bumble into the promised land.Despite leakers reportedly being threatened with the sack, his government keeps leaking tit-bits to reinforce this.

That came after figures showed the town had lost % of its population in  alone.But this one town is just part of a bigger picture.

They want to copy Scotland and its half-century long effort to keep people in the Highlands and Islands.Last week Pedro Saacutenchez, Spainrsquos acting prime minister, took an interest in the scheme at a depopulation summit.Cuenca, along with neighbouring Soria, also in Castilla La Mancha, and Teruel in Aragon, is part of an international network called Southern Sparsely Populated Areas or SSPA.They are joined by a Croatiarsquos biggest county by area, Lika-Senj and Evrytania, a mountainous region of central Greece.

They want to politics-proof re-population.SSPA, funded by the European Union and ious regional governments, produced a major report on the Highlands and Islands.

Fay Vass, the society’s chief executive, said: “We frequently get calls from members of the public who have been watching a hedgehog that’s been lay still in their garden for days.“By the time we get the call and the person gets the hedgehog to rescue, it’s often too late.“Hedgehogs don’t sunbathe. If you see a hedgehog lay still in the open, or with flies round it orit’s struggling to walk properly, it is in urgent need of rescue.”If you find a hedgehog in need of help the society suggest you use gardening gloves or an old towel to collect the animal, placing it inside a high sided cardboard or plastic box with the towel or an old t-shirt in the bottom for it to hide under. Take the box indoors away from flies.If the hedgehog isn’t bleeding, offering a warm wrapped hot water bottle is good first aid, but do make sure there is room for it to get offit gets too warm and ensure the bottle is not allowed to go cold.Offer some meaty cat or dog food and water but don’t force feed it.Once you’ve done that, call a local hedgehog rescue centreyou know of one, or BHPS on    for further advice and local contacts.If it’s a baby, Fay says you should check for siblings.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances that led up to the incident\"  Appeal for information following suspicious fire in Peterhead viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"“Hoglets don’t usually come in ones,” she said. “If a hoglet it is trouble, its brothers and sisters may well need help too, so do look around vicinity for others.” She added: “Acting quickly could literally mean the dference between le and death.

Now we want to reach out to the public and local organisations theand breadth of Scotland to get their feedback.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to consider the new strategy and to join the conversation. “The consultation is available online but we will also be going out to communities across rural, island and urban locations in the next  weeks where it would be great to hear as many views as possible.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Colin points out a wall during the Bennachie dig.\"  Open day for people to see dig at Bennachie viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"The strategy aims to protect our climate as well as meeting the needs of its people and businesses.It’s a fine balancing act but the government believes the strategy will tackle climate change, help the economy prosper and improve our health and well-being. There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Simon Phelps, founder of Fluvial Innovations, which created the award-winning Floodstop barrier, has called for local authorities to look for more effective solutions to deal with flooding across towns and cities.He said: “Following the recent floods and storms, sandbags have been widely used in flood-hit areas, despite the availability of more practical and cost effective solutions. “These measures seem to have more of a placebo effect than any real form of flood protection.“With yet more flood devastation predicted, it’s crucial we use defences that actually work, to protect residents and businesses from losing everything.”Mr Phelps claimed sandbags were ineffective and comparatively expensive to alternatives, considering they can only be used once. Empty sandbag sacks have to be bought and filled, using both manpower and time – two resources in short supply in a flooded area.“Even when they are in position, sandbags are prone to excessive leakage, and when used, bags rot and decay, so they are unusable for future floods,” he said.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Adam Clark, group business sales and development director at Arnold Clark, and Daniel Adams, executive director of Marys Meals UK, join pupils supporting to the charitys Backpack Project helping children in Malawi.\"  Fill your old school backpacks for children in Malawi viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : pmA huge crowd turned out to witness a display of piping perfection on Broad Street this evening.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions by phoning  ,# said those involved.A spokesperson for the project went on to say: “A huge thanks to all the landowners who have helped us by agreeing the essential land access we need to get started. With their support together we can protect Orkney’s unique wildle for future generations.”The traps will be laid around  metres apart in preferred stoat habitat, which may include some road verges. They will be checked regularly by the project staff.The Orkney Native Wildle Project is a partnership between Orkney Islands Council, Scottish Natural Heritageand RSPB Scotland. Following three years of development generous support for the project has been provided by, the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Le, providing a combined grant of £. million for the duration of the five-year project.Stoats are native to the UK Mainland but not to Orkney, where they were first recorded in . Since then the population has increased rapidly and is now fully established and widely-distributed throughout Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay. Those involved said that they are grateful for any sightings of stoats which can be reported via the Stoats in Orkney Facebook page giving a map grid reference.Stoats pose a very serious threat to Orkney#s native wildle particularly the Orkney vole, hen harrier, short-eared owl and other ground nesting birds such as red-throated ers, Arctic terns and curlews for which Orkney is internationally important and upon which Orkney’s thriving wildle tourism industry relies.Keep up to date with the blog ‘Stoat Snippets’, the Orkney Native Wildle Project Facebook page at www.facebook OrkneyNativeWildleProject or visit www.ONWP.orgcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Residents need to be registered to take part in any future elections.Dennis Stevenson, the electoral registration officer for Orkney and Shetland, said: “It’s important that residents respond as soon as they can, so we can make sure we have the right details on the electoral register for every address in Orkney.“If you’re not currently registered, your name will not appear on the form. To make sure you can have your say at future elections, simply check the form you receive and respond as soon as possible.“All responses can now be made online and we would encourage householders, where possible, to use this method rather than ing the form in the post.”People who have changed address recently are particularly encouraged to keep an eye out for the form and check the details.Research by the independent Electoral Commission indicates that recent home movers are far less likely to be registered than those who have lived at the same address for a long period of time.Across the UK,  per cent of people who have been at their property for more than sixteen years will be registered, compared to  per cent of people who have lived at an address for less than a year.Further information about registering to vote is available on the Electoral Commission website at https:www.yourvotematters Any residents who have any questions can contact the Electoral Registration Office at  Broad Street, Kirkwall.

After a public outcry, the hoardings disappeared. This summer a cunning plan worthy of Baldrick was devised. Squeeze the pavement space on the south side of Princes St by cordoning off the bench seats there, so people cannot stand on themand install a huge retractable curtain. However, drawing the curtains cannot hide the mess inflicted by this commercialisation of our “public good” gardens. Last year we were told that the hoardings were necessary for public safety – nothing to do with selling tickets, of course. Granted a free view, crowds would be tempted to gather, and spill off the pavement into the busy roadway, creating an accident risk. This year’s “solution” reduces the pavement space available for pedestrian movement during the most crowded weeks of the year. Result  Where they can, people are walking on the road, exactly the hazard that the hoardings allegedly were devised to avoid. A new eyesore has been created: a promenade now resembles a builder’s yard. This being Festival time, it could be passed off as an elongated piece of installation art. Barricading off space, especially alongside bus stops, maximises crowding, causing pedestrian discomfort and real problems for people with disabilities. But remember, it’s for their safety, not to stop people peeping over at the concert without paying. As a spokesperson said, the concert organisers don’t want “passers-by on Princes Street… to congregate”. How did it come to this  How much more can we expect  In a recent Scotsman articleI explained how senior council officials and political leaders are formally committed to align City Council activity with “decisions made for the benefit of the tourism sector”. A public consultation last year found that  per cent of respondents felt there should be no more than five major events in the gardens in any year. There are nine nights of concerts in Summer Sessions , which run from - August. Last year there were six. How many will there be in   The FLY Open Air Festival raves will set up in West Princes St Gardens on  September, run three shows - September, and be clearing up over the next couple of days. From  October to  November there will be the Oktoberfest tent and live music. Then comes another tickets-only event, Mark Ronson’s Hogmanay in the Gardens, with time either side to set up and de-rig. All these damage the grass, which takes time to recover. In contrast, the annual Festival fireworks concert in the gardens happens one night a year, with free and safe viewing from a closed Princes St, and really does need the castle as its backdrop.There is a place for pop concerts and other live music events in Edinburgh. It’s just not Princes St Gardens. Surveys repeatedly show that it is the tranquillity and green space that people love about this city centre oasis, in other words the fact that they are a garden. That means there is a strong case for staging concerts somewhere . The main counter-argument is that the gardens enhance the concert experience, and draw big names who otherwise would not come to Edinburgh. Really  Performing with your back to the castle can’t be that dferent to doing a gig in any other city. Do performers take a cut in their fee just to play in the gardens  If so, is that passed on in the ticket price, or to the council There has been talk of dispersing the Edinburgh Festival and Fringe around the city. Big open air music events are the opportunity to kick-start this. They would have the critical mass to draw other events to cluster near them. Look for a site near the tramlines, to boost sustainable transport. Connect it to a training academy for music industry jobs, and begin to spread the benefits. Free concerts in such a venue could make Edinburgh more inclusive: Bryant Park in Manhattan has daily events open to everyone – no barriers, no hoardings! It can be done.

It might not be a perfect solution but it#s something and, good God, don#t we need something, now Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s proposal that rival politicians should join him in a bid to bring down Prime Minister Boris Johnson and then replace the Conservative administration with a government of national unity looks, at first glance, like a viable alternative to the no-deal Brexit towards which the United Kingdom is now hurtling.Once this wheeze had been enacted, Prime Minister Corbyn would do two things: he’d secure a delay to the UK’s departure from the EU and then call a general election. Labour would campaign for a second referendum, including the option to Remain.But desperation clouds the judgment, does it not  What might seem an imperfect but workable solution to the crisis in which the UK now finds itself is, I’m afraid, anything but.So ided is the nation over the decision, taken by voters in the  referendum, to leave the EU that an administration cobbled together by Labour, the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and ious Europhile Tories would have no more claim to be a government of national unity than the one currently led by Johnson. Even the most ardent Remainer must see this, surely  Corbyn’s proposal is already in tatters, anyway, thanks to the Lib Dems. The Labour leader will be pleased by this outcome.Not unreasonably, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson reacted to Corbyn’s suggestion of a coalition to thwart No Deal by pointing out that he is not likely to be able to command the support of a majority of MPs. There are, she said, Labour MPs who would struggle to back their leader to become prime minister.The Green MP Caroline Lucas and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon were among those who seized the opportunity to attack Swinson for her position. At this point it was abundantly clear precisely what was going on.The Lib Dem have been enjoying something of a revival in their fortunes of late. Coalition with the Conservatives between - might have looked asit had finished off the party but its clear and unwavering opposition to Brexit has made it an attractive proposition for voters who despair at the result of the  referendum.This Lib Dem revival stands to hurt Corbyn’s Labour Party which has – until the leader’s sudden burst of energy last week – been pitully weak on the subject of the UK’s departure from the EU.Corbyn, a prominent Eurosceptic for most of his parliamentary career, has hummed and hawed over the question of a second referendum, even as members of his party urge him to do whatever is necessary to stop Brexit in its tracks.Corbyn has tried – and failed – to ride both the horses of Remain and Leave since . The pitul spin goes that the Labour leader’s aim was to reunite a nation torn apart by Brexit. The truth was that he was perfectly satisfied with the result of the EU referendum.But the Corbyn “strategy” has created a space for the Lib Dems. Just as the Scottish Tories established themselves as the party of the Union after the  independence referendum, so the Lib Dems have become the party of Europe since .This truth is behind Corbyn’s proposal to establish a government of national unity. Of course, Swinson was going to have to reject the idea that she might play a part in making Corbyn prime minister. And, of course, Labour was then going to use her response to allege that  she isn’t really serious about stopping a no-deal Brexit, and  she is perfectly happy to prop up Johnson’s premiership.Corbyn’s plan was an unavoidable elephant trap. Sturgeon’s reaction to Swinson’s refusal to countenance a Corbyn premiership was as cynical as the Labour leader’s call for unity. The nationalists have been consistent in their opposition to Brexit but for Scots who oppose both independence and Brexit, the Lib Dems look like a reasonable option.Sturgeon, then, has nothing to lose – and, possibly, something to gain – from painting Swinson as a Boris Johnson enabler. This sort of thing may be useful in, say, a by-election such as the one forthcoming in Shetland, where the Lib Dems face a strong challenge from the SNP.There is, of course, another reason that Sturgeon would be happy to see Corbyn in  Downing Street. The Labour leader has recently said that he believes it should not be the place of the UK government to stand in the way of a second independence referendum. If the SNP was to play a part in installing him as PM, the First Minister’s price would surely be agreement to another independence referendum at a time of her choosing.Swinson may be opposed to a Corbyn premiership but she is not opposed to trying to bring down Johnson. Her suggestion that either the father or mother of the house – Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman – could fill the role of caretaker PM is surely reasonable.The truth, I’m afraid, is that a government of national unity is simply not a goer. An attempt by Remainer MPs to force another election would unleash a furious response among the Leave voting majority of voters. It would confirm their belief that an elite is working against them and they would punish them accordingly. The next house of Commons would, I believe, be a far more right-wing place.If Corbyn had ever cared about the consequences of Brexit, he’d have campaigned hard for a Remain vote in  rather than sitting on his hands, he’d have come out fighting for a second referendum at the first whf of impropriety from the winning campaign, and he’d have remained open-minded about who might lead a temporary government in the event that Boris Johnson was toppled.Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t care about protecting the vulnerable from Brexit. He cares only about preserving his own failing leadership.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"i ve got a theory about conspiracy theorists kevan christie","story":"Jeffrey Epstein#s death was suicide  A lone gunman killed JFK    was achieved by  hijackers armed like s football casuals  Some things are too hard to believe, particularly for damaged inudals raised on a litany of lies about Santa and heaven, writes Kevan Christie .Conspiracy theories are back in the news this week and don’t we love ’em.Anyone who’s been following the death of disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein can easily smell a rat, given his links to our very own Prince Andrew and US President Donald Trumpet.I’m sure in the weeks ahead it will come as no surprise to learn of ‘deep state’ involvement stretching back all the way to our very own Royal family in Epstein’s supposed suicide in his Manhattan jail cell, while awaiting trial for sex-trafficking of children. No doubt our very own Prince Philip will have been pulling the strings, emboldened from ordering the security service to make the deaths of our very own Diana, the People’s Princess, and Dodi Fayed look like an ‘accident’ back in . Dedicated conspiracy theorists understand this, to suggest otherwise is akin to being seen out with your best mate who’s wearing an ‘I’m with this Idiot’ t-shirt. Duh.However, there comes a point in everyone’s le, say around the age of , where you have to put down the joint and the beef-flavoured Monster Munch and leave the conspiracy theories to the likes of Netflix.: : It’s great fun discussing who shot JFK with your mates , be it down the boozer or in the comfort of your own home, after the Wall’s Viennetta has been served with Simply Red playing gently in the background.But in my experience these types of encounters can often act as a social tell, like a poor poker player giving their hand away. If without really noticing it, the conversation veers from fake moon landings towards “the Rothschilds control everything” or “MI rigged the  Indy referendum” then chances are you’ve got a KP nutter on your hands and next time it might be besttheir homemade lasagne stays at home with them. Gently guide them on their way as you hand back the six cans of Kestrel Super Premium Lager they brought. Bless. Be seeing ya. This kind of nonsense can easily creep in to these types of chats and all too often goes largely unchecked.Without wanting to sound overly harsh, you’re definitely a bit of a saddoyou’re still hankering after conspiracy theories to explain why le hasn’t quite panned out the way you expected by the time you’ve hit your s. Stuck in a boring - office job, we, kids and the boss doing your nut in, drinking a wee bit too much and not clearing the overdraft Easy, that’s the fault of shadowy elites who have infiltrated HR, ensuring that only young people who understand the bloody computers and something called ‘digital’ get promoted. Yip, the deep state has genuinely conspired to stop you – Rab fi Leith – from getting oan in the world. Pass the herb.Most of the ‘really good’ conspiracy theories come from the US and are borne out of people’s fears and a desire to understand the basic question: how could that happen They often evolve from a perceived failing of the state to protect, be it the le of a president or a politician in the case of JFK or his brother Robert who were both gunned down in their prime. It feels like our personal security has been compromised in some way. The   terrorist attacks are a great example of how conspiracy theories evolve. In this case, they range from a controlled demolition contributing to the collapse of the Twin Towers caused by government insiders to the bringing down of the mysterious World Trade Center  building which housed the CIA and Secret Service – as part of a cover-up to hide state complicity in the attacks. And United Airlines Flight  was shot down by fighter jets before it could reach the White House.In this conspiracy-driven environment, hundredsnot thousands of eye-witness accounts are pushed aside in favour of a narrative chosen by those who spend too much time sitting in their Y-fronts browsing the internet.The desire to push the truth to one side in this instance seems overwhelming for some. Nineteen hijackers armed with nothing more than craft knives – or Stanley knives like the football casuals of the s – hijacked, then weaponised three out of four planes, murdering around , people in the richest, most powerful country in the world. The knock-on effect of this was two wars – one in Iraq, which had as much to do with the   attacks as Iceland – at a total cost that is still running into the trillions. It’s no surprise some folk embrace conspiracy theory alternatives when the truth, as was the case on  September, , is so shocking to accept.The list of conspiracy theories is endless, a shopping list of bampottery from the Flat Earth Society to anti-vaccination types, global warming deniers and everything in between. Believers clearly haven’t got over being lied to as kids and I do have a modicum of sympathy with this. From our first steps, we’re fed a constant stream of lies, designed to regulate our behaviour – Santa will take you off his list, look what the the tooth fairy has brought in the middle of the night, and the police will come and take you away to the school for bad boys.In this environement, it’s no wonder some ‘damaged people’ seek their own alternative truth. I have my own conspiracy theory that has come to me in recent days and it goes like this.The Queensferry Crossing isn’t really a bridge at all but a spaceship from another planet that has crash landed in the Firth of Forth.

Tom wants a just transition, but maximum extraction of fossil fuels is simply incompatible with keeping the global temperature down to a level that is safe.“Tom talks about transitioning jobs, but to secure and grow green jobs like the ones he and I have, we need to start that transition from oil and gas now.“The climate emergency requires us to look at the science and be responsible about this. That doesn’t mean suddenly turning off the oil supply, but it does mean we need to start building for the future now, not waiting until we’ve extracted every last drop of oil.”Scottish Green candidate Debra Nicolson said she was #pleased Tom Wills recognises the climate emergency, but Shetland needs to start building a sustainable future and create new jobs, not rely on a dwindling resource that is damaging the planet.“The SNP can talk about a just transition, but they need to back it up with action. Whatever his personal values, as an SNP backbencher Tom will be whipped to vote for maximum fossil fuel extraction and continuous growth in high-carbon transport.“If elected, I’ll push for a Scottish Green New Deal that will secure our future.”OMG! Greens are jolly cross! Tom Wills “climate emergency” isn’t #emergency# enough  Yet the SNP’s “ net zero” policy is only five years behind ‘Extinction Rebellion’, the ‘far-Green’, extremist group dedicated to replacing Parliament with a #National Assembly of Citizens#, selected by a team of “professionals”.Presumably then, Debra Nicolson and the Greens’ policy is in line with Extinction Rebellion’s  Extinction Rebellion’s goals and methods are explained in leader Roger Hallam’s booklet “Common Sense for the st Century”, free, online:: #After failing to make an impression with Martin Luther King going to jail ….. the idea was hatched to involve the city’s children and young people in an ongoing escalation …….involved thousands of pupils and students leaving school to illegally march through the centre of the city.”“Decades of segregation policies were overturned in a week.

Good, reliable and accessible transport links are of vital importance to our communities,# said Ms Wishart.“From the delivery of the air discount scheme to securing funding in the Scottish Government budget for internal ferry services and leading the campaign for cheaper ferry fares, I am proud of the Liberal Democrat record. In stark contrast, the SNP have failed to deliver on their promises and introduced parking charges at Sumburgh.“It is totally unacceptable for SNP ministers to hold our leline services at ransom. We need a change, and my five-point plan sets out a positive alternative for Shetland that would make the real dference that local people deserve.“As a matter of good faith, SNP ministers should listen to local demands and take all the money they have failed to spend on cheaper ferry fares over the last  months and recycle it into Shetland services. To choose not to would speak volumes about their priorities.”Responding to Ms Wishart#s comments, SNP candidate Tom Wills said: “Voters may remember the -point plan to slash travel costs that I published over two weeks ago. The dference between my plan, and what the Lib Dems have published today, is that I’ll be working with the Scottish Government to implement my proposals # instead of making demands from the side-lines while refusing to take part in budget talks.“I’ve already taken the opportunity to push these plans with government ministers and it’s clear they are ready for fresh ideas to support these islands.“The SNP has delivered a % discount on flights and nearly £ million for mainland ferries since . The money SIC receives to run these services has historically been determined by the local government distribution formula # this was the case when the Lib Dems were in office.

While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

Fans will be treated to singles Feel the Raindrops, Your Greatest Shade of Blue and s classic Broken Land – the ‘most played song on Radio ’ during that particular year. With just over two weeks to go until they tak the stage, songwriter Pat Gribben told the Andersonstown News that he along with the rest of the band are “looking forward” to the August  gig. “Of course it’s always nice to be asked,” said Pat, “I’m looking forward to catching up with Brian Kennedy. I played guitar with Brian and haven’t seen him since his illness and now that he is cancer free, it will be good to see him.”On composing one of the most iconic songs of the s, Broken Land, Pat explained how he had been “messing about” on producer Garry Bell’s keyboards. “I got my daughter to school that Monday morning and the main part of the song was done that day,” he said.Still heavily rotated on airwaves  plus years later, Pat said there are lots of songs written that could appear on a new Adventures album. “I think we are playing better now than back in the day, I don’t know why, maybe we are all more experienced. I’d like to put a new album out and give the people that come to see, that are coming to see us, that new work, new material to sing along to.”Pat spoke of how the band are already looking to  with a series of gigs already lined up. “I have a lot of material and it’s a matter of putting it all down and getting it out there. There is a great studio in Antrim, Einstein Studios, and that’s where we will go to do the work. “We have the Empire Music Hall booked for January and the Forever Young festival in Dublin.

From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level. I cannot wait to try some of the other small plates which include spicy Italian meatballs, crab bruscietta and sweet potato bhajis. The main plates were mighty fine too and maybe with a cocktail or two the next time. I am already looking forward to planning my next lunchtime visit to the Antrim Road’s famous stalwart. The Lansdowne is back with a bang – and so is quality food in North Belfast.The Lansdowne Hotel Antrim Rd, Belfast, BT EFTel:    www.thelansdownehotel"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland couple create stunning sea of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The businesses in Portglenone are delighted as its brought a lot more people into the town.\"It doesnt take that long to sow the seeds,\" said Damian, who works at the local DLF Seeds company and knows what it takes to bring the field to le. \"It was just a couple of hours of walking up and down shaking the fiddle, but after that its out of your hands as to whether everything comes good.\"This year Damien and Karen, with their three children Cara , Ryanand Therese , have crafted another masterpiece. Visitors are greeted by scenes reminiscent of a Monet impressionist painting with a touch of Van Gogh, all on the edge of Seamus Heaney country.\"We live in a very green country with lots of rolling meadows, but people seem to like a splash of colour too. Its dferent and we like to think its a very romantic setting,\" said Damien. \"We had three marriage proposals in the field last year, wedding parties coming for photographs, plenty of fashion photo shoots, buses stopping off on tours of the country and, of course, plenty of photographers. There were also a couple of music videos filmed.\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Its so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\"Thats an added bonus this year, with a neighbour lending an extra acre-sized field where Damian has created the perfect haven for butterflies, and when work commitments allow, he is only too happy to take visitors on a guided walk through the wildflowers.\"Its worked so well,\" he said. \"Were getting plenty of guests! \"Weve seen some of the rarer types, like painted ladies and peacocks. Youd almost think they were looking at you as the patterns on the wings resemble eyes. Its lovely to see them coming into their natural habitat.\"Obviously were relying a lot on the weather, but its been warm enough so far this year to allow the sunflowers to come out. They are a tropical plant, so heavy rain can take its toll, but theyve survived so far andwe can manage to get a couple of decent sunny days, even more of them should come out. Were at around % right now, and they thrive on direct sunlight.\"Karen and her kids, plus an army of young people from the town, have all been roped in to keep the meadow in tip top shape, and she expects the field to be open to the public for the next few weeks.\"Obviously theres a limited time span for when the sunflowers are in bloom, soanyone does want to take a stroll through, forget all about everyday le and lose themselves in a natural world, the next two to three weeks will be the best time to experience it,\" she said.\"In the meantime, were only too happy to have people as our guests, bring a picnic or a flask of tea and enjoy it while it lasts.\"This year, Damien and Karen are raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. Entry is £ or £ for  to -year-olds. Under s go free. The field is open Monday to Saturday, am-pm and Sunday, am-pm."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was followed by St Kevins College in Enniskillen in st place with .%, and, both in joint nd place, St Catherines College in Armagh and St Michaels College in Enniskillen with .%.Dalriada School headmaster Tom Skelton said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the results.\"Its a fantastic achievement for the staff and pupils involved,\" he said. \"To take every child over the line with % five A*-C represents a lot of hard work and the support of parents as well.\"Two years ago we were % as well, so were delighted to get up there again. I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

After he trained as an architect and engineer, he was apprenticed to the Derry building firm of George and Robert A. Ferguson. He later set up his own practice in the city and at a young age was responsible for large projects in Omagh, Coleraine and other towns.Amongst the projects he oversaw in his native city were the Corporation waterworks at Creggan and was he was also associated to the layout of Foyle College grounds for building purposes. But amongst Barkers main projects was designing a shirt factory for David Hogg and Charles Mitchell at Sackville Street in Derry. He had also been heavily involved in the project to build the new Presbyterian |Church at Burt, Co Donegal in the mid-s.Constructed in , Hogg  Mitchell’s shirt factory almost immediately won a highly lucrative contract when it became the supplier of shirts for the British Army during the Boer War . The company founded the ‘Old England’ line of shirts which later became the globally known ‘Peter England’ brand. It continued to manufacture shirts in Derry until the s and the façade of Barker’s building still exists today as the building was converted into an apartment block in .Tragedy struck William Barker when in late  he fell off a horse and never recovered consciousness before his death at the young age of  on May , .He left a widow, Maryand three children-Mary Violet Barker, Thomas McCurdy Baker and William Alexander his namesake at his home at Orchard Street in the centre of the city.While William Snr undoubtedly left his professional mark even at such a young age on his native city, it was his son Thomas who lived a truly fascinating le having borne bearing personal witness and suffered as a result of one of the most decisively brutal acts of the Second World War.Thomas McCurdy Barker was born in , was a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. He was the first full-time secretary of the Irish Christian Movement, the convenor and organiser of the  conference ‘Ireland’s Hope’, the proceedings of which he edited, and from the s a missionary and professor of New Testament Greek at Mukden in the Chinese province of Manchuria.The Second Sino-Japanese War was fought between the Republic of China and The Empire of Japan between July  and September . China fought Japan with the aid of the Soviet Union and the USA, but after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in  the conflict became immersed in WWII and a result became the largest conflict in Asia during the twentieth century.The war between China and Japan was the result of a decades long Japanese imperialist policy to expand its influence both politically and militarily in order to secure access to raw materials, food and labour.Internecine warfare in China also provided strong opportunities for Japan who viewed Manchuria as almost limitless supply of raw materials, a market fot its manufactured goods and a protective buffer against the Soviet Union in Siberia.Japan invaded Manchuria in September  after what bacame known as the Mukden Incident. It was an event staged by Japanese military personnel as a pretext for a full invasion.On September , Lieutenant Suemori Kawamoto detonated a small quantity of dynamite close to a rail line owned by Japans South Manchuria Railyway near Mukden. The explosion was so weak that it failed to destroy the track, but it was enough to allow the Imperial Japanese Army to accuse Chinese dissident with causing it and as a result they invaded and occupied Manchuria, establishing a puppet state called Manchukuo after five months of incessant fighting. The Japanese even installed Chinas last Emperor, Puyi as the ruler to try and lend legitimacy to thwe situation.The invasion of the whole of China came six years later in July  when Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo Bridge-an access route to Bejing. As the conflict became merged into WWII, the Japanese began imprisoning people in concentration camps and amongst these was Rev Thomas McCurdy Barker who was incarcerated for the duration of the war at Nagasaki.On the day of the U.S nuclear strike on August ,  the population of Nagasaki was estimated to be ,. There were , Japanese residents, , Korean residents, , conscripted Korean workers, , Japanese soldiers,  conscripted Chinese workers and  Allied POWs.A Boeing B- Superfortress plane called Bockscar, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, took off just before dawn carrying a plutonium bomb code named Fat Man.The initial target was the city of Kokura, but it was obscured by cloud and smoke, so the Americans turned their attention to their secondary target-Nagasaki. But, it too was covered by cloud. Running short of fuel, the plane encircled the city several times and it was decided to use radar to drop the device. But, at the last moment the cloud cleared and the bomb was dropped on the citys Urakami Valley-midway between the Mitshubishi Steel and Arms plant in the south and the Mitsubhisi-Urakami Ordnace works in the north.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe plane had arrived over Nagasaki at .am and just under a minute after it was released it exploded at .am at an altitude of approximately , ft.

Amongst the casualties were , of the , employees of of the Mitsubhisi arms plant and , more factory workers at ious other sites. These included , Koreans and  Japanese soldiers.Industrial damage at Nagasaki was high and left between -% of industrial production destroyed. The attack came three days after the first nuclear bomb had been dropped on Hiroshoma, but the Nagasaki device was more powerful than the first bomb but because the city was surrounded by hilly terrain there was less damage.In , another Irish prisoner who also witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki. This was Dr Aidan MacCarthy, a medic in the RAF from County Cork who wrote: “Then there followed a blue flash, accompanied by a very bright magnesium-type flare which blinded them. Then came a frighteningly loud by rather flat explosion which was followed by a blast of hot air.“Some of this could be felt even by us as it came through the shelter openings, which were very rarely closed owing to poor ventilation.“We all genuinely thought, for some time, that this was the end of the world.”Amongst his fellow prisoners was a community of Catholic nuns to whom in the absence of a priest Rev McCurdy ministered to every day-an act which was later recognised when he received thanks from Pope Pius XII when he learned of the Derry mans actions after the war.Also there was Ann Barker, the Rev Thomas second we, who as a medical doctor also practised her profession during her imprisonment at Nagasaki. Her expertise is credited with helping her husband continue to live a rich le in his later retirement despite the effects that the bomb had on his physique.Lilian McCombe was a school teacher at the Presbyterian station at Mukden where she had lived and worked since .In  she wrote: “That chapter of my le closed with the attack by Japan on Pearl Harbour on December , . From that date, I with some  other colleagues were under Japanese jurisdiction. The greater part of the intervening years were spent in internment camps in the cities of Kobe and Nagasaki.“After a non-stop voyage of around three weeks via the Pacic Ocean, I was welcomed in the USA by my brother James, staying several days with the family there. The old Queen Elizabeth, then a troop ship brought me to Southampton, next day to be greeted by my family and later, by a host of friends!“Following a period of ing health, I was eventually led back into teaching until retirement age was reached.”The horrendous experience of imprisonment and a nuclear attack however did not appear to dissuade Rev Barker from giving up on his mission or other duties in Manchuria. Thomas, also it seems had the ear of the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong. And, despite the all encompasing rise of communism in China, he was allowed to continued teaching up until  when the leader of the Peoples Republic of China could no longer guarantee his safety-but Thomas Barker remained in contact with Mao Zedong up until shortly before his death.The cleric was -years-old when he ed to Ireland and was appointed as minister to the Presbyterian Church in Donegal town in  where he remained in service until .In recognition of his missionary service and his undoubted capabilities as a pastor the Church made him Moderator of the Presbyterian Church between - and his alma mater, Trinity College made awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree. When he passed away in , aged  Rev Dr Thomas McCurdy Barker was buried at Castlerock in Co Derry.His father William, mother Mary who died in  and his brother, also a Presbyterian minister, Rev William Alexander Barker who passed away in  are buried in Derry City Cemetery.CAPTION: The mushroom cloud over the Japanese city of Nagasaki after the USA detonated an atomic bomb there on August , . "},{"url":null,"title":"derry search operation linked dissident republican activity","story":"The PSNI has said that search operation at a building site in Derry was part of an investigation into dissident republican activity.Detectives from the Terrorism Investigation Unit carried out the search at the former Nazareth House residential home in the Bishop Street area.Police cordoned off the district at the Sunbeam Terrace area in lower Bishop Street which includes a local primary school and Lumen Christi grammar school where students today collected examination results.

He brushed aside two weak challenges in the YC box before firing past Carberry.Within less than a minute it was -.A superb run and cross from Rice was laid off by Neale to the onrushing Thomas Healy and he steered the ball into the corner of Walshrsquos net for his first goal for Killyleagh.Killyleagh were struggling to deal with Olympicrsquos pace in attack, with Molloy in particular causing problems and it took a fine save from Carberry in the th minute to keep out the wingerrsquos curling shot.From the resultant corner Olympicrsquos two big central defenders combined, with Paul Dickson outjumping Macaulay Foster to head back for Jason Noade to head in and make it -.The second half was only four minutes old when Olympic had strong penalty appeals waved away by the referee when McClean went down in the box under a challenge from McConnell.Two goals inside two minutes shortly after the hour mark seemed to have killed the game.Nathan Jones was having his best ever game at The Showgrounds with Killyleagh struggling to cope with his pace when he switched to the left wing in the second half.When he was left one on one with YC sweeper Niall Walsh in the st minute he put on the after burners and delivered a beauty of a finish past Carberry.Ballynahinchrsquos fourth goal, two minutes later, was stunning. A superb team goal passing across the fullof the pitch, orchestrated by Stephen Noade and involving Jones, ended in a YC defender putting into his own net.Killyleagh, though, refused to throw the towel in and when their stand-out player, Rice, yet again exposed a vulnerability on the flanks, his inch-perfect cross was bravely turned in by Neale in the th minute.This was the spark for Killyleaghrsquos best spell of the game with Rice giving width and McConnell the creator and Jamie Sharvin linking up play.Walsh somehow kept out with his feet Jamie Sharvinrsquos nd minute effort from Healyrsquos pass and then three minutes later he gratefully ped on Jamie Sharvinrsquos close range shot under pressure from another Rice cross.The big crowd was getting value for the entrance fee now and Walsh underlined his Amateur League representative reputation by producing a supering save from Ricersquos cross to cut out the danger in the th minute.Olympic were content to hit on the break by this stage and substitute Aaron McClean went close with a header before the visitors delivered the ultimate sucker punch.A stunning pass from deep allowed Jones to race through and Dalton Tate delivered the finish in the nd minute.But still the game wasnrsquot finished. Rice powered down the line yet again and once more producing a teasing cross which Neale thumped in.It was now -. At the opposite end Shane Murray blasted over the bar when he was played through by Jones and then Killyleagh thought they had pulled it back to - to set up a grandstand finish when Nealersquos shot was spilled and Dylan Kelly rled home, but the referee ruled he had been in an offside position when the initial shot was delivered.No one was leaving early and at this rate, there will be plenty looking to book their place for thematch later in the season.By then, Olympic will hope they have further underscored that they are the team best equipped this season to challenge Crumlin Starrsquos stranglehold on the premier title..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sharon stars on Angela’s day  ","story":"LADY luck shone down on Angela Kenmore for her Lady Captainrsquos Day at St Patrickrsquos Golf Club on Saturday.A welcome window in the weather meant that the ladies escaped the dayrsquos frequent deluges and almost miraculously went round rain free.Heavy showers early in the morning had put the competition under threat and the afternoon downpours meant that Mrs Kenmorersquos male guests got a soaking.But not aof rain fell on the ladies, who also had the benefit of not having to play out of the water-logged bunkers.Despite the weather prediction, there was a great turnout and a thrilling finish.Sharon Heaney and Anne Teggart finished tied at the top of the leaderboard with  points, but it was Sharon who took the Lady Captainrsquos prize thanks to a better back nine.With Anne having to settle for the runners-up spot, third place went to Patricia McCormick, who came in with  points.The prize for the best gross went to Caitlin Burke who beat Twyla Gibson on the better back nine after they both ed a score of .The front nine prize went to Mary Rice with  points and Orlagh Carson won the back nine prize with  points.Anne Savage won the past lady captainsrsquo prize with  points and Alison Rooney won the committee prize with  points.Nearest the pin prizes were won by Margaret Willis , Caitlin Burke , Jackie Elliottand Patricia McCormick .Gerry Gray won the lady guestsrsquo prize with  points and Brendan Mullen won the male guestsrsquo prize with  points.The Lady Captainrsquos mixed greensomes competition on Thursday was won by vice-captain Robert McCausland and past lady captain Eileen Mullen with  points mdash one point better than runners-up Ryan Teggart and Carmel Hanvey.Nearest the pin prizes were won by Anne Tumeltyand John Passmore ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Taking porridge and exercise are Roddy’s secrets to long life  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new centenarian, Roderick Maguire, says his secret to a long le is his daily bowl of porridge.The former master painter says he still has porridge every morning which he makes for himself at his Thomas Russell Park home.Mr Maguire, better known as Roddy, turned  nearly two weeks ago on August .He received the customary congratulatory card from the Queen as well as a letter from Irish President Michael DHiggins and euro, mdash a special financial bounty known as the Centenarian award.Mr Maguire was treated to a special reception in St Patrickrsquos Church after parish priest Fr John Murray said a special mass for him on his birthday.His family gathered at Quoile Bistro the next night to have a family reunion, which included children and grandchildren who travelled over from Doncaster in England.With his first we Betty, who sadly died many years ago, he had four children mdash Rory, Joan, Anne and Niall.

When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns hot-dogs Upcoming events in conjunction with Local Authorities are:Shambles Market, Armagh, on August Peoples Park, Ballymena, on August Carnfunnock Park, Larne, on August Celebrating business excellence at awards Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"MIDU | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"MIDU | Article Teaser\"Bangor on August , and,St Columb’s Park, Derry, on August .If you would like to attend one of the ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events, get in touch with Dogs Trust’s Campaigns team in Northern Ireland via email campaigns.ni@dogstrust.org.uk or by calling .try catch  TrendingMankilled in two vehicle road traffic collision -

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

While an operator for the hotel has not yet been announced, the group has developed a series of Holiday Inn hotels across the UK and Ireland, as well as Seraphine hotels.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute.

For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster business top  launch ","story":"Posted on Wednesday  August  by Ulster Business Sarah Little, publishing director, INM NI, Mark Thompson, AL Goodbody with John Mulgrew The cream of Northern Ireland’s business community have gathered to mark the official launch of the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies , with AL Goodbody.
