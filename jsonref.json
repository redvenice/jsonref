But in the end, they won\u0027t be able to carry out their threats.\u0027Ministers are also facing pressure to allow face coverings to be worn in schools by some students.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has said masks for older pupils \u0027should be considered\u0027. Government guidance says face coverings are not required as pupils and staff are mixing in consistent groups.They also point out that masks are likely to have a huge impact on communication and learning. Children with hearing problems would find lip-reading impossible.But the NASUWT teachers\u0027 union wants the Department for Education to revise its guidance \u0027as a matter of urgency\u0027 to help staff return with \u0027confidence\u0027.Meanwhile, Business Secretary Alok Sharma admitted ministers were looking at local lockdowns, which could mean schools closing on a \u0027case-by-case basis\u0027.But MPs warned Britain faces \u0027economic armageddon\u0027 unless children go back to class.Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: \u0027The Government has got to recognise that there is not only one risk in the world called Covid: Economic armageddon is coming down the track.\u0027It will result in far more people dying than ever would from Covid and will see the economy going completely flat.\u0027Schools are vital to getting the economy going because unless they open, parents can\u0027t get back to work.\u0027There\u0027ll be a tsunami of unemployment if we are not careful. \u0027Ministers have got to be much clearer: Schools have got to reopen – there must be no backsliding on this.\u0027The poll of over 1,000 Mumsnet users also found that children who were able to return to school for a period before the summer break found it beneficial. Some 77 per cent said their child was happy to be back, including 94 per cent of parents of children in reception.Among parents whose children have not yet returned to school at all, 75 per cent say that supporting home learning has been stressful.Mumsnet founder and chief executive Justine Roberts said: \u0027The final third of this academic year has been astonishingly stressful for students, teachers and parents alike.\u0027It\u0027s great to see that parents are largely confident in schools\u0027 plans for coping with these strange new circumstances, and that most children who had some sort of a return to school were happy to go back.\u0027It\u0027s clear, though, that parents of pupils who face public exams next summer are wary and anxious about what will happen, given that so much teaching time has been irrevocably lost.\u0027The survey came after the Children\u0027s Commissioner for England argued schools should be kept open ahead of pubs or shops.Anne Longfield said children were \u0027an afterthought\u0027 during the first lockdown and young people must be \u0027at the heart\u0027 of tackling a resurgence of the virus. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2746affa9c3129df402d5cf7b5bb779dd1abdb53/85_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfda914b85ce5cbf83d8dd22bd6b94c8","title":"es devlin and machiko weston i saw the world end review","story":"Imperial War Museum onlineMarking 75 years since the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, stage designers Es Devlin and Machiko Weston have made a film of immense power – but it won’t be seen as it was meant to We live in an age that is morally confused. Someone with more sensitivity than sense has cancelled the scheduled screenings in Piccadilly Circus today and on Sunday morning of Es Devlin and Machiko Weston’s thoughtful and moving film to commemorate the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 75 years ago. The piece, commissioned by the Imperial War Museum, was to have been shown on the giant Piccadilly Lights screen but has now been relocated to the museum’s website, “Out of respect for the suffering caused to the people of Lebanon by the recent explosion in Beirut.” But surely it does not in any way disrespect the victims of Beirut’s terrible accident to remember those killed, maimed and poisoned in a calculated act of war in 1945.We have a particular responsibility to remember Hiroshima and Nagasaki because Britain played a big part in bringing about this world-changing moment of destruction. Devlin and Weston have created a sombre chorus of voices, written and spoken, above and below a bright white explosive pulse across a dark screen. It starts with the English father of science fiction HG Wells imagining a supreme conquest of energy in his 1913 work The World Set Free and continues with physicist Leo Szilard’s recollection of how he conceived the atomic bomb “on a dismal grey London morning in September 1933, as I waited for a traffic light at Southampton Row.”The very idea of using bombs from the air to destroy cities is distinctively British. When the nation stood alone in western Europe against the Nazi war machine in the early 1940s, the only way to strike Germany was from the air. This led to bombing raids that became ever more ambitious until by 1943 the RAF discovered how to use a combination of incendiaries and explosives to consume a city in an firestorm. The fire bombing of Hamburg killed over 40,000 people. That defies imagination nearly as much as the casualty figures for the two atom bombs.So why do the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki stand alone in memory when they were in fact the culmination of a strategy of causing the mass deaths of civilians? It is because history changed its nature, life on earth became forever different, in a single flash of light and heat. That’s why Devlin and Weston call their piece I Saw the World End. While western voices describe the gestation of the atomic bomb, those of its victims capture the unique experience of living through this instant. “My surroundings turned blindingly white, like a million camera flashes going off at once. Then, pitch darkness,” remembers Yasujiro Tanaka, who survived the raid on Nagasaki. Sueko Hada describes emerging from a shelter in Hiroshima to see a world utterly changed and morning become twilight.These words are screened in a subtly paced flow like a tragic chorus. But the “western” quotes get more unsettling. There’s a lot of historical substance here. As theatre and opera designers, Devlin and Weston are used to working with complex texts and ideas: their title is a reference to Wagner’s Ring. They don’t strike an attitude. Instead they offer genuine insight from their research. Devlin tracked down the texts in English while Weston found and translated those in Japanese. They worked remotely from each other during the lockdown.It’s not hard to understand the scientists who created the bomb. The race hate and war-lust of nazism needed stopping. Among the voices is that of Albert Einstein, writing to President Roosevelt in 1939 to state that a nuclear chain reaction might unleash “vast amounts of power” – another way of saying Emc2.Germany had physicists, too, even after driving many great Jewish academics such as Einstein abroad, and it had the world’s first ballistic missile, the V2 rocket. So it would have been naive not to have developed what physics declared possible. The trouble is, the atomic bomb was used on Japan, not Germany. Was that because even in the most extreme of European conflicts it was easier for the western allies to contemplate dropping it on Asians?That is certainly what this artwork suggests. There are disturbing quotations from President Harry S Truman, who made the ultimate decision to use the new secret weapon against Hiroshima and then Nagasaki, about his hatred for “Chinese and Japs”. He’s also quoted as saying in August 1945, just after the raids, that Japan was a “beast” and had to be dealt with “as a beast”.A defender of the decision might argue that the “beast” was the fascistic nationalism of the Japanese army, which had proved in suicidal battles for tiny islands and kamikaze attacks that it would never surrender without some awe-inspiring final defeat. Even after Nagasaki, some officers attempted to prevent Emperor Hirohito’s surrender.But this quietly devastating work of art leaves you as uneasy and unquiet as we ought to be. The artists rightly compare the threat of nuclear war with the reality of human-caused climate change as the dire consequences of our species’ phenomenal power and hubris. Light fills the screen, spectral, godlike, unfathomable. The world ended 75 years ago and somehow we go on living."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30c4c767c52e42c45b78b8a01981b7ffe8f7d5d2/0_191_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79c8c3a96256ee04bbf88129cfab6446","title":"mersey paradise a tour through retro liverpool in pictures","story":"Tom Wood spent decades photographing the pubs, clubs and bus rides of Liverpool – and the people who inhabited them.

She reflects on its profound appealAs a kid at Jones Beach, New York, I spent a lot of time in the four feet of water at the scalloped, lacy edge of the Atlantic. I can picture the scene clearly: my brother and cousins and I bob up and down in the shallows, waiting for a wave to come and lift us off our feet. We use our arms as rudders to pilot us along the face of a wave as it breaks, depositing us at the foamy intersection where water meets sand. Get up, laugh, repeat.We are mesmerised by that heaving body of water. So is everybody else. On a hot day, and on a holiday, 100,000 other people might be at Jones Beach. Lifeguards sit sentinel at their elevated stations, policing the crowds from behind their mirrored sunglasses. There’s something primal about a day like that at the beach, like all the animals heading to the watering hole. Water is a magnet for our teeming throng of humanity.Such was my introduction to wild swimming, as a child growing up in New York. Over almost four decades of swimming, I have observed the changing scenery behind that practice – from beach to pool to open ocean and back again – and its evolving role in my life. I wrote a book about it, a cultural and scientific exploration of humanity’s relationship with water.What I couldn’t have imagined, of course, was that this book about swimming would be published in a time when most people couldn’t swim.What do you do in a pandemic summer, when you are frozen in place, on indefinite pause from moving like a skipping stone across the globe? What do you do when the domesticated, chlorinated bodies of water you are accustomed to are suddenly closed?Maybe, increasingly desperate under the intense eye of an August sun, you begin to look to the oceans, rivers, lakes and streams nearby – to see them anew. You notice mood, shifting temperature, texture, the days when surface chop precludes getting in. Your own mood reflects that. You can’t get what you want as quickly or as easily as you like. And so you adapt.In Waterlog, his celebrated chronicle of swimming through Britain’s waterways, the naturalist Roger Deakin described swimming as having a transformative, Alice-in-Wonderland quality it was an activity that had power over his perception of self and of time. “When you enter the water, something like metamorphosis happens,” he wrote. “Leaving behind the land, you go through the looking-glass surface and enter a new world … You see and experience when you’re swimming in a way that is completely different from any other.” Your sense of the present, he added, “is overwhelming”.I live in California now. Over the last few months of dedicated wild swimming in the Pacific and in the San Francisco Bay, I have noted both the otherworldliness and the acuteness of experience that Deakin so vividly depicted. The periodic shift in perspective – from land to water level, external to internal, anthropocentric to aquacentric – has helped me get to the other side of many a difficult day.In pre-pandemic times, I swam several mornings a week in the pool, and surfed the rest as conditions allowed. Most of the time, it didn’t matter if it was rainy or cold or blustery I could get into a temperature-controlled outdoor pool year-round and be quite happy. Now my engagement with the water is completely dictated by nature. If there are howling winds, water quality issues, or storm-related runoff, I can’t get in. It’s an exercise in relinquishing control.In this time of isolation, I have found community in the lovely stream of letters from readers, who describe their new embrace of wild swimming, and the process of their own seeking. In my book, Why We Swim, I write that to live deliberately as a swimmer means that you are a seeker: a chaser of the ocean’s blue corduroy, a follower of river veins. It involves a certain kind of bravery to embrace the uncertainty.In those childhood days at Jones Beach, I watched the ways people dipped in and out. Some were just there to cool off: electrifying entry, quick exit. Some stayed awhile, floating and splashing and swimming. Always there were people who kept their distance and didn’t go in at all. But still they came, hypnotised by the pulse of the ocean, alive to the sound of the surf and the smell of the briny air. I liked how the ocean seemed to draw breath, lying placid one moment and rearing up the next, moving us in one rippling mass to and from the horizon.Once, a big wave came and smacked me from behind. Surprise overturning, ass over teakettle. Then a liquid, green room, clouded by sand. Me, swimming and swimming toward nothing. Which way is up? Four feet isn’t very much water, but it’s deep enough to drown in.Time stretched I wondered about the press of my burning lungs, wishing for air. Then time restarted, with an accidental kick to the head from my cousin swimming not two feet away. Gifted this reference point, I scrambled to the surface, my hair wrapped around my face like kelp. Embarrassed and gasping, I looked around. When I realised that no one had noticed I was in trouble, I pretended that I never was. And I turned right back into the sea.What did I find so alluring about the water that I could forgive a murder attempt, and so quickly at that? I was just a young swimmer, going back for more of the magic: the illusion of being native in an environment that is no home to humans.This summer, as I prepare for a flight back to the east coast, an essential trip to be with loved ones in a terribly fraught time, I am gripped by anxiety. So much is unknown. And yet I think about swimming, and wild swimming especially, as a lifelong education in facing down fear.I think back to a year ago, when, in a fluke of airplane routeing, I flew home over Jones Beach. We circled the tower, so low over the barrier beaches that I could see the inidual pinpoints of people amassed on their shores. It was a view of my aquatic childhood that I had never seen before, and as I looked and looked, drinking in the pictures below, I was surprised by the tears that suddenly pricked my eyes.We are pulled to the paradox of water as a source of life and death, and we have figured out myriad ways to conduct ourselves in it. Not everybody is a swimmer, but everyone has a swimming story to tell. In the examination of this universal experience – and it is universal, whether you are fearful of the water or not whether you love it or leave it, you will encounter it at some point in your life – we find ourselves flexing our survival muscles, quietly triumphant at our own persistence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a087109f35d1ac5f504f7b9c0a1f6f9bf4c5d84/0_199_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=174c3e24bfd15456220921155ae39b76","title":"what would negative interest rate mean uk consumers","story":"Bank of England is considering pros and cons of drastic move as Covid-19 weighs on economyIf it’s a fixed-rate mortgage, a cut in interest rates would mean no change. Most households are on this type of deal – in recent years about nine in 10 new mortgages have been taken on a fixed rate.If it is a variable-rate mortgage – a tracker, or a mortgage on or linked to a lender’s standard variable rate – the rate could fall a little if the base rate is cut. But the drop is likely to be limited by terms and conditions. Skipton building society, for example, has a tracker at 1.29 percentage points above the base rate that can only go up.You will need to dig out your paperwork to see how low your mortgage rate could go.The cheapest tracker mortgages from earlier in the year have been pulled and repriced with larger margins, to cushion lenders against falling rates. If rates are cut again, expect more of that, as well as the collars already seen on some deals.A negative base rate means banks and building societies have to pay to keep money on deposit, and it is designed to discourage them from doing so and make them keen to lend.Credit card rates are usually low for new customers, but rise far above the base rate once introductory periods have ended, so will not be anywhere close to falling into negative territory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebae897b108786aea3ed6749af1091b60492c03b/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb73435e8a92028179a95da8226391dc","title":"hybrid bmw can now auto swap to battery power in london and birmingham","story":"German carmaker puts pressure on UK government over proposed ban on hybridsMore than 10,000 BMW plug-in hybrid cars on British roads will be able to automatically swap to battery power when entering low emissions zones in London or Birmingham city centres from Friday.Newer BMW cars will be able to switch automatically from burning fossil fuels in internal combustion engines to using battery power with zero exhaust emissions as soon as the car’s GPS navigation system detects that it has reached an emissions zone.London and Birmingham are the first UK cities to have the “geofencing” feature activated, following in the footsteps of multiple German cities, as BMW tries to highlight fuel cost savings and the potential for lower emissions from plug-in hybrids.However, the UK government has already announced that it is considering a total ban on internal combustion engine cars, including all hybrids, from 2035 or even earlier. The government withdrew direct subsidies for plug-in hybrid sales in 2019, provoking a furious response from the car industry.Pieter Nota, the BMW board member responsible for sales, told the : “Plainly it would be wrong to not support plug-in hybrids. It’s an important step in the electrification of the fleet.”Nota also warned that a ban on hybrids could hit UK manufacturing jobs, pointing out that about a quarter of the engines produced at BMW’s plant at Hams Hall, Warwickshire, are destined for hybrids.Plug-in hybrid cars can emit less pollution than traditional vehicles, and have the ability to travel on electric power alone for journeys of as much as 50 miles – covering the vast majority of weekday commutes travelled by car.However, some environmental campaigners are highly critical of the hybrid compromise when battery alternatives exist. For instance, the US carmaker Tesla – emerging as a major competitor to premium carmakers like BMW – claims a range of 348 miles (560km) for its battery-powered Model 3, enough to drive from London to Scotland on a single charge.BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar Land Rover and other carmakers are aiming to rapidly scale up their production of pure battery electric vehicles as well as plug-in hybrids as they try to meet emissions reduction limits.The technology that will automatically switch cars to battery power will be included in every new plug-in hybrid BMW 3, 5 and 7 Series saloon and the X5 SUV, and is in 10,000 compatible cars on UK roads that can receive software updates over mobile networks.In London the feature will cover the congestion charge and ultra-low-emissions zones, while in Birmingham it will cover the clean air zone due to be brought in in 2021. The software could be extended to other UK cities such as Glasgow or Bristol as they consider ways to reduce harmful car emissions, including nitrogen oxides as well as carbon dioxide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee97da5e17bb7b243c49b2180f9ec7885a38b6f5/438_217_3062_1837/master/3062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d5e1faf1fafae9628568fe22f3615d8","title":"the guardian view on judicial review hands off the rule of law","story":"The government is still angry with the courts for ruling against prorogation last year. Anger is no basis for threatening to limit a system that works wellNot much has been heard of this commission since then. In large part that is doubtless because the Covid-19 pandemic has meant the government has enough other things on its plate. There has, however, been speculation that the commission has been quietly shelved, to be replaced by a series of ad hoc mini-commissions. If that is true, then the first of these may be the one announced by the lord chancellor, Robert Buckland, at the end of July into the process of judicial review.It is too soon to judge whether the judicial review panel – or any other putative mini-commissions – is more than a figleaf to cover the possible demise of the larger project. But it would be a serious mistake to relax. The issues covered on page 48 of the manifesto are too important for that. As long as Dominic Cummings and Munira Mirza rule the policymaking agenda in Boris Johnson’s government, the appetite for assaults on Britain’s liberal values and institutions is unlikely to decline.As expounded by Lord Bingham in The Rule of Law, judicial review means that ministers and officials must exercise their powers “in good faith, fairly, for the purpose for which the powers were conferred, without exceeding the limits of such powers and not unreasonably”. Parliament confers hundreds of such powers on ministers and officials in every area of law. It is therefore an essential pillar of the rule of law and of the necessary control of government.This country has no written constitution. Its law has evolved organically over centuries. Judicial review has always been integral to this process. It is not a new invention. It also works. When a complaint is upheld, the courts normally require an official to go back and take a lawful decision, or to refrain from doing something that would be unlawful. Without judicial review, governments can proceed unlawfully – and they will.This is absolutely not politics by other means. That accusation was made in the Tory manifesto and repeated by Mr Buckland when he launched the judicial review panel. It is a childish calumny. The accusation reflects the government’s anger when the supreme court ruled that last summer’s prorogation of parliament was unlawful. Anger is no basis on which to do any of the things that the panel have been asked to look at – things like limiting the areas of law in which applications for judicial review can be considered.Nor is it a good basis for doing something with such potentially large consequences as quickly as the government is doing. The panel is supposed to report before Christmas. That suggests that consultation will be minimal. Restriction of judicial review would be an explosive move. The panel and the government should decide to go no further down this path. Right now, ministers have far more urgent things to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f78b30423077b766d4b3ce046d90bcd7b9425e8e/0_102_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1dba4b88d0350b8dfb3258f2e327f27","title":"the guardian view on planning put people before profit","story":"New green homes are needed, but the prime minister’s promise to cut red tape is a soundbite not a solution How much do people care about the planning system? England is about to find out. Initial reaction to the government’s plan to strip councils of their powers over development has been ferocious, with planners, architects, local government, conservation charities and housing campaigners lining up with Labour to attack it. But whether ministers can be deterred from legislation that would replace the current case-by-case decision-making process with a presumption in favour of building in designated “growth” and “renewal” zones, will depend on whether the outcry runs deeper – and how long it lasts.Eager to please these voters, among whom Conservatives know they have a problem, and to boost at least one part of the economy and jobs market, ministers and their advisers set about smoothing a path for developers across the tricky terrain of local authority planning meetings. But while Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, promised a “really serious debate” in communities about the new local planning documents, and insisted that the shakeup would “really help small builders”, the far more likely effect of the proposals, should they become law, is that local democracy will once again be the loser while property speculators, who form a powerful group of Tory donors, are the winners. While the promised “fast track for beauty” might sound attractive – for who, given the choice, does not prefer high-quality design? – in the context of a white paper that seeks to remove local scrutiny, and give developers free rein, it should be seen for what it is: a spoonful of sugar to help traditionalists swallow the rest.It is only a few weeks since Mr Jenrick was revealed to have dined and swapped texts with the former  owner Richard Desmond in advance of granting him permission for a £1bn property scheme 24 hours before new community charges were imposed – a decision that was later quashed by the courts. Meanwhile at the Grenfell inquiry, evidence of the way that cost-cutting and safety checks were handled under a flagship Tory council continues to shock. Thousands of people across the country remain stuck in towers covered in unsafe cladding, while there is still no sign of a promised bill to strengthen tenants’ rights, a measure that is more urgent than ever given the approaching end of a freeze on evictions and predictions of an upsurge in pandemic-linked homelessness.If the government and its MPs truly believe that a complete overhaul of a planning system created in 1947 is in the best interests of the country, and a priority in the current crisis, they must make the case for it. Environmental standards, it goes without saying, should be uppermost. Tweets from the prime minister, promising to “cut the red tape”, are not only insufficient but insulting given the recent and agonising history of buildings regulation failure. Whether green and pleasant or grey and urban, our land and the people who live on it deserve more than soundbites from the politicians who want to restrict their say over its future shape."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f8981eafcf9c2c2473a8049b1dfd547a1534c38/0_2_5400_3242/master/5400.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=69459d038dbca54c8f04ead3840a64cb","title":"levelling up school funding policy favours wealthy pupils study","story":"Children on free school meals stand to lose out, potentially widening attainment gapChildren on free school meals and minority ethnic pupils in England will lose out under the government’s latest school funding plans, research suggests.At a time of growing concern about the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on the most disadvantaged children, analysis of government education spending plans shows extra funding will be “skewed” in favour of pupils from wealthy backgrounds.After years of budget cuts, the government promised schools an additional £7.1bn by 2022-23, but according to research by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) disadvantaged pupils will receive funding increases at around two-thirds the rate of their better-off peers over the next four years.Last month the government unveiled its school funding settlement for 2021-22, including details of how funds are to be allocated to schools across England through the national funding formula. Linking those allocations with pupil characteristics data from the school census, the EPI has been able to calculate the average funding per pupil by those characteristics.The EPI report acknowledges that pupils from low-income backgrounds will continue to attract more funding overall than children from wealthier families, but warns that the government’s “levelling up” agenda, which guarantees minimum levels of funding for all schools, will mean more money going to schools that have historically been funded at a lower rate but which have fewer pupils from poorer backgrounds.Jon Andrews, the author of the report and deputy head of research at the EPI, said: “Our analysis shows that the longstanding link between school funding and pupil need is being eroded by the policy of ‘levelling up’.“By directing a proportion of additional funding towards schools with historically lower levels of funding, the government is ensuring that pupils from more affluent backgrounds see greater increases than those from poorer backgrounds.”Earlier EPI research has shown that disadvantaged pupils are typically 18 months behind their more affluent classmates by the end of GCSEs. The sector fears the attainment gap could grow substantially post-Covid, with poorer pupils having accessed less education.“Even before the extraordinary circumstances that schools have faced in 2020 there was emerging evidence that the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers was at risk of widening,” the EPI report concludes.“The crisis is likely to have increased that risk and the challenge of narrowing the gap just got harder. The government’s approach to funding does not appear to be taking that challenge seriously.”EPI’s executive chairman, David Laws, said: “Those from disadvantaged backgrounds will need maximum support to ensure their life chances are not damaged by this period of disruption. But by skewing extra funding towards more affluent pupils, the government’s approach of ‘levelling up’ school funding is fundamentally at odds with this goal.”The Liberal Democrats’ education spokesperson, Layla Moran, said: “Every child, no matter their background, deserves the very best start in life, but this government’s funding policy fails to take account of the additional support some pupils need to help them thrive during their time in school.”Avis Gilmore, the deputy general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The cuts schools and colleges have suffered to their budgets since 2015 have impacted greatly on children and young people’s education. While we welcome the extra money being given to schools and colleges it is still not enough to address the current shortfall in funding.”A Department for Education spokesperson said the national funding formula would continue to target schools with the greatest numbers of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.“Schools which have been historically underfunded will also receive the greatest increase as every child deserves a superb education – regardless of which school they attend, or where they happen to grow up – with our £1bn Covid catch-up package on top of this, levelling up opportunities for every young person up and down the country,” they said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b2c1b0dd4b81368bb2f9ee364b98de5dcecf2c/0_115_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39f1251905573357aa93465bdfb253cd","title":"chinese fleet fishing galapagos islands environment","story":"Jonathan Green had been tracking a whale shark named Hope across the eastern Pacific for 280 days when the satellite transmissions from a GPS tag on her dorsal fin abruptly stopped.It was not unusual for the GPS signal to go silent, even for weeks at a time, said Green, a scientist who has been studying the world’s largest fish for three decades in the unique marine ecosystem around the Galápagos Islands.But then he looked at satellite images in the area where Hope was last tracked – more than a thousand nautical miles west of the islands – and noticed the ocean was being patrolled by hundreds of Chinese fishing boats.“I began to look into it and found that at the very end of her track she began to speed up,” said Green, co-founder and director of the Galápagos Whale Shark Project.“It went from one knot to six or seven knots for the last 32 minutes – which is, of course, the speed of a fishing boat,” he said.The fishing vessels that Green saw on the satellite images are believed to belong to an enormous Chinese-flagged fleet which Ecuadorian authorities last week warned was just outside the Galápagos Islands’ territorial waters.“I don’t have proof but my hypothesis is that she was caught by vessels from the same fleet which is now situated to the south of the islands,” Green told the . She is the third GPS-tracked whale shark to have gone missing in the last decade, he added.The Chinese fleet, numbering more than 200 vessels, is in international waters just outside a maritime border around the Galápagos Islands and also Ecuador’s coastal waters, said Norman Wray, the islands’ governor.Chinese fishing vessels come every year to the seas around the Galápagos, which were declared a Unesco world heritage site in 1978, but this year’s fleet is one of the largest seen in recent years. Of the 248 vessels, 243 are flagged to China including to companies with suspected records of illegal, unreported and unregulated, or IUU, fishing, according to research by C4ADS, a data analysis NGO.The fleet includes fishing boats and refrigerated container – or reefer – ships to store enormous catches.Transferring cargo between vessels is prohibited under international maritime law yet the Chinese flotilla has supply and storage ships along with longline and squid fishing boats.“There are some fleets which don’t seem to abide by any regulations,” said Wray.One captain of an Ecuadorian tuna boat saw the Chinese fishing boats up close in early July, before the end of the tuna season.“They just pull up everything!” said the captain, who asked not to be named. “We are obliged to take a biologist aboard who checks our haul if we catch a shark we have to put it back, but who controls them?”He recalled navigating through the fleet at night, constantly changing course to avoid boats, as their lights illuminated the sea to attract squid to the surface.“It was like looking at a city at night,” he said.The longline fishing boats had up to 500 lines, each with thousands of fishhooks, he estimated, and claimed that some of the vessels would turn off their automatic tracking systems to avoid detection, particularly when operating in protected areas.Chinese fishing practices first caught the attention of Ecuador in 2017 when its navy seized the Chinese reefer Fu Yuan Yu Leng 999 within the Galápagos marine reserve. Inside its containers were 6,000 frozen sharks – including the endangered hammerhead shark and whale shark.“It was a slaughterhouse,” said Green, describing the images of the cargo hold. “This kind of slaughter is going on on a massive scale in international waters and nobody is witnessing it.”The seizure prompted protests outside the Chinese embassy in Quito Ecuador fined the vessel $6m and the 20 Chinese crew-members were later jailed for up to four years for illegal fishing.The arrival of the latest fleet has also stirred public outrage and a formal complaint by Ecuador as its navy is on alert for any incursion into Ecuadorian waters.The Chinese embassy in Quito said that China was a “responsible fishing nation” with a “zero-tolerance” attitude towards illegal fishing. It had confirmed with Ecuador’s navy that all the Chinese fishing vessels were operating legally “and don’t represent a threat to anyone”, it said in a statement last month. On Thursday China announced a three-month fishing ban in the high seas west of the marine reserve, but it will not come into force until September.Roque Sevilla, a former mayor of Quito, who is leading a team in charge of designing a “protection strategy” for the islands, said the fleet practices “indiscriminate fishing – regardless of species or age – which is causing a serious deterioration of the quality of fauna that we will have in our seas”.Ecuador would establish a corridor of marine reserves with Pacific-facing neighbours Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia to seal off important areas of marine ersity, Sevilla told the .Protecting the Cocos Ridge, an underwater mountain range which connects the Galápagos Islands to mainland Costa Rica, and the Carnegie Ridge which links the archipelago to Ecuador and continental South America, could close off more than 200,000 sq nautical miles of ocean otherwise vulnerable to industrial fishing, he said.He added Ecuador had called for a diplomatic meeting with Chile, Peru, Colombia and Panama to present a formal protest against China.“When the Galápagos’s protected area was first created it was cutting edge,” said Matt Rand, director of the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy, “but compared to other newer marine protected areas Galápagos is now potentially lacking in size to protect the bioersity.”Milton Castillo, the Galápagos Islands’ representative for Ecuador’s human rights ombudsman’s office, said he had asked the prosecutor’s office to inspect the cargo holds of the Chinese ships based on the legal principle of the universal and extraterritorial protection of endangered species.China’s distant-water fishing fleet is the biggest in the world, with nearly 17,000 vessels – 1,000 of which use “flags of convenience” and are registered in other countries, according to research by the Overseas Development Institute.The fleet often fishes in the territorial waters of low-income countries, the report said, having depleted fish stocks in domestic waters.Green said the “explosion of life” created by the confluence of cold and warm ocean currents around the Galápagos Islands is exactly why the Chinese armada is hovering around the archipelago’s waters.“The Galápagos marine reserve is a place of very great productivity, high biomass but also bioersity,” he said. The longline fishing technique used by the fleet catch big fish like tuna, but also sharks, rays, turtles and marine mammals like sea lions and dolphins, he added.“This is not fishing any more, it is simply destroying the resources of our oceans,” Green said. “We should ask whether any nation on this planet has the right to destroy what is common ground.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3f9399173cd7dfa2c83248ee4dbd9ef35973269/0_279_5924_3555/master/5924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab03367f9573ce7ad7ba83378268de66","title":"co2 extreme droughts in central europe likely to increase seven fold","story":"Researchers say moderate reductions in CO2 emissions could halve their likelihoodExtreme droughts are likely to become much more frequent across central Europe, and if global greenhouse gas emissions rise strongly they could happen seven times more often, new research has shown.The area of crops likely to be affected by drought is also set to increase, and under sharply rising CO2 levels would nearly double in central Europe in the second half of this century, to more than 40m hectares (154,440 sq miles) of farmland.Central Europe suffered its biggest and most damaging drought on record in 2018 and 2019, which had two of the three warmest summer periods ever recorded on the continent. The summers were also much drier than average, and more than half of the region suffered severe drought conditions.Rivers and watercourses dried up, some crops were ruined and wildfires increased during these two years of extreme drought. The only other drought on record to come close, in 1949 and 1950, affected a land area about a third smaller.Rohini Kumar, one of the authors of the study, told the  the findings were concerning. “The findings indicate that introducing measures to reduce future carbon emissions may lower the risk of more frequent consecutive drought events across Europe. On the one hand, we need to step up our efforts to reduce greenhouse gases worldwide, and at the same time deal with strategies to adapt to climate change.”Strong reductions in greenhouse gases would reduce the frequency of such extreme droughts to “a very negligible number”, said Kumar.The paper is published on Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.The study adds to an increasing body of research showing the impacts of global heating on Europe. Previous studies have suggested that southern and central Europe will experience more drought, with one study projecting that European cities will become much hotter, with London forecast to have a climate more like Barcelona by 2050 and southern and central European cities seeing more extreme levels of heat.Constantin Zohner, of the Crowther Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, who was not involved in the research, said the study showed the consequences of failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

Raúl Jiménez converted a penalty to give Nuno Espírito Santo’s side an early lead but Olympiakos made them suffer before the final whistle triggered joy and relief at Molineux. Wolves will face Sevilla in the last eight in Germany on Tuesday.At full-time Nuno gathered his players in a huddle in the centre-circle. “I told the boys: ‘OK, holidays must wait,’” revealed the manager.At its simplest, the story of this nerve-splaying duel boiled down to a contrast between two goalkeepers: Rui Patricio performed heroics for Wolves to preserve the lead given to them by Jiménez after a blunder by Bobby Allain, who was making his European debut for Olympiakos because of injury to their first-choice goalkeeper, José Sa. Nuno gripped Patricio in a mighty bear hug at full-time, while Allain kneeled on the grass at the other end, alone in his thoughts.But a wider tale unfolded here: this was a laudable triumph for a team who mined hitherto untapped reserves of fortitude to emerge victorious from their 58th match of an epic season. Although no one at Molineux likes to complain about a heavy workload as their club enjoy their first European adventure for 39 years, the extent to which it is straining their bodies was plain to see. Jonny Otto departed after 17 minutes with a knee injury and Wolves’ other wing-back, Matt Doherty, looked close to fainting after another outstanding display. “He was not very well, he ran a lot,” said Nuno who has to find a way of revitalising his players for what could prove an even bigger ordeal in five days. No one said glory comes easy.Olympiakos did their utmost to push Wolves to extra-time. Patricio foiled them with two top-class saves. Yet early on there was no sign of the torment that Wolves would endure, as they started as if determined to secure progress as early as possible. Not a bad strategy considering that Allain was bound to be on edge on his first outing in continental competition. The keeper survived a scare in the second minute when Jiménez fired wide from the edge of the area. But there was no reprieve in the ninth minute.The goalkeeper miscontrolled a backpass and then, over-eager to atone, shoved Daniel Podence to the ground. Jiménez showed no clemency, sending Allain the wrong way from the spot as he stroked the ball into the net.Wolves’ dominance soon subsided as the visitors began to show the quality that had enabled them to come from behind to eliminate Arsenal earlier in the tournament. Shortly after Wolves lost Jonny to injury, Giorgos Masouras triggered the first alarm in the home area, heading wide from 10 yards. Moments later Masouras combined niftily with Kostas Tsimikas down the left, forcing Patricio to make a fine ing save to push Tsimikas’ shot round a post. Then came an even closer shave, as Mady Camara scored what he believed to be a valid goal, only for it to be nullified after a VAR review found Youssef El Arabi’s armpit to have been offside in the buildup.But Olympiakos were emboldened nonetheless, and Wolves grew more dishevelled, misplacing passes and struggling to keep up with their opponents’ movement, most of which was choreographed by Mathieu Valbuena, still delightfully inventive at 35.Wolves were grateful when half-time came. Olympiakos put the pressure straight back on when the match resumed, with their midfield supremacy chafing home nerves.At least tWolves could exhale in the 55th minute thanks to an uncharacteristic miss by El Arabi, who botched a header after a fine cross by Omar Elabdellaoui. Wolves threatened rarely but Podence tested Allain, his drive from 20 yards bringing a smart save. Soon Wolves were on the defensive again, Kostas Fortounis weaving his way into the box before El Arabi shot wide. The tension weighed hard.With 20 minutes left Nuno made the switch that had long looked necessary, introducing Leander Dendoncker to bolster midfield. Allain kept Wolves on edge by denying Jota. Then Patricio thwarted the visitors by producing the save of the match, ing full length to claw away a header by Ahmed Hassan.“This means a lot,” Nuno added. “We started against Crusaders more than a year ago. That’s a long, long time. Now we have a fantastic victory that allows us to be in the last eight. That is huge, everybody needs to be reminded of that. It’s crazy but today we made it worth it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74e4530cbfd1cd4cd836b10aae519b9d74e33784/74_123_3394_2037/master/3394.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=641ed1eeb02689bd687f7e4af6584126","title":"unwind in malta your long weekend itinerary for a dose of r and r","story":"With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, it’s always the right time to kick back and relax in this culture-rich countryWritten about by Homer as the archipelago where the nymph Calypso so beguiled Ulysses that he stayed for seven years, the Maltese islands remain idyllically beautiful. They offer visitors spectacular beaches, cobalt sea, prehistoric sites dating back more than 5,000 years, and soul-soothingly beautiful natural landscapes. With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta is ideal for some restorative R\u0026ampR, and you can get here with minimal stress, no jet lag, and only a short-haul flight from the UK.Day one: soak up VallettaStart to unwind in Valletta, Malta’s elegant coastal capital, where five-star and boutique hotels offer spa treatments, massages and hot tubs and pools overlooking beautiful views. You could spend your first day exploring some of the attractions of this Unesco world heritage site, one of the world’s most beautiful and unspoilt cities. Its pedestrianised centre is full of pavement cafes to relax and enjoy a drink in the warm sunshine. You can dine in the evening at outdoor, sea-facing restaurants, eating fresh seafood and other delicious local cuisine, and enjoy the warm Mediterranean sun.Day two: more spas, speedboats and the ‘silent city’Valletta is renowned for its spectacular boutique hotels, such as the glorious Palazzo Consiglia with an underground spa and rooftop pool. One suite in SU29 has a rooftop Jacuzzi-with-a-view, as do the suites in the historic townhouse of Casa Ellul. Locanda La Gelsomina, over the harbour in the even-more-relaxing small town of Birgu, offers in-house massages, private yoga and a Japanese Zen sound bath.Once you’ve spent a day smoothing out any knots, it’s an easy trip by bus or car to take it easy on the beautiful beaches of Golden Bay or Għajn Tuffieħa for a day of beach relaxation. This astoundingly scenic chain of soft-sanded beaches is lapped by the warm Mediterranean Sea, and offers every kind of watersports: indulge in some stand-up paddleboarding, waterskiing or take a speedboat along the coast to see the otherworldly rock formations and caves that glint with reflected blue light. The beachfront Radisson Blu Resort \u0026amp Spa has superb spa facilities, or you could base yourself in a seaside town such as Mellieħa, close to another white-sanded beach, with lots of hotel choices.A cobweb-clearing walk along Malta’s Dingli cliffs offers sweeping panoramas for miles across the ocean, and you could finish the day with a meal in the tranquil “silent city” of Mdina. This hilltop, walled, golden-stone old capital, with its atmospheric and historic narrow lanes, is best experienced after all the daytime visitors have ebbed away.Days three and four: go Zen in GozoOn your third and fourth days, slow down your pace even more by heading to the neighbouring smaller island of Gozo, only a short trip by ferry. Hidden coves are reached via flights of vertiginous steps, with pale copper sands lapped by azure waters. Artist and poet Edward Lear visited in the 19th century and was so taken with this curious, dramatic landscape that he invented words to describe it: calling it “pomskizillious” and “gromophiberous”.Gozo’s country roads are ideal for cycling or walks, with sea views and seemingly hugely outsized churches in the middle of the countryside. The island’s famous for the warmth and hospitality of its locals, and is the kind of place where no one bothers locking their front door. Gozo is famous for its large, rentable “farmhouses” with gardens and pools, as well as some spectacular hotels, such as chic haven ThirtySeven and the five-star hideaway Kempinski Hotel San Lawrenz. You can also dine on spectacular fresh Mediterranean produce here. Gozo has many renowned restaurants, serving zero-mileage local cuisine cooked by some of the best chefs on the archipelago, with ingredients such as the local fresh cheese, locally grown tomatoes and olives, fresh fish, and local wines.Gozo’s five-star spas offer a wide range of treatments and therapies from across the world as well as saunas, Jacuzzis, steam rooms and indoor swimming pools.A longer restIf two days isn’t long enough, extend your Gozo trip with yoga and pilates retreats, which are ideal for longer wellness stays. The week-long Paola’s BodyBarre retreat, for example, gives you the chance to take part in daily pilates, barre, fitness and yoga fusion sessions, as well as excursions to copper-sanded Ramla Bay, the cerulean Blue Lagoon, Gozo’s coastal salt pans, and the vast Ġgantija temples, which predate Stonehenge. The next retreat will take place in 2021, for more information email: office.uk@visitmalta.It’s remarkable how many relaxation and wellness activities you can fit in over a four-day weekend trip to Malta, recharging in beautiful settings or keeping active outdoors (although longer trips to Malta and Gozo are to be encouraged – there’s a lot that cannot be covered in a four-day trip). Book your wellness trip to Malta today to restore a sense of balance, for a holiday whose effects will last long after your return.In the wake of Covid-19 things are changing fast, so do check the latest advice from the Foreign Office before making any travel decisions and contact any hotels, restaurants or attractions mentioned in this article for the latest information on availability and opening times.

Over the past decade, the country has become a world leader on LGBTQ+ rights, from same-sex marriage and equal adoption, to liberal gender recognition laws for trans people. In fact, Malta was the first European country to protect people from discrimination based on gender identity or expression, and allows those who identify as neither man nor woman to use an “x” marker on official documents.The result? A place where LGBTQ+ people can live openly, and tourists can travel as their authentic selves. “I saw same-sex couples in straight bars feeling comfortable enough to kiss and honestly that always makes me happy,” Akbar recalls.Raucousness is just one part of Malta’s multifaceted LGBTQ+ offering, however, and Akbar notes that it’s also an ideal destination for a chilled holiday. “I think Malta has its own vibe, and I’d recommend it to LGBTQ+ travellers for a laid-back but queer-friendly holiday that’s inclusive.”The mix of vibrant nightlife and calm relaxation is something that 26-year-old drag performer and comedian Chucky Bartolo appreciates about Malta, too. Having been born and raised there, Bartolo recently moved to Glasgow, but returns to Malta to perform regularly. “There’s one party a month that I love called Lollipop,” which he says has grown into a huge bash over the years. “It’s thousands of people, every time.” And when LGBTQ+ travellers aren’t painting the town red, “people can lay around in Speedos, they can hold hands, kiss by the pool and no one cares. That’s great.”Bartolo recommends LGBTQ+ travellers visit the (somewhat ironically named) Strait Street, a historically flamboyant locale in the capital city of Valletta that used to be popular with sailors when Malta was under British rule. “It’s a great place, there are really cute bars and if you’re a gay couple kissing in the street, no one is going to bat an eye.”Malta’s queer nightlife doesn’t just provide a safe space for travellers and revellers, though. For Maxine Sophia Attard, a transgender performer who goes by the moniker MadameMaxxx, the queer scene also allows LGBTQ+ performers and artists to express themselves. Michelangelo, a club just outside of trendy Sliema, is one such venue Attard says their promotion and embracing of ersity has been part of what she describes as a “big improvement” in terms of people’s attitudes to the trans community in Malta.While there are a number of LGBTQ+ specific venues to enjoy, Bartolo notes that “most LGBTQ+ people just go to regular clubs”, as, widely speaking, everyone has always been accommodating. “When I go out, I’ll just go out to a regular club with gay people and my female friends. Malta’s nightlife is amazing and crazy,” he says.Inclusivity isn’t something that just happens, as 31-year-old Lilla Salamon can tell you. She’s one of many straight allies who have supported the island’s LGBTQ+ community, and her Gay Guide to Malta provides “up-to-date information on what to expect in Malta during their stay”, she says. “I had been working in marketing for 10 years, and after the Civil Union Act update in 2014 I noticed that businesses were trying to open their minds and doors to LGBTQ+ clients. They just had no idea how to do it, apart from sponsoring Pride week. With Gay Guide Malta I gave them a platform to talk to the LGBTQ+ community, both local and foreign, directly.”It would be remiss to talk about LGBTQ+ travel without mentioning Malta Pride, sadly cancelled this year, which has grown exponentially in the past five years, becoming a “massive, international-style Pride”, according to Bartolo. For 10 hours, the city of Valletta is closed down as everyone comes out to celebrate. There’s also a erse, week-long programme of talks and events, including LGBTQ+ inclusive football games.For Pride week, Salamon says that through Gay Guide Malta she encourages all the hotels she works with on the island to offer packages catering to LGBTQ+ travellers looking for a fun time. She also helps people who are planning same-sex weddings in the country, too. With affordable flights, it’s easy to get family members over for trips. It’s something she says has “upped the game for Malta”. “We have wedding packages,” she adds. “I only work with the best of the best. There are a lot of wedding planners in Malta and there are many who are fantastic. They also have experience with the legal side, too.”Malta is a welcoming place for LGBTQ+ travellers, but it’s also so much more. And that, Salamon believes, is ultimately what attracts people of all sexual and gender identities to the country. “Malta is a place with incredible heritage from a lot of different eras and cultures,” she explains. “And based on my experience, LGBTQ+ travellers are just looking for the same things as other travellers, only with the extra peace of mind that they won’t be treated differently.”* Not his real nameIn the wake of Covid-19 things are changing fast, so do check the latest advice from the Foreign Office before making any travel decisions and contact any hotels, restaurants or attractions mentioned in this article for the latest information on availability and opening times.

Leading reporters from rival outlets, such as Matthew Price of the BBC, were hired across with the promise of building a new station from scratch, complete with its own network of foreign bureaux, only for the project to be “paused” in early April when the pandemic made a launch impossible.It was to be one of the first transatlantic joint ventures between NBC and Sky, which have both been owned by the US media business Comcast since Rupert Murdoch sold his British television business in 2018.After months of uncertainty, staff at NBC Sky World News were told on Wednesday that the launch would not go ahead, leaving around 60 employees looking for jobs. Some journalists had left jobs elsewhere during the pandemic to join the startup, while others are concerned about their legal status after moving to the UK on visas tied to their employment at the station. Others described substantial spending, with a large studio having been set up at Sky News’ campus in Osterley, west London.Although the pandemic and the economic downturn are likely to be blamed for the channel’s failure, employees at the station suggested that the departure in May of the long-term NBC News boss Andy Lack – who had long planned an international TV station to rival CNN – played a key role. He had been a driving force behind the channel’s creation at NBC’s 30 Rock headquarters in New York.Lack was the boss of NBC News for five years during a chaotic period in which the channel made an ill-fated bet on hiring the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly while also reviving its MSNBC rolling news channel. Lack also had to contend with a series of sexual harassment claims at the network, firing the NBC host Matt Lauer and dealing with strongly disputed claims by Ronan Farrow that NBC News stopped an investigation into Harvey Weinstein.NBC sources have confirmed that staff were told that NBC Sky World News would not be launching. Staff were told there would be around 20 jobs created to provide international support to the existing US-focused NBC News and MSNBC teams, although most are expecting to leave the business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee56b89c793e1c384e79f22f6575e4f9d8659d4/0_0_1186_712/master/1186.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=041141f2adf7897809e31f3c2a9096e6","title":"how the world is coping with coronavirus six months on","story":"From Portugal to Pakistan, the ’s international correspondent Michael Safi looks at the different ways countries have been affected by the virus and the impact that is having on the lives of people thereIt’s six months since Covid-19 was registered as an urgent threat, and although the panic at the scenarios that filled imaginations in those first weeks – of millions of imminent deaths, medical systems buckling and food supplies running scarce – has largely abated, the virus has not.

It is a period of grinding negotiation between a virus whose dynamics are still mysterious and the increasingly pressing need to earn incomes, educate children and connect with one another."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9a8deb3fcf592cd80fec1435c48bdc0e7ed2cb0/0_0_2555_1534/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32fe8f380d1792dd3c4f791c197d9b45","title":"hadley freeman on the future of the royals","story":" columnist Hadley Freeman discusses the fallout from the publication of Finding Freedom, a biography of Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and the latest allegations surrounding Prince Andrew columnist Hadley Freeman tells Rachel Humphreys why 2020 is not shaping up to be a great year for the royals. It began with the bombshell announcement that the Sussexes - Prince Harry and his wife Meghan - were stepping back as senior royals, and later saw them relocate to Los Angeles. Last month, extracts from a biography, Finding Freedom, chronicled what the authors claim has been a deepening rift between Prince Harry, Meghan and Buckingham Palace.  Hadley also discusses Prince Andrew. He ended 2019 by stepping back from public duties after his disastrous Newsnight interview where he discussed his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The arrest of Epstein’s close friend Ghislaine Maxwell in July has put Prince Andrew’s name back in the headlines. This month the FBI has said it has been passed information from a witness claiming to have seen the Duke of York at Tramp nightclub, the evening he claims he was at Pizza Express in Woking.

The clubs have endured a challenging five months financially and BT enters the final year of its contract with England’s top flight next season.“I personally believe that Covid-19 will cause a correction in the markets for television sports rights which will mean the value will not rise as it has done in the past,” said Green. “I think everyone will be more discerning about what they pay given that the country is facing a potential recession which could leave viewers with less money in their pockets.“We want to be able to offer customers value and while it is impossible to say exactly what will happen, there will be a different approach. At BT, we will look at every tender-right that comes along and value it accordingly. What the lockdown highlighted was the importance of live sport: when it returned with the Bundesliga, our audience over three channels was 750,000 compared to 100,000 before.”World Rugby is setting up a working group involving unions, clubs and players to look at the feasibility of a global season which would end overlaps between the international and clubs games. It would mean summer club rugby in Europe, a shift that BT would not oppose.“We would enthusiastically adopt whatever model any rights holder had across our schedule,” said Green. “We recognise rugby has calendar issues and it is an issue for the sport. There are times in the season currently when clubs have potentially weakened squads because of international commitments.“We would prefer the clubs to be at full strength as often as possible and if there were never a clash with international rugby on a weekend, it would be fantastic for us. If the clubs went to the summer and we were the broadcaster, we would embrace it. I have been involved in this business for 30 years and our relationship with Premiership Rugby is one of the best I have known.”Saracens will not be on BT next season as they will be in the Championship as punishment for flouting salary cap regulations, although they do not know when that season will start, with December the likely date because of coronavirus restrictions.“It is a golden opportunity for our England players to have a quieter club year, something akin to a sabbatical,” said the club’s director of rugby, Mark McCall, who this week spoke to the British \u0026amp Irish Lions head coach, Warren Gatland, about the 2021 tour. “We would ensure they had enough rugby to mean they were firing come the tour.”To ensure no future infringements, Saracens have set up a salary cap working group which will be chaired by the new board member Vic Luck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17120ec67f0ddb3d7aef430a06bbe976c15aa584/0_168_4363_2618/master/4363.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=de89e6cd2ba35f3e5beeb1b28bfed866","title":"london marathon becomes elite only race running laps st james park","story":"It is the news that thousands of runners, who have continued to toil and boil throughout lockdown, have long feared: this year’s London Marathon, which had been pushed back from April to October, will no longer be a mass-participation event after plans to use “revolutionary” Bluetooth technology to safely allow 45,000 competitors to social distance were abandoned following a jump in coronavirus cases in the UK.An elite-only, crowd-free race will be staged instead, as first revealed by the  in April, with athletes running 19.8 laps of a looped course in St James’s Park on 4 October before finishing on the Mall as normal.In a further blow to fun and club runners, who raised a record £66.4m for charity in 2019, next year’s London Marathon will also be pushed back from its traditional April slot to 3 October 2021 to allow more time for a Covid-19 vaccine to be found.In a letter to participants the event director, Hugh Brasher, said he appreciated there would be disappointment at the decision but organisers had no other choice.He said: “We had hoped by moving our event to October, by changing the way we organised the event and by using some amazing proximity technology that is about to be launched worldwide, we would be able to safely run or walk the 26.2 miles from Greenwich to Westminster and, in doing so, demonstrate one of the founding principles of the London Marathon – to show a sense of achievement in a sometimes troubled world.“However the recent surges in Covid-19 as lockdown was eased and the cancellation of the trial return of spectators at sporting events has stopped us in our tracks. Therefore we cannot embark on that intensely personal journey from Blackheath to Buckingham Palace, with the crowd cheering us on, with the gods of our sport leading the way, running together in mind, body and spirit with tens of thousands of people.”Organisers are hoping everyone with a place in the 2020 event will still run or walk the 26.2-mile marathon distance on 4 October, albeit not on the traditional London course, in order to raise money for charity and promote the benefits of good health. Brasher confirmed that everyone who does so would still get a coveted finisher medal and T-shirt – and that runners and charities would also be able to defer their place to a future London Marathon in 2021, 2022 or 2023.“While the London Marathon we know and love cannot take place on Sunday 4 October, I ask you to join us in a new London Marathon, on the same day, in the same spirit, but in a way that not only helps our charities with desperately needed fundraising, but also shows the spirit of our community is not dimmed and burns as brightly as ever,” said Brasher. “We believe that Sunday 4 October will be a London Marathon like no other. Together we will get through it. That is the spirit of the London Marathon.”Brasher also revealed organisers had spent five months working on a socially distanced mass-participation race, using revolutionary Bluetooth and ultra-wide ranging technology that would have alerted runners if they got too close to each other, only for the plan to be scuppered at the last moment.“This new technology would have enabled us to accurately monitor every participant’s distance from each other, work out if the participant spent more than 15 minutes within 1.5 metres (or any distance we set) of anyone else and then contact them post-event if anyone had informed us they had contracted Covid-19 in the two weeks after the event.”Brasher said the biggest challenge his team faced did not come from having 45,000 runners on the course – but the “multiple issues” of managing 750,000 spectators, the fears of a second spike and the concern about the pressures the race might put on the NHS. “Despite all our efforts it has not been possible to go ahead with a mass socially distanced walk or run.”Five elite athletes have been confirmed, with the long-awaited showdown between Kenya’s world marathon record holder, Eliud Kipchoge, and the world 5,000m and 10,000m record holder, Kenenisa Bekele, headlining the men’s race and Brigid Kosgei, the women’s world record holder, also going for her second London title. A number of other big names are expected to be confirmed in the coming weeks.Brasher said the race would conform to official World Athletics standards and insisted it was not unfeasible to expect a world record given the calibre of those competing and the new course. “It’s faster than the normal London Marathon course.”He added that while there would be no spectators cheering the elite athletes on in the biosecure bubble in St James’s Park, organisers planned to use “virtual reality crowds” to recreate the atmosphere of a big event."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/159d0726864307e4e5caff4bd6d4730361235233/0_953_3388_2032/master/3388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a3af6e98eeffdde547c109b1622df9b","title":"hamlet branagh rylance rickman in pictures tristram kenton","story":"In a new series, we delve into  photographer Tristram Kenton’s amazing archive of stage photos.

They booked a campsite in the Forest of Dean for two nights, and ordered “a load of random camping equipment”.“We hadn’t had much time to prepare because work had been so busy,” Chandler said. “Once we pulled all the stuff out of the garage, I thought, this is never ever going to fit. We got a puppy just before lockdown, so he was on my knee. The wine was under my feet, the kids were sat on all the bedding and pillows, and the back of the car was full.”Chandler admitted she had been “dreading” the trip, as rain was forecast and she was hesitant about having to set up the tent. However, the family had an “amazing” time.“Putting the tent up was far easier that we thought, although it didn’t take long for the dog to chew through one of the guy ropes,” she said. “Seeing the kids having the time of their lives was amazing, they had so much freedom, and we had time to read books, catch up on the news, and chill out.”The family have already booked two further trips. “I can’t see me giving up the villa just yet, but I can see us going camping for shorter breaks to get some time out,” Chandler said. “It forces you to unwind, and that’s really great.”Two weeks ago, John, 27, and a group of school friends headed for the Lake District for a camping trip to enjoy a ‘Covid safe’ holiday together.“I was very apprehensive at first, but this is the only way I could see them,” he said. “This seemed like the safest way to maintain a distance but still share in the warmth of each other’s company.”John, who lives in Portsmouth, had slept in tents during musical festivals, but had never been on a camping trip before, and was in for a rude awakening.“We went on a hike up a nearby hill, and the path was steep and treacherous. I’ve been on walks before, and I’m not out of shape, but this was a different beast. Part way up, the conditions got fairly bad, and we had the choice to keep going or go back down the horrible path. We carried on and didn’t get an awful lot better,” John said.“Apparently it wasn’t even a very big hill, one of the smallest in the Lake District,” he added.When they returned, John’s tent had been soaked by a nearby river and the surrounding area became a bog.“My friend saw the tent first and started crying with laughter. Me and my girlfriend were both drenched and miserable. We’d been holding on to the idea of a warm tent. We got in and salvaged what we could, mopped up and had to sleep in a damp tent. It was either that or drive six hours home into the night, so we thought we might as well just sleep in the puddle,” he said.Despite this, John said he would go camping again.“It’s not the sort of fun we’re used to in our normal lives, but it is good fun,” he said. “It’s cheaper than a usual holiday, and the Lake District is gorgeous, so really it’s not so bad.”In the Midlands, 48-year-old Kathryn’s camping plans didn’t progress very far.“On Saturday night, my husband and I, who are seasoned long haul travellers, made a rather impulsive decision to spend the best part of £1,000 on everything our little family would need to camp,” she said. “We’re both police detectives, so we did loads of research. We spent hours interviewing friends and family, and even had a spreadsheet.“Debit card at the ready, we ordered everything from the tent to the spare pegs, the airbeds to the camping stove, the head torches to the she-wee, the sleeping bags to the rubber mallets.”The family booked a campsite for the upcoming bank holiday and awaited their order. On Tuesday, they received an email from the store they had purchased the items from, saying that just one item was missing – the tent.“It was totally frustrating, but really funny,” she said. “Everywhere else is sold out, I think due to the demand from coronavirus. We’ve already booked the campsite but still have no tent. I’m so cross I’m going to return all 32 of the other items.”Ellen, 23, who works as an administrator at a care home recently went on her first camping trip with her boyfriend, and said the pair have “fallen in love” with camping.“We decided to take the plunge and go, as the idea of a foreign holiday was out of the picture and having spent most of lockdown apart we wanted to have a weekend away together,” she said.For a couple who “love an overseas adventure and a bit of luxury,” they have found an unlikely passion, and already rebooked for five weeks’ time.“We decided a three-night trip would be a good starting point,” she said. “We also managed to pick the hottest weekend of the year, which apart from it being a bit sweaty in the tent was amazing. We kind of felt like we had all the gear and no idea but off we went. By the end we felt like pros.”“We have absolutely fallen in love with camping, so much so we have decided to go again and are both so excited,” she added.Richard Kenchington recently took his first camping trip with his pregnant wife and young child after “taking the plunge” and buying a camper van in November, but said it wasn’t quite the enchanting ‘van lifestyle’ he had bought into.“It was one of those things we just decided. We were attracted by the lifestyle but we’d never tried it before, and jumped in feet first,” he said. “In theory it’s cheaper than foreign holidays, which currently are almost impossible.”During his trip in the Isle of Wight, Kenchington and his family experienced a gas leak in the camper van, and a tent collapse, and ongoing battles to encourage their four-year-old to following physical distancing.“The neighbours, in their much more expensive camper van, had to fix our tent when it collapsed. We came back and thought, we didn’t leave it like that, and the people next door told us they rescued it. The water bottle had gone everywhere and it was all wet,” he said. “You don’t expect that to happen, and have to tidy it all up with a four- year-old who wants to play. It did feel like one thing after another.”Despite this, Kenchington is determined to try again.“I don’t know if it’s because we enjoyed it, or because we bought the camper van and we have to use it. But we’re going to try again at the end of the month,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba827f6ce94c3b33f1b79f0c6ae954c524eef8d1/0_24_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c420dd45a90433883980ba5d9368942e","title":"los angeles parties covid 19 water power shutoff","story":"Eric Garcetti announces measure amid reports of hundreds gathering at mansions in violation of Covid regulations The Los Angeles mayor has announced a crackdown on house parties, authorizing the city to shut off water and power to homes that host events following reports of hundreds of people gathering in violation of Covid regulations.“These large house parties have essentially become nightclubs in the hills,” Eric Garcetti said on Wednesday, arguing the events can become “superspreaders” of coronavirus as bars and nightlife in the city remain shut.Starting on Friday night, the mayor announced, police are authorized to request that the city’s department of water and power disconnect service to houses and businesses within 48 hours, he said.The unusual threat comes as southern California continues to battle an alarming resurgence in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. Last month, Garcetti conceded that Los Angeles appeared to have reopened too soon, and the mayor has warned that he may have to order a return to stricter lockdown rules if the region is unable to control the outbreaks.Garcetti specifically pointed to a gathering Monday night at a mansion in the posh Beverly Crest neighborhood where hundreds of people appeared to have partied without masks or social distancing. Helicopter news footage showed a DJ on a balcony, people crowded around a pool and a food truck and dozens of cars on the long driveway.That party ended in a shooting that killed a woman and wounded two other people.Officers had been called to the mansion on Mulholland Drive hours before the shooting because of neighbors’ complaints. Police asked some people to move double-parked cars but did not break up the gathering, a police official said.Few people at the party appeared to be wearing masks or following guidelines for social distancing amid the pandemic, despite the city’s department of public health having banned parties of all sizes.Garcetti’s crackdown comes weeks after the controversial YouTube star Jake Paul threw a large house party in the nearby city of Calabasas, home to a number of celebrity mansions. Paul has faced widespread backlash for saying he was “not the type of person who’s gonna sit around and not live my life” in an Insider interview.On Wednesday, FBI agents, including a Swat team, served a search warrant at Paul’s mansion. The Calabasas mayor, Alicia Weintraub, has criticized Paul and said the city would be shutting down gatherings and issuing $100 fines to people not wearing masks.The pandemic has caused disproportionate suffering in high-poverty areas of southern California, and in LA county, Latino residents are twice as likely to have been infected than white people. Some of the most worrying outbreaks have taken place at workplaces, including garment factories and warehouse facilities where low-wage lack basic protections.As of Thursday, more than 9,800 people have died of the coronavirus in California.The Associated Press contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa5eebe93cccd4cad6ce624fde1033c69af67853/0_96_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e773734019d9216a53428f69d25d54ae","title":"beirut explosion lebanon tell us how you are affected","story":"If you have been affected by the events in Beirut you can share your experiences directly with our journalistsHospitals in the Lebanese capital of Beirut are buckling under the weight of casualties following an explosion in the city on Tuesday which killed at least 100 people and injured 4,000.More than 100 people remain missing, and many are feared to have been trapped under the rubble.

Efforts to treat the injured have been hampered by the fact that hospitals are among the damaged buildings.The blast was so powerful it was felt in Cyprus, 120 miles (193 km) away.Lebanon president, Michel Aoun, said 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had been stored unsafely in a warehouse for six years. After an initial blast and fire in the port, it is thought that this was the cause of a second blast, with a massive fireball and white cloud sending a shockwave across the city.Shop and apartment windows were blown out as far away as two miles (3.2 km) from the port, littering the streets with broken glass and causing hundreds of injuries.Video footage shows buildings next to the port area taking heavy damage as the shockwave spread through the city.Beirut’s governor has said that the blast damage extends to over half of the city, and that up to 300,000 people have been left homeless.Rescue teams are searching through debris in several neighbourhoods for missing people, while hospitals are overwhelmed with dealing with thousands of injured.Damage has been confirmed as far away as Beirut airport, six miles (9.5 km) from the blast site. A similar explosion in central London would see damage extend to the areas of Wood Green, Stratford and Forest Hill while the Bronx would have been affected if this happened in central Manhattan.The impact of the explosion can be gauged from aerial images showing the port before and after the blast.

People were “getting infected at family parties, at their place of work or at community facilities”. From Saturday, travellers returning to Germany from high-risk regions – currently most countries outside Europe, as well as Luxembourg and northern Spain – will face mandatory coronavirus tests unless they can show a negative recent result.If the infection rate continued to rise, Spahn said, schools and shops should remain open but tighter restrictions were likely on the size and type of gatherings permitted. “Freedom goes hand in hand with responsibility,” he said.President Jair Bolsonaro dismissed the disease as a “little flu” as it rampaged through his country and mocked measures\u0026nbspsuch as wearing masks. Two health ministers have quit and Brazil\u0027s outbreak is the second-deadliest in the world. India brought in a strict nationwide lockdown in March that slowed the spread of the virus but did not bring it under control. As the country began easing controls, cases surged and it now has the third highest number. Mortality rates are low, but it is unclear if this reflects reporting problems or a relatively resilient population.Iran had one of the first major outbreaks outside China. A lockdown slowed its spread but after that was eased in April, cases rebounded. Several senior officials have tested positive, and the government has strengthened controls, including making masks obligatory in public places.Israel had an early travel ban and strict lockdowns, and in April the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared the country an example to the world in controlling Covid-19. But cases that in May were down to just 20 a day, skyrocketed after the country started opening up. Partial controls have been brought back with warnings more could follow.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador joined other populists from across the political spectrum in dismissing the threat from coronavirus when schools closed in March he shared a video of himself hugging fans and kissing a baby. The outbreak is now one of the worst on the continent.A strict lockdown from March to June kept the disease under control but shrank the economy for the first time in 20 years. Cases have climbed steadily since the country started coming out of lockdown, and President Rodrigo Duterte has said the country cannot afford to fully reopen because it would be overwhelmed by another spike.Coronavirus was slow to arrive in Russia, and travel bans and a lockdown initially slowed its spread, but controls were lifted twice for political reasons – a military parade and a referendum on allowing Putin to stay in power longer. Despite having the fourth biggest outbreak in the world, controls are now being eased nationwide.Cases are rising rapidly, hospitals are full and doctors exhausted. But the government has rowed back from plans to bring back lockdown controls, after two days of violent protests. Critics blame the sharp rise in cases on authorities who allowed mass gatherings in May and elections in June. Officials say it is due to a lack of sanitary discipline, especially in nightclubs.South Africa has by far the largest outbreak on the African continent, despite one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. Sales of alcohol and cigarettes were even banned. But it began reopening in May, apparently fuelling the recent rise in cases.The US ban on travellers from overseas came late, and though most states had lockdowns of some form in spring, they varied in length and strictness. Some places that were among the earliest to lift them are now battling fast-rising outbreaks, and the country has the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths. Opposition to lockdowns and mask-wearing remains widespread.In Spain, the northern region of Castilla y León ordered a town of 32,000, Aranda de Duero, back into confinement for two weeks after 230 cases of the virus were detected, days after two smaller towns in the same region were returned to lockdown following outbreaks.The regional government of the Basque country, meanwhile, has said there is no longer any doubt that it is facing a second wave of the epidemic.Speaking on Thursday after 338 new cases were diagnosed in the region, the health minister, Nekane Murga, warned people not to underestimate the virus.“There’s no reason to think the virus is now weaker or less deadly,” she said. “It has the same capacity to spread and infect people as it did in March. It’s infecting more people on a daily basis and it can kill.”Spain has recorded 35,4o7 new cases in the past two weeks. On Thursday, the health ministry said the total number of cases had risen to 309,855. The latest tally included 4,088 new cases, 1,683 of them diagnosed over the past 24 hours.In France, meanwhile, experts said that with many staff on holiday, an already disorganised testing regime was struggling.“The virus hasn’t disappeared at all ... Contamination is continuing and amplifying in some regions,” François Blanchecotte, the president of the Union of Medical Biologists, told the Associated Press. “We have to adapt the testing strategy.”On Wednesday the country reported its biggest jump in daily confirmed cases since 30 May, with 1,695 positive diagnoses.Blanchecotte said tests should be organised at beach resorts or tourist sites rather than just in laboratories, and criticised a government campaign to test 1.5 million Parisians just as dozens of facilities were shutting down for holidays.The government now says it can test up to 700,000 people a week and hit a record high of 581,000 tests over the past week, but the number of new positive cases is growing twice as fast as the growth in test rates, the national health agency said.The strategic director of Finland’s health ministry, Liisa-Maria Voipio-Pulkki, said on Thursday that the virus was accelerating, with the R number, or reproduction rate, rising to between 1.1 and 1.4, and localised lockdown measures, plus a recommendation to wear face masks, likely to be announced in an “autumn roadmap” next week.Most of the springtime lockdown restrictions have been lifted in Finland, which has reported 7,512 infections and 331 Covid-19 deaths so far. Large indoor and outdoor gatherings are permitted, restaurants and bars are open as normal and children are due to return to class next week after the summer holidays.“The situation is extremely delicate,” Voipio-Pulkki said. “Some sort of second stage has begun. Whether we can expect a smaller wave or a larger wave depends on how we respond.”Poland said on Thursday it would re-impose compulsory face masks in all public spaces in nine areas as the number of infections also hit a new record. The restrictions, also affecting sports and cultural events in those areas, mainly in the south and east, will come into force from Saturday. Face masks are currently obligatory in Poland in enclosed spaces such as shops and public transport, but not outdoors.“We need to wake up a bit,” said the health minister, Łukasz Szumowski, adding that the country as a whole should be vigilant. The ministry reported 726 new cases on Thursday, the highest daily number recorded so far.Covid-19 confirmed cases across Africa have accelerated and are close to hitting a million this week, and experts say low levels of testing in many countries means infection rates are likely to be higher than reported.In East Asia, the Philippines also recorded a jump of 3,561 new cases, to overtake neighbouring Indonesia as the country with the highest number of confirmed infections in the region: nearly 120,000.The coronavirus has infected more than 18.8 million people, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, and killed nearly 709,000 people around the world. The highest numbers of deaths have been recorded in the US, Brazil, Mexico, the UK and India."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056401d16c375ff241ee46ce816a0f3b2d2eaea2/0_100_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=04206c95e85d09f65d47e03986247358","title":"no lights no glass no money beirutis hamstrung in efforts to rebuild","story":"Tuesday’s explosion has dealt a further blow to a city that was already struggling with creaking infrastructure and limited resourcesThere is glass all over Beirut, but none of it is in the right places. Stooping to pick up a picture of her eldest son as a baby, Mathilde Abdo was careful not to prick her finger on the shards still sticking to the frame before she restored it to its rightful home on the bookshelf.Even though Abdo, her husband, George, and five of their nephews have spent the last two days clearing up the chaos caused by the port explosion that devastated the Lebanese capital city, they are not even close to returning to normality to their flat in Ashrafieh, one of the neighbourhoods hit hardest by the blast.“There is still glass everywhere. I think we might spend the rest of our lives picking pieces out of our clothes, our belongings,” she said. “I used to want my sons to come home after they finish university in France and contribute to Lebanon’s future. Now I will tell them to never come back. There is nothing for young people here.”The Abdos are one of hundreds of thousands of families across the city picking through the rubble of their homes to rescue shattered memories. Photographs, school trophies, treasured family heirlooms: much of it is gone, or wrecked beyond repair.The first funerals for some of the 137 confirmed dead were held on Thursday, as the search for those still buried under collapsed buildings across east Beirut continued. The Covid-19 shutdown, as well as the fact that the city usually empties out during the humid month of August, appear to have saved an untold number of lives - but the death toll is still rising steadily. More than 5,000 people have been injured, many unable to get proper care from ruined hospitals already filled with coronavirus patients.“We are doing what we can, but we are not getting any support from the government,” said Garen, a 21-year-old student volunteering to search the wreckage. He and other amateur rescuers stood outside a damaged building in the heart of the Gemmayze nightlife district that residents fear will totally collapse. As the city starts to recover from the shock of Tuesday’s unprecedented explosion, which appears to have been caused by a massive stash of ammonium nitrate stored illegally at the port since 2014, Beiruitis are starting to comprehend the scale of the task of rebuilding that lies ahead.About 300,000 people have been made homeless and it is not clear how much of east Beirut’s infrastructure can be saved. Many of the low-rise buildings in working-class districts to the east of the port, razed several times in the civil war already, are expected to be earmarked for demolition. The cost of the damage could exceed $5bn (£3.8bn), Beirut’s governor, Marwan Abboud, estimated on Wednesday.The Abdos, both teachers, have already lost savings in the economic crisis that has engulfed Lebanon since late last year. “We already had so many problems in this country,” said George. “We could not imagine that not having money to rebuild our home is one of them. And we have to stay here in case there is looting.”Dahiyeh, the sprawling Hezbollah stronghold that makes up most of Beirut’s southern suburbs, was the scene of the city’s last major emergency when it was ripped apart by Israeli bombs during the 2006 summer war. This time around, Dahiyeh has escaped unscathed, and construction workers and craftsmen from the rest of the city have made rare ventures south in a search for building supplies and glass.At a glass warehouse in the Dahiyeh neighbourhood of Laylaki, dozens of men were busy cutting huge sheets of glass and trying to salvage useable panes from the broken windows and panels that have been brought to them over the last two days.“Normally I’m so bored at the shop I would love to talk to anyone new, but I’m so busy now, I can’t even think,” said the warehouse manager, who gave his name as Ali. “Using the cheapest glass we have, you can repair a normal-size window for about $8. The problem is that because of the financial crisis, no one has dollars any more.”“On top of that, we import almost all of our stock from places like Germany and Saudi Arabia. Now the port is destroyed. So once we sell what we have, that’s it.”The official rate for the Lebanese pound was 8,000 to the dollar on Thursday – more than four times what it was last year, when it was pegged at 1,500LBP to $1. Inflation triggered nationwide protests for months beginning last October. How to rebuild half a city with no money and no materials is the latest challenge facing a country that has finally broken after 30 years of post-civil war mismanagement, negligence and corruption.On a crisis visit to Beirut on Thursday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, inspected the damage as crowds formed around him demanding that any international aid or an International Monetary Fund bailout does not go towards bailing out a political class that has dragged Lebanon into a fresh disaster.After sunset, the clean-up teams were forced to abandon their work because of the poor light: electricity, in short supply at the best of times, is now totally gone, and almost all the generators that used to keep the lights on have been destroyed.Instead, crowds of young volunteers marched to Martyrs’ Square in the heart of the city, the scene of the hopeful protests at the end of last year. “Revolution!” they shouted through masks, waving brooms and flags in the air.Under a nearby highway bridge, street art blossomed during the 2019 demonstrations. “Before I die I want Lebanon to …,” one piece read. In green spray paint below, someone had written:“Learn from the past.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3855bcff6c436d0dfe5ae1826dbc41bdffb1a555/0_130_2324_1394/master/2324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=073567acb5c5bc3ef30458fd3c11238d","title":"pope appoints six women to top roles on vatican council in progressive step","story":"Former Labour minister Ruth Kelly is among the women who will oversee Vatican finances and address its cashflow problemsPope Francis has appointed six women to oversee the Vatican’s finances including Ruth Kelly, the former Labour minister, in the most senior roles ever given to women within the Catholic church’s leadership.The appointments mark the most significant step by Francis to fulfil his promise of placing women in top positions. Until now, the 15-member Council for the Economy was all male. By statute, the council must include eight bishops – who are always men – and seven laypeople.“That six are women is a pretty big quota,” said Joshua McElwee, the Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. “But the important thing here is that these six women are part of a group that essentially oversees all of the financial activities of the Vatican, so obviously that’s a pretty top-level group.”The female appointees are all European and have high-profile financial backgrounds. Leslie Ferrar, a former treasurer to Prince Charles, is the other British woman among the team. The other women are Charlotte Kreuter-Kirchhof and Marija Kolak, both from Germany, and Maria Concepción Osácar Garaicoechea and Eva Castillo Sanz, both from Spain. The only layman on the council is Alberto Minali, a former director general at Generali, the Italian insurance company.The appointments come as the Vatican struggles with its finances, with problems worsened by the coronavirus pandemic and a sharp drop in the number of visitors to the Vatican Museums, a cash cow for the Holy See.Francis created the Council for the Economy in 2014. “It is essentially the board of surveillance for everything financial within the Vatican, with the only person above it being Pope Francis,” said McElwee.Other women who have obtained prominent positions during Francis’ papacy include Barbara Jatta, who heads up the Vatican Museums, and Francesca Di Giovanni, the undersecretary of the Vatican’s secretariat of state.Kelly, 52, was an economics correspondent for the  for four years in the 1990s, and went on to hold a number of cabinet posts and ministerial positions in Labour governments under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, heading up the departments of education, transport, and communities and local government. In the latter role she was also the women’s minister.At the age of 36, she was the youngest woman to sit in a British cabinet. But Blair’s surprise appointment of Kelly to be education secretary ruffled feathers among colleagues who believed others were better qualified. She had four children – the first born 11 days after the 1997 election – in her first five years as an MP.Her devout Catholicism and membership of Opus Dei – a secretive, highly conservative and influential group within the Roman Catholic church – antagonised campaigners for women’s and LGBT rights. She rejected calls to break with the group, saying: “It is a private spiritual life and I don’t think it is relevant to my job.”But she ruled out working at the Department of Health because of her opposition to abortion, and at the Department for International Development because it promoted the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIVAids.She also came under fire for sending her son, who had dyslexia, to a £15,000-a-year private school.Kelly resigned from the cabinet in 2008, saying she wanted to spend more time with her family, and she did not stand in the 2010 election. She joined HSBC, and moved in 2015 to St Mary’s University, Twickenham.Farrer, 65, spent seven years as treasurer to the Prince of Wales, and before that worked for KPMG. Since leaving the royal household she has held a number of non-executive directorships, including at the Institute for the Works of Religion, more commonly known as the Vatican bank."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18c45b0a6f3f233795fe8d604d7723dd15fea23f/575_793_6145_3687/master/6145.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4d774e61cc71768ca74087e270679b36","title":"rare bearded vulture chick born in picos de europa flies the nest","story":"The bird is the first to be born within the mountain range in northern Spain for 75 yearsThe first bearded vulture born among the crags of Spain’s Picos de Europa mountains in 75 years has left the watchful gaze of her parents and taken to the sky.The chick, named Bienvenida (Welcome), was born in March to Deva, a 10-year-old female, and and Casanova, a 13-year-old male.By the middle of the 20th century, the bearded vulture had been hunted to extinction in the Picos de Europa, which stretch across three regions of northern Spain. A joint project between the regional government of Aragón and the Foundation for the Conservation of the Bearded Vulture (FCQ), supported by the Spanish government, has been working to restore the species to one of its former habitats.Although there are now 26 bearded vultures in the Picos de Europa – most of them reintroduced since 2010 – Bienvenida is the only such animal to be born in the wild there.“After 140 days in her parents’ care, Bienvenida the chick has left the cave that housed her nest and begun to fly,” the FCQ said in a statement. “Thanks to some chick feather and skin found beneath the nest, FCQ experts and specialist vets have been able to use DNA analysis to establish that the bird is a female.”The foundation added: “She has been named Bienvenida in reference to the social context into which she was born. The situation today when it comes to preserving and appreciating Spain’s bioersity is far more favourable than it was in the mid-20th century, when this species became extinct after decades of persecution.”In June, experts tried to carry out a check-up on the new arrival and to set up some satellite tracking equipment, but their efforts were apparently thwarted by “the chick’s very active behaviour”.The bearded vultures of the Picos de Europa are now Spain’s third largest reproductive population of the birds, behind other groups in the Pyrenees and Andalucía.The bird is known in Spanish as the quebrantahuesos, or bone-breaker, because of the way it drops bones from a great height so they shatter and yield their marrow.In English, the bearded vulture is also known as the lammergeier – German for “lamb vulture” – because of the false old belief that they killed sheep and lambs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfda0253072476d8c0b2d5107a8f750fa0442267/0_433_3299_1979/master/3299.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91cc6b090a8ec7a13695f9525f607791","title":"beer brand and leather store unwittingly named after maori word for pubic hair","story":"Canada’s Hell’s Basement and a shop in Wellington both thought the word ‘huruhuru’ meant ‘feather’ – they were wrongA Canadian brewery and a leather store in New Zealand have found themselves in a hairy situation after using te reo Māori to unwittingly name their respective brands after pubic hair.Canadian brewery, Hell’s Basement, called its New Zealand Pale Ale Huruhuru, while a shop in the New Zealand capital, Wellington, gave its entire outlet the name.“Some people call it appreciation, I call it appropriation,” te reo Māori exponent and TV personality Te Hamua Nikora said on Facebook, after explaining that most Māori would use the word “huruhuru” as a reference to pubic hair.Nikora said he had contacted both the store and the brewery informing them of their mistake.“If you are selling leather, call it leather, don’t call it pubic hair unless you are selling pubic hair and don’t call beer pubic hair unless you make it with pubic hair.”He asked for non-Māori businesses to use their own language to promote their products.Hell’s Basement co-founder, Mike Patriquin, acknowledged in a statement to the news site RNZ that the company thought that huruhuru meant “feather” and didn’t realise it was a reference to pubic hair.“We did not realise the potential to offend through our artistic interpretation, and given the response we will attempt to do better in the future,” Patriquin said.He said it was not the company’s intent to infringe upon, appropriate, or offend the Māori culture or people in any way.“To those who feel disrespected, we apologise. We also do not think pubic hair is shameful, though we admit it may not go well with beer.”A spokesperson from Wellington leather store Huruhuru also said they had meant no offence by the name of their outlet, which they also intended to mean wool, feather, or fur.Like the brewery, they consulted a Māori dictionary online to settle on the name. However, they did not have the money to undergo a rebrand.Two years ago, Coca-Cola’s attempts to combine te reo Māori and English backfired, when the company inadvertently wrote “Hello, Death” on a vending machine in New Zealand stocked full of the drink. The machine was emblazoned with the words “Kia ora, Mate”, which translates as “Hello, Death”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c38e58cae2fad778038677eb5d2c332cd30000/0_148_5581_3349/master/5581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd4c304bdeb5fb672dccb26fa9518ff4","title":"hiroshima marks 75th anniversary of atomic bombing in pictures","story":"City remembers world’s first atomic bombing with downsized ceremonies due to coronavirus and mayor urging nations to reject nationalism and unite to fight all threats"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Government must now produce a new compliant National Mitigation PlanEnergy companies bid against each other for contracts of 16.5 years to provide serviceThe combination of sea-level rise, storm surges and high tides could expose an extra 23 million people to coastal flooding by 2050"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Inidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping change"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Video: RTÉ \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Brady Family Ham facility in Timahoe, Co Kildare where 80 employees tested positive for Covid-19. Photograph: Laura Hutton Public health officials have refused to rule out a “Midlands lockdown” in response to a big surge in Covid-19 cases in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly.People living in the three counties have been warned to “double down” on following public health advice in order to minimise their risk of being infected, and older people have been advised to limit their social networks, “stay distant” and avoid public transport if possible.The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) said it would provide further “guidance” and information, once it has information on contact tracing for the latest batch of cases from the area. It has also written to local GPs to outline its concerns.The surge in cases in the region is largely linked to outbreaks in food processing plants and, to a lesser extent, clusters in three direct provision centres.The three counties accounted for 226 new cases in the past 14 days, or 48 per cent of the national total, with another 60 provisional cases expected to be confirmed in Friday’s official figures.While there is little evidence of community transmission as of yet, the Midlands cases constitute a “very large reservoir” of disease and there is a “real risk” of community spread from them in the coming weeks, according to Prof Philip Nolan, chairman of the NPHET Irish epidemiological modelling advisory group.More than 60 per cent of recent cases involve the close contacts of confirmed cases and were picked up during testing during outbreaks, officials said. The proportion of cases involving community transmission, where the cause of infection is not known, has remained constant at 20 per cent, while travel-related cases have declined.As a result, the reproduction number – a measure of the number of people infected by a case – has risen from 1.3 last week to about 1.8 now.‘Serious concern’Prof Nolan said a reproduction number of almost two was a “serious concern” and posed a “real risk” of an increase in community transmission in the coming weeks.The trend “emphasises the need for us to be extraordinarily cautious”, he told the NPHET briefing on Thursday evening.The plants affected by outbreaks are in Tullamore, Co Offaly, Kildare town and Timahoe, Co Laois. In a statement on Thursday night, a spokeswoman for O’Brien’s Fine Foods in Timahoe confirmed that 80 of its employees had tested positive for the virus and testing continues on dozens more.Production has been shut down at the family-run Brady’s Ham plant, and management said it was “difficult to comprehend” the sudden spike given the “level of rigour and our comparatively low level of confirmed cases up to this point”. Five Covid-19 deaths were reported by NPHET on Thursday, four of them delayed notifications. Another 69 new cases were also reported, only two of which involved community transmission.Doubling of casesReporting a general worsening of the situation, Prof Nolan said the average number of new cases per day more than doubled in the past week, while the number of people hospitalised stopped declining.Chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn warned on Thursday night that where cases lived was as important as the location of facilities where outbreaks occurred, and people across the three counties “need to be careful”. Asked whether NPHET might introduce a lockdown in the Midlands, he said nothing could be ruled out but he did not want to pre-judge the latest cases before the results of contact tracing had been properly examined.Dr Glynn called on residents of the three counties to pay particular heed to possible symptoms of Covid-19, and to self-isolate quickly and contact their GP if these occur.People should “double down” on their public health behaviour by adhering to 2 metres social distance, avoiding crowded spaces, washing their hands and using face-coverings where necessary.People in the three counties who are aged over 70 or are medically vulnerable are being advised to limit the number of people they meet to a very small network, for short periods of time, and to remain physically distant.If taking exercise outdoors, they should maintain a distance of at least 2 metres from others and wash their hands immediately once they return home, Dr Glynn recommended.Officials said they were concerned about four “significant” outbreaks, involving more than 150 cases, in the facilities. There are also clusters in three direct provision centres in the Midlands but Dr Glynn said he was “not unduly concerned” about these as they appeared to be under control.Many of the cases, and their contacts, have been transferred to the isolation centre at Citywest in recent days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324171.1596755041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"production at brady s ham plant in kildare stops after 80 staff test positive for covid 19","story":"Dr Ronan Glynn has asked people living in Kildare, Laois and Offaly to double down on basic public health behaviours following a spike in Covid-19 cases in the region.

Photograph: Laura HuttonThe .More than one-quarter of staff working for one of the country’s best known cooked ham brands have tested positive for Covid-19 in a huge outbreak that bosses say has left them mystified. Production has been shut down at the family-run Brady’s Ham plant in Timahoe, Co Kildare, after the virus spread and infected at least 80 employees. Testing continues on dozens more. Management said it is “difficult to comprehend” the sudden spike given the “level of rigour and our comparatively low level of confirmed cases up to this point”. There were two isolated cases in May. Mass testing of the 300-strong staff was ordered on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday following a decision by management and the Health Service Executive over the weekend. The first confirmed case of the cluster was on Thursday last week. Some 243 tests have been completed since and 42 are ongoing. The company said a “very high” number of positive cases were asymptomatic.Outsourced testers were hired in to help accelerate the response. A spokeswoman for O’Brien’s Fine Foods, which runs the plant, said all close contacts of those infected have been asked to self-isolate and the factory was undergoing a deep clean.“Since the first cases of Covid-19 were identified in Ireland last February, we have operated with an abundance of caution and safety,” she said, adding that the plant had been “fully audited by the relevant inspectors” in recent months with “no issues identified”. The outbreak is the latest in a number of clusters centred at meat factories in Co Kildare, provoking concerns among local family doctors, politicians and the public. The Kildare Chilling Company meat plant in Kildare town, which employs 350 people, confirmed a “number of Covid-19 cases” at the factory, but declined to disclose the exact figure.Irish Dog Foods, in Naas, remains closed for a second week after between 30 and 40 cases were confirmed at the plant. A company spokesman refused to disclose the total number of staff who have tested positive to date for the virus. Local reactionAllan Shine, chief executive of the County Kildare Chamber, said meat factories were among “the hardest businesses to control mainly due to their nature of business and the number of people employed”. The spokeswoman for O’Brien’s Fine Foods said staff at the company “receive full pay for any Covid-related illness or absence”.Dr Brendan O’ Shea, a Newbridge GP who represents the county in The Irish College of General Practitioners, said doctors “are concerned” but “not surprised or panicked” at the spike in cases.“Clearly the rise in cases is a concern, but we are now in quite a different position than we were in March,” he added. Dr Cathal Berry, Independent TD for Kildare South, linked the clusters to an “almost invisible cohort of workers in our society, mostly in low-paid and unskilled jobs, who may also be foreign nationals, who are living with others often in cramped accommodation due to the cost or renting or buying property”.An ongoing poll has found nine in 10 migrant meat factory workers do not get sick pay. Bríd McKeown, workplace relations co-ordinator at Migrant Rights Centre Ireland (MRCI), said it is “outrageous” workers are worried about losing wages if they fall ill or ring in sick during the pandemic.Almost six in 10 of the more than 15,000-strong workforce in the meat processing industry are migrants, according to MRCI. It has polled almost 100 in recent weeks in a continuing study into their conditions. Workers in some plants say they still do not feel safe as employers – some of whom “have a poor health and safety record” – are being trusted to “completely manage” the response to the crisis, said Ms McKeown. “Ultimately money seems to be the bottom line here and a lot of workers feel like the meat is treated better than they are. One said if the infection was in the meat, plants would close,” she said. Language barriers meant Covid-19 advice was not being properly communicated to some migrant workers, who are mostly Polish, Lithuanian, Romanian, Latvian, Moldovan, Slovakian, Brazilian, South African, Botswanan and Filipino. Another concern is losing their immigration status – which is tied to their work permit – if they raise concerns about working conditions, said Ms McKeown. “Workers tell us that if they say anything their employer says they’ll send you back to Brazil or wherever. Employers know full well the power they have.” While those on work permits can technically change employer it is “extremely difficult and costly to do so. And even if they do, it is within the same sector.” Ms McKeown criticised the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) – which is responsible for oversight of workplaces – for forewarning employers about inspections. “Workers say they can see when a workplace is getting ready for an inspection, with some staff given the day off, and signage being put up in the 48 hours prior to inspectors arriving,” she added. Workers also complained that there has been no easing in production during the crisis, with staff at some plants worried about a “backslide” in coronavirus measures – particularly around distancing, wearing masks and congregating in common areas. Almost half (48 per cent) felt measures were not being fully implemented, while nearly six in 10 (59 per cent) didn’t feel safe at work. Meat Industry Ireland (MII), which represents the industry, said protocols for factories are “robust and every possible measure is being deployed in our members’ processing facilities . . . Assertions to the contrary are misleading,” it said. Outbreaks in factories are a “stark reminder of the persistent threat of Covid-19 and the relentless effort and focus that has to be maintained to keep it out of processing plants, protect staff, and at the same time, keep the food supply chain in operation”. MII senior director Cormac Healy has previously told an Oireachtas committee some companies offer sick pay and some do not. “I don’t know the overall position across the industry,” he said.Concern over spreadThe HSA said it has carried out 2,731 Covid-related workplace inspections between May 18th and July 31st. The vast majority are unannounced “but there are circumstances where advance notification may be required”, said a spokeswoman. “For example, where it is essential for inspectors to meet with specific iniduals at the place of work or to ensure a particular activity is active so as to allow inspectors to observe.” The HSA said it is working with the National Outbreak Control Team to address ongoing flare-ups in meat factories. The Government’s decision to further postpone an easing of lockdown restrictions this week followed a warning by acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn about “significant and growing” concern over how the disease is spreading. The Department of Health and the HSE were asked to comment on the findings. “Multiple significant outbreaks” in workplaces, particularly food factories and construction sites, as well as direct provision centres, are driving a shift in its transmission away from Dublin to other counties, Dr Glynn cautioned. Of 51 outbreaks in workplaces, almost half (24) were in meat factories. Nine are ongoing, including four at meat plants, involving 94 cases. Of four new workplace clusters over the last week, half were at meat plants, which accounted for 47 of the 57 overall cases. Community transmission remains “reasonably low” with a majority of cases accounted for within known outbreaks and close contacts, but Dr Glynn told the Government there is a continued and heightened risk that rising numbers of cases could mean community transmission surges in coming weeks.

Photograph: Andrew MilliganPA WireLongford-born journalist Peter Geoghegan was sitting in a train carriage in Newcastle just before the Brexit referendum in 2016 when a quest began to unravel a mystery about the Democratic Unionist Party’s role in winning it.Flicking through a “well-thumbed copy” of the  newspaper, Geoghegan, who works now in Glasgow and London, saw the free newspaper’s front page “wraparound” advertisement.In it, British voters were urged to “Take back control”, the slogan of the official Vote Leave campaign,” Geoghegan recalls in his new book, Democracy for Sale, which is published by Head of Zeus on Thursday.“I turned the paper over. An imprint on the back said that the advert had been ‘paid for by the Democratic Unionist Party’,” says Geoghegan, a journalist with opendemocracy.net.“This was very curious. Since its foundation in 1971, the Democratic Unionist Party had never run a single candidate outside Northern Ireland, ” he writes.It was a little epiphany that ultimately led him down a number of other tracks and has resulted in the book.It is filled with the likes Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and a former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence, Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud.Right there, too, is the DUP, which spent £435,000 “on a massive ad campaign promoting Brexit in England. I knew that election spending in the UK is tightly capped.”“I also knew, having worked as a reporter in Belfast, that political donations to Northern Irish parties were kept secret under anachronistic local laws. Perhaps this was a way around campaign limits?”So, would he solve the mystery?Geoghegan contends in Democracy for Sale that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign because Vote Leave had almost used up its permitted spending of £7 million.Vote Leave and the DUP have denied the claim.Uncommunicative groupOther organisations on both sides of the campaign were allowed additional spending of up to £700,000. The author recounts how he discovered that an uncommunicative organisation called the Constitutional Research Council (CRC) donated £435,000 to the DUP to support the Leave crusade.To prop up his Vote Leave-DUP connection conviction, Geoghegan writes, “Two months before the referendum, Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, wrote in an email to senior staff: ‘The DUP also have a £700k spending limit, which can be spent nationwide!’ ”“At that stage the DUP had yet to register as a referendum participant,” Geoghegan writes. “It only did so in late May. When the CRC started giving money to the DUP, Vote Leave had almost completely exhausted its spending allowance.”Geoghegan writes how the DUP’s Brexit “spending spree began on June 9th, exactly two weeks before the vote, when the DUP bought £100,000 worth of placards, bags, window stickers, T-shirts and badges from a small branding agency called Soopa Doopa”.This company was based in the Cambridgeshire cathedral town of Ely. The location and the company was a “surprising choice” for the DUP, thought Geoghegan. The fact that it published more than £800,000 of material for various Leave-supporting groups reinforced his belief that this was part of the alleged Vote Leave-DUP nexus.Two days before polls opened, Geoghegan writes, the CRC donated a further £334,993 to the DUP, much of which was spent on the wraparound ad in the  – a paper that does not circulate in Northern Ireland.He also says the DUP spent £32,000 on digital advertising through a Canadian company called AggregateIQ (AIQ) which had “bought millions of pounds worth of Facebook ads on behalf of a suite of pro-Brexit campaigns clustered around Vote Leave”.The Westminster “fake news” inquiry that began in 2017 and concluded in 2019 heard that AIQ had links with Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm founded by US billionaire Robert Mercer and US president Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, although this has been denied by AIQ co-founder Zack Massingham.Cambridge Analytica got in serious trouble over allegedly misappropriating digital information, including acquiring the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users.Front organisationGeoghegan, following the money trail, writes that “according to Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie, the DUP were simply a front organisation to allow Vote Leave to go beyond spending limits imposed by election laws” – again a charge that Vote Leave and the DUP strongly deny.Geoghegan explores how the only publicly known person associated with the CRC – the group that gave the £435,000 to the DUP – is Scottish businessman Richard Cook, a Conservative Party activist and Glasgow Rangers supporter.He is depicted as a colourful figure, who in 2013 jointly founded a company called Five Star Investments with Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, a former director general of the Saudi intelligence agency who died in 2015. Cook held 5 per cent of the shares, the prince 75 per cent, and a third man, Danish national Peter Haestrup, held the other 20 per cent.Haestrup was allegedly linked to an Indian gun-running case known as the Purulia Arms Drop. Haestrup told Geoghegan he was never charged, had a “100 per cent clean record” and had done nothing wrong. He also explained how the wealth management business did not get off the ground and was dissolved in 2014 after “a lot of good dinners”.Despite these intriguing connections, Geoghegan portrays Cook as a man who would not have £435,000 to easily hand over to the DUP. He is convinced the CRC money came from other sources. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told Geoghegan that Cook, his long-time political adversary in East Renfrewshire, was “a bizarrely unlikely middle-man for this sort of money”.In addition to the £435,000, the author writes about how the CRC made two further contributions to the DUP after the Brexit referendum, totalling more than £13,000 – the DUP very generally and impenetrably saying it had used the money to “further the cause of unionism at home and abroad”.Geoghegan writes that Cook refused to reveal the source of the cash and said that, although he had administered the massive DUP donation, he had never received any money from his involvement in the CRC. “I just run a small consultancy company, doing some waste energy stuff internationally,” he said.Elusive truthGeoghegan does a lot of mining to find the other CRC backers but, as he admits, the gold seam proves elusive, his work not helped by electoral law in Northern Ireland or the DUP’s refusal to answer questions.Under previous electoral legislation in the North, political donors during the Troubles did not have to disclose their names or the size of their contributions because doing so could endanger their lives.In July 2017 that changed when then northern secretary James Brokenshire decided that life had moved on and donation details could be published.It could have been the moment that changed everything. However, it was not to be. Brokenshire could have backdated that legislation to January 2014, but decided not to.This led to allegations that he had done a “side deal” with the DUP – a charge bolstered by the fact that this was at a time when the DUP had signed up to a £1.5 billion confidence and supply deal to keep then UK prime minister Theresa May’s Tory government in power.It prompted former head of the North’s Electoral Commission Seamus Magee to deduce: “The deal on party donations and loans must be part of the DUPConservative deal. No other explanation.”This was denied at the time by DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson.Geoghegan, still chasing, writes how, in mid December 2017, 17 MPs met in a Westminster committee room to consider a legal order that would bring donor transparency to Northern Ireland.During a “truncated and bad-tempered” debate, DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley, who were observers, insisted that their party had been wholly transparent about the £435,000 donation.Saying that the failure to backdate the legislation “stinks”, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw added: “The only conclusion that any reasonable person can draw is that the DUP was used, with its knowledge, by the CRC to funnel money to the Leave campaign in a way that to this day keeps the source of that money secret. By refusing to make this provision retrospective, the government are effectively complicit in covering that up.”In his book Geoghegan addresses many fascinating issues in relation to “dark money”, Brexit and political funding but in the end admits his investigation into the DUP and CRC does did not answer the big question.The wall of silence could not be penetrated. He concedes, “Just how much control the DUP had over its record donation and how it was spent remains unclear. And who was behind the money is still a mystery.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: PAWhat is happening with face coverings?From Monday, it will be mandatory to wear face coverings in shops and shopping centres. Prior to this it was an advisoryThere has been a spike in Covid-19 numbers in the Republic in recent weeks. The five-day average has gone from a low single figures per day to approaching 50 per day.The Government is fearful of a rise in community transmission (as in cases where the source of infection is not know) which could put the country back to where we were at the start of the pandemic.Initially it was thought masks were not an effective protection against the virus. At the beginning of the pandemic scientists did not realise how infectious Covid-19 was and thought the drawbacks of asking everybody to wear a mask outweighed the benefits.However, as the pandemic progressed, epidemiologists have changed their view and now believe face coverings can stop the spread of the virus.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recently found the correct use of face masks by people who are asymptomatic may help reduce the spread of infection in the community who otherwise may have unwittingly spreading the virus.A recent study across 198 countries found those with cultural norms of mask-wearing had lower death rates from Covid-19.It explains how places like South Korea and Japan, where there is a strong culture of mask-wearing, have lower death rates than western countries and the United States where they are not the norm.While Perspex shields are not as effective at stopping the virus or the spread of it, they are better than nothing.How do masks work? Masks work by stopping most of the droplets which occur when people cough, sneeze or talk. They are better at protecting you from other people than vice versa, but if everybody wears a mask, the impact can be dramatic.In one case, a man flew from China to Toronto and subsequently tested positive for Covid-19.He had a dry cough and wore a mask on the flight yet all 25 people closest to him on the flight tested negative for Covid-19.In another case, in the United States, two hair stylists had close contact with 140 clients while sick with Covid-19. Everyone wore a mask and none of the clients tested positive.How will mask wearing be enforced? The legislation allowing for compulsory face coverings is the same as that used for compulsory face coverings on public transport.The wearing of face coverings will be enforced by a statutory instrument under the Irish Health Act 1947 as amended in 2020.It allows for a fine of up to €2,500 or six months in prison.Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said the intervention of the gardaí will be a “last resort” when it came to enforcing the wearing of face coverings in shops and said there was a “huge level of compliance” already.Retail Ireland said it is “crucial that it does not fall to retail staff to ensure compliance”.The organisation’s director, Arnold Dillon, said enforcement of the measures should be left to the appropriate authorities and retail staff should not be exposed to “the potential disputes and discord that might arise”.So far the portents for mass compliance are good. The National Transport Authority says there has been 95 per cent compliance on public transport with the wearing of face coverings.NTA spokesman Dermot O’Gara said: “Compliance on face coverings has remained very high. The approach of engagement, education and encouragement seems to be working well.”A Government spokeswoman said she was not aware of any prosecutions for non-compliance with facemasks on public transport.Will everybody have to wear a face covering? As with public transport, no child under the age of 13 has to wear a mask in shops. Other exemptions are: those who cannot put one on, wear or remove a face covering because of any physical or mental illness, impairment or disability or without severe distress.Anyone who needs to communicate with another person who has difficulties communicating, as in someone who is hard of hearing, is also exempted.Will children have to wear face coverings in schools? The guidelines for children returning to school is that it is not practical for many students to wear a mask properly for the duration of a school day.Cloth face coverings are not suitable for children under the age of 13 and anyone over that age who has trouble breathing, or has special needs and who may feel upset or very uncomfortable, should not wear one either.Older students should not be requested to wear a facial covering but can opt to wear one if they wish.Teachers will not be required to wear face masks, as they conceal facial expression and can make communication difficult except in situations where physical distancing is impossible.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324167.1596744293!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach signals covid 19 impact on health and housing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin: ‘We’re still the largest party in the Dáil which gets forgotten. And our people need to realise that.’ Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said the substantial impact Covid-19 will have on the two key sectors of health and housing over the next year will present “huge challenges and worries” for the Government.In a stark assessment of the strain the pandemic will impose on health services the Taoiseach said waiting times and vital diagnostic services will be affected detrimentally with a serious knock-on affect for many other important areas.“The resumption of non-Covid medicine will be impacted significantly in terms of waiting times and diagnostics,” he said. “That’s a worry in terms of the early diagnosis of cancer, for heart disease and a range of other conditions people develop ordinarily in life, and would have been ordinarily detected . . . So these are huge challenges and worries for us. And that’s an ongoing impact of Covid,” he added. In an interview with The  Mr Martin also said that the continuing presence of Covid-19 would have an adverse impact on the Government’s ambitious plans for delivery of new housing, including affordable and social units. He said “without question housing construction figures are going to be impaired by Covid-19” because of social-distancing rules and of the shut down during the summer. That could result in the Coalition not reaching the targets for housing it has set out in the Programme for Government. Mr Martin said the combination of the July stimulus, the Government’s capacity to borrow, as well as unified action by the EU to the pandemic, ensured that the economy was on a solid footing well into 2021. However, in the shorter term he said the projected €30 billion deficit might have to be increased in 2020 in a situation where the health services were dealing simultaneously with the flu season and a continuing Covid-19 outbreak. “That will create particular specific challenges to the acute hospital system and the primary-care setting in particular. So, this is going to be very very challenging and protecting our people is the number one,” he said. Separately, in Department of Health documents officials have raised fears that almost 5,000 fewer hospital beds will be available because of the impact of the pandemic. The papers indicate that “there could be a shortfall in capacity, due to safe distancing requirements and reducing utilisation to 80 per cent, of 4,700 beds based on a current baseline of 11,000 beds”. Martin bullish on performanceThere is an objective of operating generally at 80 per cent capacity to run “safe levels of activity and comply with infection control measures”.Mr Martin also said his first month as Taoiseach had been frenetic but he had not been “fazed” by any of the events or controversies. He said he would have preferred not to sack former minister for agriculture Barry Cowen, but felt he had no alternative. He said he understood the anger of Fianna Fáil TDs who were not promoted to Government. Mr Martin added that despite setbacks the Government had achieved a lot in its first month including the July stimulus, return-to-school plan, resumption of North-South ministerial meetings and 11 pieces of legislation. On his personal situation, the Taoiseach said he believed the Government will serve its full term, that he will become tánaiste when the top roles are swapped in December 2022 and that he will lead Fianna Fáil into the next election. He has also rejected any suggestion his party is in demise following a poor general election. “I had all of this in 2011, the party would never recover, the party was going to be finished,” he said. “We’re still the largest party in the Dáil which gets forgotten. And our people need to realise that . . . We did suffer a setback in the election so we want to do much better. I acknowledge that there are lessons to be learned from that . . . But I take strength from the fact that we have a very good quality cadre of people in the parliamentary party.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNational Rifle Association  chief executive Wayne LaPierre speaks during the NRA’s annual convention in Dallas on May 4th, 2018. Photograph: Tamir KalifaNew York TimesThe New York attorney general has sued to dissolve the National Rifle Association, accusing its powerful leader, Wayne LaPierre, and a coterie of top executives of siphoning off millions of dollars from America’s formidable pro-gun lobbying group for their own benefit.Ms James is seeking to dissolve the NRA, which was founded in New York in 1871 as a charitable organisation, as well as to remove Mr LaPierre and other top executives and require them to pay restitution.In a press conference on Thursday, she framed the lawsuit as a classic case of a charity that had violated the law. Yet it comes just three months before a presidential election and is fraught with political undertones: Ms James is a progressive attorney general who campaigned, in part, on a promise to investigate President Donald Trump and his business empire.The NRA, in addition to being a gun rights lobby, is also part of the backbone of the modern conservative movement. It has used a vast war chest over the years to support favoured political candidates, including Mr Trump, who benefited from millions of dollars of NRA spending in the 2016 campaign on television advertising and get-out-the-vote operations. It has endorsed him again ahead of the November election.Even before Thursday’s action, however, the NRA had been beset by financial problems and infighting. Its spending in the 2018 midterm elections was down as major donors pulled back after accusing Mr LaPierre of mismanagement.Ms James denied that politics played any role in her decision, saying that her investigators had merely followed the facts.Trump responseCarolyn Meadows, the NRA’s president, called the suit “a baseless, premeditated attack” on her organisation and the second amendment right to bear arms.“You could have set your watch by it: the investigation was going to reach its crescendo as we move into the 2020 election cycle,” Ms Meadows said. Mr Trump told reporters the lawsuit was “a terrible thing” and suggested the NRA “move to Texas and lead a ... beautiful life” there.In the civil lawsuit, the New York attorney general laid out allegations of a web of self-dealing between top NRA executives, board members and favoured vendors that allowed them to enrich themselves while silencing dissenters.The complaint featured numerous examples of alleged misspending by NRA executives – including fancy dinners, cigar bar memberships and wedding expenses.Among other misdeeds, Ms James accused Mr LaPierre, who has been the NRA’s executive director for almost 30 years, of using the group’s funds to charter private planes for family vacations to the Bahamas at least eight times in the past three years. Mr LaPierre and his wife also went on safari in Africa at the NRA’s expense, according to the complaint.The suit also names Wilson “Woody” Phillips, the NRA’s former treasurer and chief financial officer Joshua Powell, its former chief of staff and John Frazer, its general counsel.Ms James said her investigation was ongoing and that she would refer any potential criminal misconduct to the Manhattan district attorney.Parallel suitThe Washington, DC attorney general filed a parallel suit on Thursday that accused the NRA of milking its charitable foundation for cash.The association “used its control over the foundation to raid the foundation’s funds” in order to plug cash flow problems, according to the lawsuit, which said the foundation had extended a $5 million short-term loan to the NRA in 2017.When that loan was paid back in March 2018, the association requested another $5 million loan. That second loan was extended twice and subordinated to other NRA debt, the lawsuit alleged.While the legal action is likely to deepen the NRA’s troubles, some worried that it might have unintended political consequences, coming just ahead of the election.“I don’t understand the timing of this, and I think a lot of people look at this and worry it will motivate Republican base voters in swing states,” one Democratic consultant said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"beiruts explosion years making","story":"Lord knows the Lebanese have suffered. They stumbled out of one of the most brutal civil wars in modern times and into a conflict with Israel. Just as it was recovering from that, neighbouring Syria exploded in protest - sending a wave of refugees its way.Lebanon miraculously buffered the storm, only to be hit by an economic crisis so deep it has plunged most of the country into poverty. Trauma - its citizens often grimly joke - has become part of the national psyche.Yet Tuesday’s explosion was something else. I fear it is more than anyone - even the famously resilient Lebanese - can bear.I spent more than four years in the capital, Beirut, as a Middle East correspondent for The . It’s a complicated and tumultuous place where tempers and passions run high. If you don’t fall in love with it, you’ve misunderstood it. If you don’t hate it, you’ve probably done something wrong.Anyone who has ever left it - which I did in February - knows you leave a piece of your heart behind.Checking in on Wednesday on friends and old neighbours who had become more like family, there was no good news. Most live in and around the historic entertainment district of Gemmayzeh, which is so close to the port that it was effectively a ground zero.One friend took shards of glass to her head and needed stitches, while one was found badly concussed by the site after he had raced down on his motorbike to report on the initial fire.My “Lebanese mother” Christina broke her arm when she was thrown by the blast’s force. Beirut’s health minister urged people to leave the city in case of any residual noxious fumes, but the 52-year-old mother of three - like most others - had nowhere else to go. She swept up the window fragments and put the broken frame back on her broken bed and tried to sleep.Another sobbed down the phone to me as she walked through a hole in her apartment where her front door had been: “Kil shi, kil shi (everything, everything) my whole life is gone.”  There’s little left of the places we used to frequent: Anise bar where we used to drown our sorrows after a tough day reporting the little fruit and veg shop on the corner and the New York Times reporter’s French mandate apartment where I had my farewell party.It is hard to overestimate the damage done to a country half the size of Wales. More than 300,000 people - a fourth of Beirut’s population - have been made homeless overnight. The anaemic state, without serious international help, is incapable of rebuilding. Many in Lebanon had predicted an explosion, though few could have imagined it would come in the form of the 2,750-tonne blast that would devastate half the city.It’s hard to pinpoint exactly where it all went wrong for Lebanon. The country - described in better times variously as the Paris of the Middle East for its glamour and the Switzerland of the region for its exemplary banking sector - had looked to be thriving in recent years.Tourist numbers were up, the beaches along its beautiful Mediterranean coastline were packed. The middle classes appeared more comfortable than they had ever been.For those who had money at least, Beirut was a pleasant enough place to live. But it belied a much more complicated reality.Lebanon had borrowed up to its eyeballs and it was only a matter of time before the bubble burst. Corruption and greed among its ruling class - warlords who had gripped onto power since the end of the civil war in 1990 - had helped bleed the country dry. The politicians didn’t even bother trying to hide it, simply blaming one another.Constant spats between the competing religious sects over who would be awarded the spoils had left them virtually incapable of governing.The problem with Lebanon, as Marwan Muasher, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, put it, is that “corruption has been democratised, it’s not sitting centrally with one man. It’s all over”.Beirutis on Tuesday began cursing their politicians before an official investigation was even underway. Experience had taught them that either incompetence or negligence would be behind the disaster, which has claimed the lives of at least 100 people and injured thousands more.Initial reports suggested that authorities had seized several-thousand tonnes of highly combustible ammonium nitrate and had been storing it at the port. The blast was suspected to have been triggered by a fire started by a welder.Questions will soon be asked as to who signed off on keeping such a large quantity of a volatile and explosive substance stored in a densely populated civilian area. “What exploded today in Beirut is not just ammonium nitrate. It is above all corruption, mismanagement, incompetency and cynical disregard for the security and lives of people,” wrote one local, Dyab Abou Jahjah, who expressed the thoughts of many of his countrymen.Karl Sharro, a well-known Lebanese architect and satirist, tweeted: “Negligence, incompetence, complacency, corruption, nepotism this immoral and parasitical political class has destroyed Beirut and the whole country.”By Wednesday, the phrase hang up the nooses was trending on Twitter in Lebanon.Lebanon had for months been teetering towards ruin.By the time I left Beirut in February there were daily street protests against government corruption. Saad Hariri, the prime minister (the son of a previous premier), stepped down only to be replaced by another equally loathed businessman.Then coronavirus hit. Lebanon had the sense to shut down - fearing that its already beleaguered hospitals would not be able to cope with a major outbreak. But the lockdown sent its poorest - rendered jobless - spiralling into even deeper poverty.At the same time, the country was beginning to feel the full effect of its free-falling economy. The country’s currency lost up to 80 per cent in value in a matter of weeks. Last month it became the first in the Middle East in history to experience hyperinflation.Its once proud and thriving middle class have been forced to sell their possessions in online markets.There was no point looking to the government for help, it had been unable to provide the basics to its people - including water and electricity - even during the “good times”.On Monday, the country’s foreign minister resigned, warning that a lack of vision and a will to implement reforms risked turning Lebanon into a “failed state”. There is little to suggest it can do much now to avoid its wretched fate.Thousands in the Lebanese capital would have had a restless sleep in their dark, hot and windowless homes on Tuesday night. The windows may have been knocked out by the blast, but the darkness was of the country’s own making.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sunny day hiroshima 75 years atomic bomb","story":"It is Monday 16 July 1945, 5.30 am, and a sodden night in the New Mexico desert is suddenly a sunny day.“The whole country was lighted by a searing light with the intensity many times that of the midday sun,” writes General Thomas Farrell, deputy commander of the Manhattan Project, the secret team in Los Alamos dedicated to creating the bomb. “It was golden, purple, violet, gray, and blue. It lighted every peak, crevasse, and ridge of the nearby mountain range with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined.”Just four hours after the ‘Trinity’ test, the first nuclear detonation in history, a ship leaves San Francisco, bound for Tinian Island in the South West Pacific. On board is Little Boy, only the second nuclear bomb ever created.That night the people of Hiroshima feel relatively safe. They have grown so used to American B-29 bombers passing overhead, they have nicknamed them ‘B-San’ or ‘Mr B’. Like the rest of the world, they have never heard of the atom bomb. They do not know that Hiroshima has deliberately been spared conventional bombing so its devastating effects will be clear. Little Boy’s final destination is still not set. The US Targeting Committee has narrowed the possible targets down to three: Hiroshima, Kokura and Nagasaki. The ultimate decision will be chosen based on prevailing weather conditions.6th August. 00.02 For the first time, the crew of the B-29 named Enola Gay is told what weapon they will be carrying. Captain William ‘Deak’ Parsons informs them it will be the most furious explosion since creation, that it might crack the Earth’s crust. In Hiroshima, it is a clear night full of shooting stars.02.45 The Enola Gay takes off. It has been named after pilot Colonel Paul Tibbett’s “courageous red-haired mother”. In Tibbett’s pocket are cyanide capsules, one for each member of his crew, in case of capture. As the aeroplane heaves itself into the air, the crew still do not know where they are heading.04.00 Dr Michihiko Hachiya, a physician at the Hiroshima Communications Hospital, finishes his air raid duty. There is nothing to report.06.41 Captain Parsons begins arming the warhead. He has taken it upon himself to do this en route, dismantling and reassembling Little Boy in the freezing bomb bay. Four heavily-laden B-29s have recently crashed taking off from the Tinian runway, which ends in a cliff. Little Boy weighs 9,700 lbs and required special sunken bays to be dug just to load it into the aircraft. The chance of catastrophe is too great.07.29 “The hour was early the morning still, warm, and beautiful,” Dr Hachiya noted in his diary. “Shimmering leaves, reflecting sunlight from a cloudless sky, made a pleasant contrast with shadows in my garden as I gazed absently through wide-flung doors opening to the south.”High above, the weather plane assigned to check conditions in Hiroshima ahead of the mission passes over the city. An air raid siren greets it, but it’s just Mr B making his rounds. Only now is the target set.08.14 Bombardier Thomas Ferebee on board Enola Gay spots the Aioi Hashi, a T-shaped bridge at the heart of the city. A tone warns the crew of the aircraft to brace themselves. The citizens of Hiroshima hear nothing but a distant thrum. There is no siren. The fireball is hotter than the surface of the sun. Almost everything within one mile of the centre is vaporised instantly. Winds of more than 650 miles per hour turn every shard of wood not immediately incinerated into shrapnel. One quarter of a city of 350,000 are killed instantly. The mountains that surround the city, which gave Hiroshima such pleasant weather, produce a ‘focussing effect’ for the shockwave.The bomb is a grotesque act of creation. It took some of the world’s finest and most creative minds, and $2 billion (more than £18 billion in today’s money), to bring it to life. At the moment of detonation it replaces the historic city of Hiroshima with something new. Hiroshima was known as Mizu no Miyako or the ‘City of Water’. Now it is, according to Dr Hachiya, “no longer a city but a burnt-over prairie”, a City of Fire.Naked survivors, the patterns of their clothes burned into their backs, wander dazed through the inferno, driven by an unbearable thirst. Many die in reservoirs, swimming pools and water tanks, or drown in the swift Ōta river. The outline of the sun through the dust is red. A black rain falls from the sky. Hiroshima is now, in a word repeated over and over again by survivors, “Hell.”It took J Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, 15 minutes to accept the possibility of fission, then a week to sketch Little Boy on his blackboard. He explained: “When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it.”Yet at heart, Little Boy was barely more sophisticated than a medieval cannon, firing a uranium bullet down a tube into a target. The scientists were so confident the contraption would work, they never bothered to test it. The Trinity ‘gadget’ and Fat Man, the bomb later dropped on Nagasaki, were more sophisticated ‘implosion’ devices.The technology developed quickly after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Massive weapons like the thermonuclear Tzar Bomba (thousands of times more powerful than Little Boy) gave way to missile defence shields like Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars, which in turn inspired smarter missiles. The creative spiral was only averted by bans and treaties that are now decaying. There are currently around 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world, down from a high of 70,000 in 1986. How does Little Boy compare to their power? Sharon Squassoni, a global security expert from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, bursts into laughter. It’s not reassuring.“There’s just no comparison, the shift in our nuclear arsenal is astounding. We have a wide range of power and capabilities. We even have bombs where you can dial in the yield before use.”Moreover, the trend towards smaller weapons designed for less indiscriminate destruction doesn’t necessarily make us safer. Seth Baum, executive director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, explains:“In military circles, the overall trend over the years has been away from mass destruction to precision, reducing collateral damage. However, the argument goes that precision actually makes it more likely that we might use them.”New and ever more versatile weapons are now on the horizon, from unpredictable hypersonic delivery systems designed to zig-zag past missile shields, to high-altitude strikes that would disable our electronics and communications networks.For some, the old ways are still the best. The relative simplicity of gun-type devices like Little Boy mean they are perfect for terrorists looking to assemble their own. With the proliferation of nuclear states and lax security in countries of the former Soviet Union, getting fissile material is less a problem than you might think. One Russian prosecutor in a case involving the theft of uranium noted that potatoes were guarded better. There is no reason why a modern-day remake of Little Boy would be any less powerful than the original, says Squassoni. “Of course it would be as powerful as Hiroshima. Little Boy was 15 kilotons – that’s a pretty small bomb.”The hard part has already been done. Creating the bomb was difficult. Recreating it isn’t.In the days afterwards, the explosion is named the ‘pikadon’ by survivors: “flash–bang”. However, those closest to the epicentre insist on calling it simply ‘pika’. They do not remember the boom, only the flare then an eerie silence, a moment of time caught in light like a camera flash.“I remember vividly how a stone lantern in the garden became brilliantly lit,” wrote Dr Hachiya.The atomic bomb uses light as a weapon. It converts matter into energy at the speed of light, and some of its designers had suggested sounding a “super powerful siren” before detonation, to blind anyone who looked up and happened to catch sight of the flash. The survivors were left with an unforgettable image.“That beautiful cloud! Its beauty defies description,” recalled a friend of Dr Hachiya. “I have never seen anything so magnificent in my life!”The doctor noted that “it was at the moment of the birth of this cloud, with its ever-changing colour, that Hiroshima was wiped out. It was at this moment that Hiroshima city, the culmination of many years\u0027 work, disappeared with her good citizens into the beautiful sky.”The ‘mushroom cloud’ became the bomb’s own trademark. It had to be seen to be feared. Some Manhattan Project scientists had wanted to stage demonstrations of the weapon for Japanese generals to convince them to surrender, rather than a live bombing. Hiroshima was selected partly because the damage would be “sufficiently spectacular…when publicity on it is released.” This wasn’t just an act of war, it was a media event. “There stood the Enola Gay, bathed in floodlights like the star of a Hollywood movie,” Colonel Tibbetts recalled about boarding the plane. “For the next 20 minutes we were put through a photo routine to which none of us were accustomed.” As they returned to base, tail gunner Bob Caron snapped a picture of the cloud that sprouted behind them. His would be the only official photographs successfully developed from the mission. He wrote to his mother, asking her to collect press clippings for their scrap book.The view was different from the ground.“Many times I tried to trip the shutter release but the victim would ask for pity,” one Japanese photographer said about touring the aftermath. “It was too cruel, too inhuman to ignore their pleadings.”“If I had known it was an atom bomb, I don’t think I would have ever tried taking pictures.”The strike soon developed into an information war. Initial official reports to the Japanese people were that the US had deployed a new, ‘special bomb’, but the damage was minimal. In Hiroshima, what we would now call ‘fake news’ proliferated among the survivors. Some heard that the city would be uninhabitable for 75 years. There were rumours that Japan had secretly developed its own ‘special’ bombs, and had destroyed Los Angeles among other American cities.American wanted the truth to be known, at least for now. Leaflets were dropped on potential further targets featuring Caron’s snapshot. It noted that “the atomic bomb’s horrendous destructive power can be understood by viewing this photo.” An earlier leaflet dropped on Hiroshima had warned civilians that although the targets were military, “unfortunately, bombs have no eyes.”Seventy-five years later the atomic information war is still raging, but has moved from leaflets to social media. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists warns of a general poisoning of our ‘information ecosphere’, including “sophisticated, technology-propelled propaganda” and leaders throwing doubt on scientists and “national institutions that have historically provided societal stability and cohesion.” The hacking of Twitter in July, in which accounts including American Democratic nominee Joe Biden sent out spam messages, had dark implications. President Trump, apparently not hacked, once tweeted that he had a “much bigger and more powerful” nuclear button than Kim Jong Un.“I don’t think nuclear war could be started by hacking into Twitter,” says Squassoni, “but when you have the leaders of countries issuing nuclear threats on it, that’s a serious development.”Hiroshima’s after-image faded into the culture of the atomic 20th Century, the ultimate symbol of danger and progress. Children could draw the cloud\u0027s silhouette, like Mickey Mouse. It influenced everything from the nuclear-powered rage of Godzilla to the bikini swimsuit, named for nuclear tests on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands.Meanwhile, Hiroshima and its people found themselves transformed into silent symbols. The mushroom cloud. The ruined dome. Kengo Nikawa’s pocket watch, stuck forever at 8.15. And for some, just their shadow, burned into the wall behind them, like a photo negative.9th August 1945. It is a cloudy day in Nagasaki. 40,000 people are blasted into memory. The original target for Fat Man, the second and so far final nuclear bomb used in warfare, was Kokura. It is skipped over due to a thick hanging fog.Meanwhile, Hiroshima is still in the shadow of the first bombing, with many survivors now living in Dr Hachiya’s hospital. A horse, burned and blind, ambles around its garden, eating the leaves of a potato patch the doctor had planted.Eleven days after the blast, more baffling symptoms become evident. People who were relatively unscathed develop speckles on their skin, then die. Another mystery: epilation.“Falling hair! This was an unusual symptom, but undeniable. Unconsciously, I grabbed some of my hair and pulled. I did not have much hair in the first place, but the amount that came out made me feel sick,” wrote Dr Hachiya.No one knows what is happening. They are in the dark.“The idea was to explode the damned thing,” recalled Hymer Friedell, who oversaw biomedical research at the Manhattan Project and later toured Hiroshima. “We weren\u0027t terribly concerned with the radiation”The world experts on the subject were now those who lived through it. Dr Hachiya noted that the closer the survivors were to the centre of the blast, the more likely they were to develop these novel symptoms, placing each patient on a map. The value of this data did not go unnoticed.Navy Secretary James Forrestal told President Truman that survivors would offer “a unique opportunity for the study of the medical and biological effects of radiation which is of utmost importance to the United States.” A legion of international scientists descended on Japan and the survivors. Reports from local doctors were collected and expanded upon. The survivors were to be studied, not necessarily treated. A cure was never an option.Many ‘hibakusha’, as they came to be known, found themselves outcasts. Their stories were censored by the American occupation, while they were shunned by society at large.“Every survivor has had a different experience,” says Takuo Takigawa, director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. “Some people didn’t want to go near them because they were ‘infected’. With others, there was a thought that they would soon die anyway.”Hibakusha were banned from public baths, for fear of contaminating the water. People refused to employ them, and certainly wouldn\u0027t marry one. The spectre of radiation exposure transformed into the idea that they were inherently sullied. Some chose to never have children.“At that time in Japan any physical deformation or injury was heavily shunned,” says Barak Kushner, professor of East Asian history at Cambridge. However, the shame extended even to those without visible injuries. “In some ways they are symbols of Japan’s failure and defeat, and of the poverty to which Japan has sunk, as it’s not able to help them. They don’t get specific compensation until years later.”Meanwhile, studies moved from the immediate aftermath to the long term. By 1950, 130,000 survivors were enrolled in what is known as the ‘Life Span Study’. It precisely surveyed where each survivor was standing relative to the blast, just as Dr Hachiya had done. Surviving hibakusha have reported for check ups right up to today.The study forms the world’s largest bank of knowledge on the effect of radiation on the human body. It is so thorough that in 1982, scientists at the Los Alamos National Lab built a replica of Little Boy – including the uranium – to better understand its findings. It helped develop safe medical uses for radiation, like CAT scans and X-rays. Nasa consulted it to help protect astronauts from cosmic radiation. Now the survey is focussing on the next generation, tracking possible effects on survivors’ children.“The rainy season officially ended yesterday,” Takigawa chuckles. “Today is a very sunny day in Hiroshima.”It is difficult to put a final number on the number killed by the attacks in 1945, given the confusion afterwards and the malignant effects of radiation, but estimates suggest more than 200,000.The rumours that Hiroshima would be uninhabitable for 75 years proved false. Both it and Nagasaki are now thriving. In 1949, a law ordered that Hiroshima be rebuilt as a “Peace Memorial City, a symbol of the ideal of making lasting peace a reality.” Despite fears over radiation, many citizens chose to stay and rebuild the city they loved. Before the war it had a population of around 350,000. Now it’s more than 2 million. The ruin of the industrial museum remains preserved at the centre, the dome cracked and open to the sky.Once forgotten and ignored by the world at large, the hibakusha became figureheads for peace movements worldwide. The Memorial Museum was established at least partly to remind the world that the victims are people, not just symbols.“The hibakusha saw it as a mission of sorts, to tell their story,” says Takigawa. “The reality of what happened, the feelings and memory, must be passed on, so people can feel the horrors of that event themselves.”The threat has not passed, for any of us. Every year since 1947, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, first established by former Manhattan Project workers, set their ‘Doomsday Clock’ to indicate how near we are to annihilation. This year it ticked to 100 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been. They point to the breakdown of arms control treaties a general worsening of relations between the great powers and climate change as contributing factors.“The world is sleepwalking its way through a newly unstable nuclear landscape,” the Bulletin warned. “Any belief that the threat of nuclear war has been vanquished is a mirage.”Moreover, nuclear weapons now have to compete with a wide variety of impending disasters.“They’ve fallen out of the public consciousness, but polling 20 somethings shows they actually believe they will be used in the coming decades. The younger generation is very fatalistic. However, nuclear weapons don\u0027t rise to the top of the agenda for them, whereas climate really does,” says Squassoni.After 75 years, the light from that blast has faded in the public consciousness. Simply put, we are no longer afraid of the atom bomb. Then again, neither were the people of Hiroshima.Few people live in constant fear of the newer threats Seth Baum specialises in, from artificial intelligence to designer viruses that would make coronavirus balk. They’re threats most will never have imagined, right up until the point they happen.“The last time that happened was the September 11 terrorist attack, which was low-tech, but it caught us off guard and changed how we think about the world,” says Baum. “So did coronavirus.”Takigawa says Hiroshima takes pride in teaching the world a lesson about peace, even though it had to suffer terribly for it. “There may be other ways of learning this lesson, but I can’t think of any,” he notes. In 2016, Barack Obama became the first US president to visit the site of the bombing. He gave a touching speech, paying tributes to the hibakusha and noting that “the scientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well.” It’s another admirable lesson, just one of many we’ve learned from Hiroshima and Nagaski: technologically, medically, politically and philosophically.Yet, fundamentally, they’re not lessons the people of Hiroshima needed to learn on 6 August 1945. We can learn from the dead. They can’t learn by dying.

I urge everyone to get a test if you have symptoms, self-isolate and provide your contacts to NHS Test and Trace so we can continue to keep the virus at bay and get back to normal.Researchers carried out initial swab testing of 150,000 people in May, while full lockdown was still in place, and again following the easing of restrictions.Of the 159,199 swab tests carried out in the latest two weeks, just 123 were positive.At any one point in the two weeks between June 19 and July 8, there were 39,000 people with Covid-19, compared to 74,000 in May.The overall reproduction \u0027R\u0027 number was calculated at around 0.58, compared to 0.57 during May.Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College, said: The epidemic has transitioned out of lockdown phase but prevalence has continued to decrease. We estimate a decrease in prevalence from 0.13 per cent to 0.077 per cent. We have to be a little bit careful because the last data were for early July, but we did estimate that the \u0027R\u0027 number was still below one then, so there is a little bit of room at that time for further relaxation of measures within causing the pandemic to return to growth.However, some experts warned that it was too early to say whether later relaxations, such as pubs reopening at the beginning of July, had had a negative impact. Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: This report largely confirms what we already know about the trajectory of the epidemic in England.But it is important to realise that the fact that the early relaxations in June did not cause an increase in cases does not mean that further relaxations will have done so already or will do so in the future.The report, commissioned by the Department of Health, also showed there were no significant differences between the prevalence of infection for key workers and non-key workers, in contrast to the findings from Imperial\u0027s first study.The authors believe improved infection control measures in care homes and hospitals led to fewer workers testing positive. Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups were more likely to test positive than those of white ethnicity, the results showed.The findings also showed that 81 per cent of people testing positive reported no symptoms on the day of the test or the previous week, up from 69 per cent in the previous survey.In separate research released by Public Health England (PHE) and the University of Cambridge experts estimate calculate that the number of infections arising each day across England is likely to be 3,200, and that by the third week of August there will be between 47 and 91 deaths each day.They believe the \u0027R\u0027 number is now likely to be close to one in most regions, with the south-west potentially above one, although the number of infections is very low, making it difficult to be accurate.The probability of \u0027R\u0027 being above one is less than 20 per cent for London and the south-east, and less than five per cent in the east of England.London, followed by the north-west, continues to have the highest attack rate (16 per cent and 10 per cent respectively) – the proportion of the population who have ever been infected. The south-west continues to have the lowest (three per cent).More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh accent among attractive world due bond effect survey","story":"Yesh, it is. The Edinburgh accent has been voted among the most attractive in the world thanks to “The Bond Effect”- courtesy of Sir Sean Connery, a survey has found.Researchers asked 1000 Britons to listen to voice recordings spoken in 20 dialects and rank them on a scale of 1 to 5 based on various positive traits, including attractiveness.Born in Fountainbridge, just west of Edinburgh city centre, Sir Sean, 89, played James Bond in the first five films of the spy series, starting with Dr.No in 1962.His timbre is now recognised across all age groups as one of coolness, helping to cast the Scottish capital\u0027s dialect in a similarly smooth light internationally, according to researchers.Commenting on the findings, Rachael Lloyd, a relationship expert at eharmony, told The Daily : “No doubt, people mentally heard the phrase “Bond, James Bond” in Sean Connery\u0027s famous burr as they responded.“A major reason for this popularity is that he is someone who is familiar to all age groups, who know him as the suave, sophisticated \u0027original\u0027 Bond and as such, link the accent to these qualities. The fact that these universal associations stand the test of time have a really significant impact on how people perceive others with the same accent.”In the study, participants listened to the same 40 voice recordings read by actors in different accents, before ranking the clips for traits such as charm, good humour and intelligence.The sentence read: “In Britain we can expect rain at any time of the year. While winter is wetter than summer, seasonal differences in rainfall are very small.”Received pronunciation was seen as the most attractive accent with an average score of 3.34, due to its association with intelligence, followed by the New Zealand accent on 3.06, and Edinburgh was third at 2.91.In contrast, the Cornish dialect ranked last for attractiveness, with a score of 2.28, although it was rated highly in relation to a good sense of humour.But the distinctive Celtic twang only marginally lost out to Spanish and French, which came 18th and 19th respectively.Researchers said views on accents are largely shaped by perceptions of celebrities speaking with them on TV and in films.The study noted that just under a quarter of people surveyed felt more positively about the Geordie dialect because of Ant and Dec\u0027s likeable on-screen personalities.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils told not hug eachother a level results day even feeling","story":"School pupils are to be told not to hug each other on A-level results day even if they are feeling “emotional” after receiving their marks. Students who come into school on Thursday to pick up their grades in person must remember to uphold social distancing guidelines, headteachers have said.Next week, the majority of teenagers in England will receive A-level grades that have been calculated using a statistical model after the coronavirus crisis interrupted the exam season.Headteachers are concerned that results day will involve large groups of students meeting at school, “many of whom are likely to be emotional and so will find social distancing even more challenging than usual”, according to the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL).But official guidance from the Department for Education (DfE) states that students should minimise contact with their peers as much as possible on results day.Parents should be banned from accompanying their children on to the school’s site, and should be urged not to congregate at the entrance.“Schools should continue to make clear to parents that, should they wish to accompany their child to collect their results, they must not gather at entrance gates or doors and neither should their child, or enter the site unless they have a pre-arranged appointment,” the DfE guidelines say.Schools which decide to minimise contact by staggering the arrival of students on results day should bear in mind that pupils who are allocated later time slots could be at a disadvantage to their peers.This is because students who have missed their offers and are entering the clearing process may want to phone up university admissions offices in an attempt to secure a place. They might have a better chance at success if they are able to start earlier in the day, as would  students whose grades are better than they expected and who want to trade up by finding a place at a more prestigious institution. Most A-level and GCSE results will be decided by statistical modelling rather than teachers\u0027 predicted grades.Concerns over the reliability of teachers\u0027 predictions – in particular their tendency to inflate pupils\u0027 grades – led to a decision by Ofqual, the exam regulator, not to rely wholly on them.A recent analysis by Ofqual found that teachers bumped up predicted A-level marks by 12 per cent on average and GCSE marks by nine per cent.The watchdog said it was not surprising that grades predicted by teachers were optimistic since teachers naturally want to do their best for their students.Ofqual said their researchers tested out 12 different statistical models and chose one which drew on a number of factors, including data on pupils\u0027 previous education attainment as well as previous results of students at the same school.Under the model, the rank order which teachers drew up for this year\u0027s students will also play an important role in determining grades. For new schools, which do not have historic data, as well as small schools or those in which low numbers of students are taking particular subjects, teachers\u0027 predictions will be the primary source of evidence for grades. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has promised that no child will be penalised by this year\u0027s system and that all exam grades will be as fair and valid as those in previous years.But headteachers have warned that this will be a year in which some pupils are bound to feel victims in a process which is not of their own making.Geoff Barton, general secretary of ASCL, said Ofqual have done the best it could but added: This was always going to be a problematic year. There will be people who think the system isn\u0027t fair this year, but the reality is that Covid isn\u0027t fair.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said: “No system could be a perfect substitute for real exams, but I welcome the appeals guidance confirmed by Ofqual today, to make the process as fair as possible and make sure all students get a grade that allows them to progress. “Grades this year will do for the vast majority of students what they do every year, opening the door to their next step whether that’s college, university, an apprenticeship or the world of work. “And students will also have the opportunity to take exams this autumn if they are unhappy with their grades.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"remote racing virtual cheers london marathon 2020 can run anywhere","story":"London Marathon runners will receive medals if they complete the race remotely this year, organisers confirmed as they launched an app that will mimic cheering from spectators. This year\u0027s marathon can be completed anywhere in the world. Its 45,000 registered participants can complete the 26.2 miles over any course of their choice, while elite runners will compete at an event around St James\u0027s Park in the capital.Numbers will still be worn, a specially downloadable app will be created to provide race music and support, and runners from every continent will be given from 00.00am to 23.59pm on Sunday, October 4 to complete the distance.Finishers will still receive a coveted medal and T-shirt, and all entrants will be offered the option of taking part on the normal London course in 2021, 2022 or 2023. Entries for this year will also be reopened later this month by however many people chose not to run virtually, meaning the 45,000 capacity is still reached and charitable fundraising – which topped £66 million in 2019 – is maximised.Hugh Brasher, the race director, called it a day of sadness and certainty but said the changes would provide an unprecedented accessibility to an event that attracted 450,000 entries this year.People can do it in a uniquely personal way, he said. Yes, the experience will be different, but actually we really hope that it will be even more memorable, even more enduring and it will be the most inclusive London Marathon in history.Around 750,000 supporters usually line the London Marathon route and, although Covid-secure plans for runners to socially distance over staggered starts had been created, the sheer number of associated people made holding a mass race impossible.A new technology, using bluetooth and ultra wideband ranging, would have even allowed organisers to monitor every participant\u0027s distance from each other and trace any contacts if there were positive Covid-19 tests over the subsequent two weeks. The biggest challenges were not those involving participants but the multiple issues of managing spectators, ensuring the emergency services had access across London, the increased likelihood of a second spike that has led to the recent cancellation of spectator trials at major events and the ongoing concern about the pressure even a reduced size mass participation marathon might put on the NHS, said Mr Brasher.The elite-only race will be staged without fans on a secure loop around St James’ Park that is just over two kilometres long, meaning the runners will have to complete 19.8 circuits before leaving for the usual finish up The Mall.Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei, the respective men\u0027s and women\u0027s world record holders, have been confirmed for the elite races as well as David Weir, who has won the wheelchair race eight times.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"twitter facebook have crossed rubicon unfairly censoring donald","story":"If you wanted to find an example of Donald Trump saying something inaccurate or misleading, you would not have to look far through the archives of his speeches, interviews and tweets. If you wanted to pick out a great big porky uttered by anyone on Facebook or Twitter, you wouldn’t have to try too hard, either.But how odd of Facebook and Twitter to make such a meal out of a remark made by the President about Covid-19 in an interview with Fox News earlier this week: “If you look at children, children are almost – and I would almost say definitely – but almost immune from this disease.” Facebook has removed the interview from its site while Twitter suspended Trump’s campaign page. According to Facebook it is “harmful Covid misinformation”.Strictly, Trump is wrong to say that children are virtually immune from the infection. According to randomised tests by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) between 26 April and 27 June, 0.29 per cent of 2 to 11-year-olds and 0.31 per cent of 12 to 19-year-olds were carrying the virus – not a lot less than the 0.42 per cent of 20 to 49-year-olds who were doing so, and more than the 0.23 per cent of over 70s. Children’s immune systems aren’t simply batting away the virus.Yet children do seem to have a very high level of protection against suffering serious ill effects from the virus – which is presumably what Trump meant. Among 15,230 Covid deaths in New York to 13 May, for example, just nine occurred among under 18-year-olds, six of whom had underlying health conditions. In the context of the discussion he was having – arguing that there was no reason why children should not return to school – it wasn’t an unreasonable point to make, even if his language was a little careless.It is hard to escape the conclusion that Twitter was especially keen to make an example of Trump, to try to convince us that it is taking a strong stance against hate speech and fake news, when in reality the site remains as big a sewer as ever. Inevitably, action against the president is going to gain more publicity than action against an anonymous user with a few thousand followers. Perhaps Twitter is frightened of advertising boycotts and hopes that taking a stand against Trump will appease the activists who spend their lives campaigning against nasty big corporations.I suspect that will be a vain hope. Even if temporarily appeased, woke activists will soon be back for more they always are. But there is an even bigger danger for Twitter and Facebook. Their intervention against Trump’s interview blows apart any pretence they have to be mere platforms – as opposed to publishers of content.If Twitter and Facebook stopped at removing illegal material, they might still reasonably claim the status as platforms. But they have gone further than that, and forced the removal of material which is perfectly legal but with which they disagree. They have, in effect, edited Trump’s contributions – which is what publishers do. Now that they have crossed the Rubicon, they can have no complaint if governments start treating them as publishers – for both legal and taxation purposes. They should spare us their moaning if, say, they are made to answer for libels committed by their users, or they are forced to account to a regulator for the accuracy of every statement carried on their sites.How would Facebook and Twitter cope with the sheer volume of complaints? They may wish they had remained champions of free speech, detached from the content carried on their platforms, and left Trump to spout off all he likes.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/20/16/solar-energy-.jpg","title":"brightest material ever fluorescent light","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Applications include realistic 3D displays and harvesting invisible light for solar powerA major breakthrough with fluorescents has allowed scientists to create the “brightest known materials in existence”.The advance paves the way for a new class of materials that transform fluorescent dyes into solid objects, according to researchers from Indiana University in the US and the University of Copenhagen.There are more than 100,000 fluorescent dyes in existence but until now it was not possible to mix them in a predictable way in order to produce solid optical materials.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers formulated the new class of materials, called small-molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES), using positively charged fluorescent dyes to create a solid material.Applications for the material range from solar energy harvesting to next-generation OLED displays.Solar energy breakthrough creates electricity from invisible light“These materials have potential applications in any technology that needs bright fluorescence or calls for designing optical properties, including solar energy harvesting, bioimaging, and lasers,” said Amar Flood, a chemist at Indiana University and co-author of the study.“Beyond these, there are interesting applications that include upconverting light to capture more of the solar spectrum in solar cells, light-switchable materials used for information storage and photochromic glass, and circularly polarised luminescence that may be used in 3D display technology.”Fluorescents have the unique property of absorbing light of a certain colour and emitting a light of a different colour and wavelength. For example, fluorescent materials are able to absorb ultraviolet (UV) light – which is invisible to humans – and emit light on the visible spectrum, making it appear as though the material is glowing.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Like young children sitting at story time, they interfere with each other and stop behaving as iniduals.To overcome this, Professor Flood and his team mixed the dye with a colourless solution to prevent the fluorescent molecules from interacting. The researchers were then able to grow crystals from the SMILES that formed as the material solidified.A research paper detailing the discovery was published in the scientific journal Chem on Thursday.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Simon Smith, who leads a primary school in Yorkshire, said test and trace was a “key element” in keeping schools safe. “Parents need to feel all the systems are there,” he told The Independent, ”and that if something does happen, things will happen very, very quickly in terms of the actions that schools will take”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Track and trace is a key part of that,” the headteacher at East Whitby Primary Academy said.His comments come after a study has suggested the government must scale-up its test and trace system - which tells people if they have been contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus and to isolate for two weeks – to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections as schools fully reopen. What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyOne of the authors, Chris Bonell, professor of public health sociology at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said the current testing system has “about 50 per cent coverage”.A government minister said the plan for English schools to welcome all students back next month is “not up for debate” on Tuesday following the study’s publication. Speaking about test and trace, Mr Smith from East Whitby Primary Academy said: “As a headteacher, I feel very little confidence at the moment around the fact we would be informed, or everybody is being informed that should be informed.“It may be people are wandering around with the virus without knowing.”Pepe Di’Iasio, a headteacher near Rotherham, said a scaled-up test and trace system would help his school feel better prepared for the September return. “I think we would all feel better if we had confidence in the system and obviously with four weeks to go,” Mr Di’Iasio, who is also vice president elect of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), told The Independent. “We would rather have that confidence as quickly as possible.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers from University College London and LSHTM simulated various scenarios to examine the possible implications of schools reopening in the UK coupled with broader reopening of society, such as more parents returning to the workplace and increased socialising within the community.The authors of the modelling study – published in The Lancet Child And Adolescent Health - found that “with increased levels of testing... and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.“Reopening schools fully in September, alongside reopening workplaces in society, without an effective test, trace, isolating (TTI) strategy could result in a second wave of infections between two and 2.3 times the size of the original wave,” Mr Bonell from LSHTM said.“Currently, TTI is not achieving the levels that we modelled. Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage,” he added.The NAHT, a school leaders’ union, said the new research showed “just how many factors there are to preventing a worsening Covid-19 outbreak, most of which are entirely outside a school’s control”.Efficient test-trace-isolate system needed to reopen schools- studyMinisters still planning to open all English schools in SeptemberMPs criticise school meal voucher scheme for covering M\u0026ampS but not LidlPaul Whiteman, the general secretary, said: “The success of September’s return to school rests as much on what happens outside the school gates as within.”He added: “The government needs to ensure that everyone knows what actions they should be taking to keep everyone safe – we’re all going to need to work together to be successful.”Meanwhile, Richard Bettsworth from ASCL said: “It is very clear that an effective test, trace, and isolate strategy is vital in suppressing the rate of infection, and keeping schools open.” The director of public affairs added: “The government has to make sure that this works at the scale that is necessary.”Schools are expected to fully reopen to all students in September.  A government spokesperson said: “We have rapidly built, from scratch, the largest diagnostic testing industry in British history. Over 16 million tests have been delivered so far and we have the capacity to carry out more than 330,000 tests per day, growing to 500,000 per day by the end of October.“Plans have been put in place to ensure schools can re-open safely. Local health officials, using the latest data, will able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases.They added: “The NHS Test and Trace service has now and contacted more than 218,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, or recently been in contact with someone who has tested positive – in order to break the chain of transmission.”Additional reporting by Press Associationtest and trace\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In 2018, she disclosed that she was set to earn more than $20m a year under a new agreement.“I’m 48 now, so I’ve finally gotten to the place where I’m OK asking for what I deserve, which is something that comes only with age,” she told The Hollywood Reporter at the time.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All together the intention there is just to keep you playing instead of doing other things that may not be necessary in the game.”Fifa 21 is going to other lengths to reduce wasted time while playing multiplayer games, including the removed of the “walk back” animation that sees players return to the centre circle, and the time given to take set pieces has been scaled back from 30 seconds to 10, 12, 15 and 20, for kick-offs, throw-ins, goal kicks and free kicks, respectively.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only 56 per cent of close contacts handled online or by call centres were reached and told to self-isolate for 10 days.In comparison, local health protection teams have been more successful, reaching 98 per cent of close contacts of people who tested positive.In recent weeks local health officials have criticised the national centralised service for failing to reach enough close contacts, including in areas hit the worst by the virus such as parts of the north west of England.There is now a push to recruit more people to local health protection teams and local councils have been given increased access to patient level data in order to carry out their own local test and trace service.More than three quarters of people who were tested at a regional testing site for Covid-19 received their result within 24 hours, but overall 97 per cent of results were communicated the next day if not within 24 hours.Since the launch of test and trace, 199,524 close contacts of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 have been reached through the tracing system and asked to self-isolate.This is 82.2 per cent of a total of 242,749 people identified as close contacts.Scientists on the government’s Sage committee have said the service must reach 80 per cent in order to be useful in curtailing the spread of the virus.The remaining 43,225 people were identified as close contacts, but were not reached.Baroness Dido Harding, executive chair of NHS Test and Trace, said: “Test and Trace is working. It has already helped to prevent almost a quarter of a million people unknowingly spreading the virus. But we do not work alone. Close partnerships with local government and local public health teams are essential to stop the spread of the virus, and NHS Test and Trace continues to work hand-in-hand to support communities experiencing spikes in cases, through increased testing and additional contact tracing.“Winter may seem far away but it’s what we do right now that counts. So please do play your part to stop the virus from flaring up again – this system will only work if you come forward for a test and help us to trace your contacts. So if you have symptoms, however mild, get a free test immediately. If you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace, follow the advice you receive.

How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

More than 2,500 people are known to have made the unauthorised crossing so far in 2020, compared with fewer than 500 in 2018.One inidual who is scheduled to be on the flight, a Yemeni national who said he fled his country last summer after being jailed and threatened by the Houthi regime, told The Independent he felt suicidal after being detained last Friday and issued removal directions.The 24-year-old, who didn’t want to be named, arrived in the UK on 27 May after crossing in a small boat from Calais. He then claimed asylum and was subsequently placed in a hotel in Birmingham which is being used to house asylum seekers during the lockdown.He spent two months in the hotel, during which he said he felt “safe” and “human” again. On 30 July, he was placed into asylum dispersal accommodation in Coventry, but early the following morning the house was raided by immigration enforcement officers and he was taken to Brook House removal centre.“I felt so scared. Everything I’ve worked so hard to reach is being demolished. I’m destroyed. I’m unable to eat or drink. I feel that there’s no meaning to my life,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe Yemeni national said he wanted to claim asylum in the UK because he felt he would adapt better here than in other European countries, as he already knew members of the Yemeni community in Britain and wouldn’t face the “harshness” he faced while travelling through France and Spain.“In Spain, I was first housed by a charity for a few days, but then they kicked me out because they were closing, and I had to sleep on the streets. In France, I slept in a bus station and face a lot of difficulty from street gangs, who stole my food,” he said.“Coming to the UK was a new opportunity to live again. I was feeling safe. I felt human again. Now I’m scared. I’d rather go back and be killed in Yemen than die on the streets in France. I have the right to claim asylum in the UK. My country is in a war.”Lily Parrott, trainee solicitor at Duncan Lewis, the law firm representing the man, said it was “deeply concerning” that the Home Office was resuming removals to France, noting there had been a recent spike in cases of Covid-19 in the country, in particular Marseille, where the flight is set to land.“These asylum seekers risk facing destitution and homelessness. Further, we have not been assured that the people being removed are being done so lawfully or that the Home Office has checked whether they are at high risk from Covid-19,” she said.Celia Clarke, director of Bail for Immigration Detainees, speculated that the move may be part of a strategy to “rush through” as many removals as possible under Dublin regulations, because the practice will likely cease to be part of UK law after the Brexit date. “This utterly reckless step risks spreading coronavirus across borders. As so often happens, immigration enforcement is being prioritised over public health,” she added.Labour MP Diane Abbott said it was “unbelievable”, adding: “All of these asylum seekers will be particularly vulnerable to Covid, because of their ethnicity and other medical reasons, and we know France has seen a rise in Covid cases. The Home Office is potentially sending people to their death, but does not seem to care.“Bella Sankey, director of charity Detention Action, said the decision to charter the flight was “wrong in principle and will be dangerous in practice”. Windrush says Priti PatelShe continued: “How can the Home Office guarantee that those they are seeking to deport have had adequate access to legal advice and have not been exposed to Covid either in detention or in crowded asylum accommodation? “Instead of playing politics with public health, the Home Office could take this opportunity to redeem its Windrush-damaged reputation and show a human face.”The Home Office has been approached for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Saturday will likely be another hot day for southern and central parts of the UK, with heatwave conditions possibly being met in parts of southeast England and East Anglia,” he added.The hottest day of the year so far was 31 July, with the highest temperature recorded at 37.8C in Heathrow. The Coastguard reported its busiest day for more than four years as it dealt with over 300 incidents and has warned people planning to visit a beach or the coast to “follow beach safety advice”.How to sleep during a heatwave, according to expertsPeople are being warned not to be caught out by soaring temperatures, with the UK expected to be hotter than some of Europe\u0027s top holiday destinations, including Ibiza and Tenerife.Grahame Madge, a Met Office spokesman, said: Everyone needs to be careful during this heatwave, especially on Friday, where we are going to see a dramatic rise in temperature in some parts, exceeding the heatwave threshold.After a slightly cooler week, people should make sure they aren\u0027t caught out.

However, when large numbers of people head to the coast and tourist spots there is inevitably a risk of overcrowding and an increase in the rate at which Covid-19 could be transmitted.“Lives depend on all of us taking personal responsibility for our actions to avoid a resurgence of this deadly virus that puts further lives at risk.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The explosion that killed at least 145 and left hundreds of thousands homeless could not have happened without a huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate. It could not have happened without that explosive material being confiscated from, or possibly abandoned by, the Rhosus, a Russian-owned cargo ship. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd it could not have happened without the negligence of Lebanese authorities in allowing the dangerous cargo to sit in deteriorating conditions in the docks for six years.The figure of Igor Grechushkin features prominently in the first two links of that hapless chain. A rough-and-tumble businessman from Khabarovsk in the far east of Russia, Grechushkin was on Thursday confirmed as the Rhosus’s owner by Russian state media.He had made contact with the Russian consulate in Nicosia, diplomatic sources said. Greek media have reported he is being sought by Cypriot police for questioning. Beirut in mourning as families desperately search for loved ones A seized ship and the Russian connection to Beirut blastLebanon declares state of emergency over Beirut explosion – updatesGrechushkin controlled the Rhosus from a company registered in the Marshall Islands. But he conducted his business from Cyprus, a traditional, low-tax base for all kinds of Russian business. We already know much about the Rhosus’s fateful last journey. Contracted to transport 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate from Batumi in Georgia to an explosive factory in Mozambique, the ship was abandoned after failing a safety inspection on a stop in Beirut in December 2013. The vessel, and part of the crew, were held in port as authorities worked out what to do. The crew was only released 11 months later, in September 2014 – the same time the dangerous cargo was unloaded to a warehouse in the docks. In interviews with Russian media on Tuesday night, the captain of the vessel described how Grechushkin stopped paying the bills and left the Russian-Ukrainian crew to their fate. “If we weren’t brought food by a certain Beiruti guy, we would have died,” Boris Prokoshev told the Mediazona publication. Neither Grechushkin nor the intended recipients took any subsequent interest in the ship’s dangerous cargo, the captain added. He wrote to President Putin to express his concern, but was ignored by the Kremlin too.  No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe experienced sailor says he was initially encouraged by the prospect of working for Grechushkin, a fellow Russian. But he later realised his boss may not have enjoyed the soundest financial footing. Problems with cash were evident on a stopover in Greece, when the owner ordered necessary supplies for the ship, and then refused to pay for them. There were also problems with crews walking out. It would only be later that the captain realised they had not been paid for four months. Now is the time for action – not just kind words – to help BeirutCapt Prokoshev says he gave up on an attempt to sue the absent owner for lost income after a Russian court advised him to pursue the claim in Cyprus. By the time the crew were freed by a Lebanese court in September 2014, the sailor said Mr Grechushkin owed him $60,000 (£46,000) in unpaid wages, his senior mechanic $50,000, third mechanic $20,000 and navigator $10,000. Mikhail Voytenko, the editor of Maritime Bulletin who presciently referred to the Rhosus’s cargo as “a floating bomb” six years ago, suggests no aspect of the story was particularly unusual. Ammonium nitrate was a common enough cargo, he tells The Independent, used the world over for fertilisers and mining explosives, and this is likely what it was destined for in Mozambique. “Chancer businessmen” at the start of shipping careers often take on “risky jobs” without proper finance to back them up, he suggests. Meanwhile, port authorities around the world are guilty of negligence, corruption or both. It was the confluence of all three factors together, Voytenko says, that made the events of Tuesday possible. In the search for fall guys, the media had arguably focused too much on Grechushkin, who had been “deprived of his assets and had no obvious legal or factual obligation”. The most important of the three factors was the negligence and corruption of Lebanese authorities, he suggests.“Whatever in the world made the port authorities keep the cargo for six years is beyond my comprehension,” he says. “It seems likely that authorities couldn’t decide among themselves just how to split up the profits.” Voytenko says the sell-on value of the ammonium nitrate would be worth upwards of $1m.According to Capt Prokoshev, that figure corresponds to the amount Igor Grechushkin took for payment for the shipment in Batumi. “Grechushkin simply decided to dump the ship and pocket the million,” the captain said in an interview with Radio Svoboda, without offering paper evidence of his claims. The Independent was unable to reach Grechushkin to confirm this or other aspects of the story. Capt Prokoshev meanwhile said he was too ill with high blood pressure to offer any additional comment.

appealing against a conviction for the  rape of a -year-old woman, also at Praia da Luz.The paedo is a suspect in a string of unsolved crimes, reportedly including an alleged attack on a -year-old British girl in the resort in , one of a series of incidents where young girls were targeted.German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the investigation into him, previously told the PA

place.“We found a bin bag and inside were wigs and exotic clothing, whether just fancy dress or something stranger I couldnt tell.”She revealed she was later contacted by Scotland Yard who quizzed her about her former neighbour.Madeleine McCanns disappearance from the holiday resort of Praia da Luz  years ago sparked one of the biggest missing person hunts in modern history.Praia da Luz, known simply as Luz, is a parish located around four miles from Lagos in the Algarve, Portugal.The community had a population of just , when a census was last carried out in .Once a small fishing village, its been dubbed #little Britain# for the concentration of Brits who take holidays there.Julia Meyer, a spokeswoman for the prosecutors office in Braunschweig, told The Sun today that there is still #no comment# in regards to last weeks dig of an allotment in Hanover.She added: #We currently have no plans to issue a statement about the search.#We are currently not commenting on the ongoing investigation.#Kate McCann made a “horror” discovery while combing through police files on her daughter’s discovery.The heartbroken mum revealed in her book how the family’s routine with friends they were holidaying with could have been easily monitored by anyone watching them.A friend of the family had made a block booking at a tapas restaurant close to their apartment so they could check on their young children intermittently.She wrote: “It wasn’t until a year later, when I was combing through the Portuguese police files that I discovered that the note requesting our block booking was written in a staff message book, which sat on a desk at the pool reception for most of the day.“This book was by definition accessible to all staff and, albeit unintentionally, probably to guests and visitors, too.“To my horror, I saw that, no doubt in all innocence and simply to explain why she was bending the rules a bit, the receptionist had added the reason for our request.“[It was because] we wanted to eat close to our apartment as we were leaving our young children alone there and checking on them intermittently.”Madeleine McCann was three when she disappeared while on holiday with her family in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May  .German investigators have alleged that Christian B, , killed her soon after abducting her from a holiday apartment in the resort.That’s despite British police continuing to treat her vanishing as a missing persons probe.He is in jail in Germany for drug dealing, and is appealing against a conviction for the  rape of a -year-old woman, also at Praia da Luz.German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the investigation into him, previously told the PA news agency that prosecutors have “concrete evidence”, but not “forensic evidence” that Madeleine was killed by the suspect.He said they may “know more” than Scotland Yard, who are still treating the case as a missing person investigation.In her book Madeleine: Our Daughters Disappearance and the Continuing Search for Her, Kate McCann details how their ground-floor apartment was a “prime” spot for criminals.She wrote: “Though I envied David and Fiona with their sea view, being on the ground floor meant we didn’t have to worry about the children’s safety on a balcony.”Kate continues: “Later, we were told by the British police that the ground-floor location, access to roads front and side, secluded entrance and partial tree cover made our apartment a prime target for burglars and criminals.“Never once did this occur to us when we arrived.”Christian B kept kids’ clothes and swimwear in his mobile home, it has emerged.Convicted paedophile Christian B, , bought the red and white Allegro Bay RV in early  — three years after moving back to his native Germany from Portugal.Pals said he used it to drive regularly back and forth between Germany, Spain and Portugal and once boasted how he could allegedly “carry children and drugs” inside.Cops found the clothes and swimwear after seizing the RV as part of their probe into missing Inga Gehricke, who disappeared in  during a picnic with her parents.Christian B used a derelict crate factory at Neuwegers­leben as a weekend pad where he kept the RV.The items were found there in  along with USB sticks containing images of child sex abuse.Other images on the sticks included some of Christian B partially naked or wearing stockings performing a solo sex act.The six data sticks and two memory cards were found buried under the body of his dog at the factory, wrapped in a carrier bag.Our journalists strive for

Junior idols are singers and models who are marketed as stars from a very young age in Japan, which can even include pre-teen children. Although some see it as a way of building an audience before adulthood, the junior idol subculture has been criticised for sexualising young girls for an audience overwhelmingly made up of middle-aged men. And in a country where possession of child sex abuse images wasnt made illegal until , many think the practice is dangerous. Now a new Marcel Theroux documentary, Unreported World: Schoolgirl Pin-Ups, delves into the creepy culture by following one junior idols quest for stardom. I think it’s dangerous, one junior idols tells Theroux when askedother fans in the culture are sexually attracted to children.Of course, not everyone has this feeling. But when I talk to them, many are dangerous.”The Channel  documentary covers the le of Yune – who was scouted into the seedy junior idol business when she was just six years old. Now , shes constantly working to grow her audience in Japan, which boasts the second biggest music industry on Earth. “I’ve always dreamed of standing on stage at the Budokan, Yune tells Theroux, referring to the ,-seater Tokyo stadium thats hosted the likes of The Beatles and Taylor Swt. To help her realise Yunes pop star dream, her mum takes her to junior idol gigs and helps her with her weekly broadcasts on a live streaming app called Showroom. “I think for Yune, people come for her singing voice,” Yunes mum tells Theroux. But she also recognises theres a darker side to the junior idol business, keeping her address a secret and carefully moderating all the comments on Yunes livestreams before her daughter sees them.In one broadcast, which is watched by over  fans, Yune sings: Give me, give me your love, kiss me baby, won’t you pamper me sometimes At the end of the broadcast, in which adult fans can send her cash presents, one -year-old man tells her shes very beautul.Despite the questionable comments, Yunes mum isnt worried. We have to think of a balance, she tells Theroux. One doesn’t have to see what one doesn’t have to see.But when you’re trying to achieve something, there will always be obstacles.” Even seedier than the livestreams are the live shows, in which  menflock into a concert hall to see a showcase of the girls in the flesh. After the £ performance, fans can then queue up to meet the children afterwards, paying another £ for a CD or signed Polaroid.But many fans just want to have their photo taken with the junior idols themselves – one even asks Yune to handcuff herself to him in a picture. This kind of culture is kind of a little bit growing and blooming in Japan, but still, most of the Japanese think it’s not a good culture, one fan tells Theroux. We enjoy her performance in a gentleman’s way, so no pressure, no harassment, but we support her play and her growing up.” The -year-old who told Yune she was beautul on the livestream even pays extra to do his own private photo shoots of her after shows. The superfan, called Koji, slavishly attends Yunes gigs, even travelling to Taiwan and the Philippines to watch her. “I do find it really weird, Theroux says. There’s something strange about seeing these middle-aged men who are basically starstruck by these -year-old girls.” Even Yunes own manager understands what hes exposing the little girl to. I can’t judgethe audience is watching in a sexual way, Mr Karimata tells Theroux.All I can do is protect hersomeone in the room tries to touch her.”The disturbing sexual element of her followers is also something the men who follow her recognise. Normal people think we are creepy, Koji says. Wherever I go, people think the same way.”But when pressedjunior idols fans are sexually attracted to children, Koji confirms the grim reality. “To be honest there were fans of Yune like that. I think it’s dangerous, he says. Of course, not everyone has this feeling. But when I talk to them, many are dangerous.”Some people who have studied the junior idol phenomenon think part of the obsession stems from Japans epidemic of loneliness. Over million adults under the age of  in the country - which has a population of .million - arent in a relationship, leading to a whole service industry catering to satisfying the needs of lonely men.One notorious example are the maid cafes, in which blokes pay to be served drinks by young girls dressed as french maids. “For people who come [to maid cafes] their actual le and families seem , like a fake world, says Prof Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who has studied loneliness in Japan. When they come here, they feel more like themselves.Prof Yamada estimates that a quarter of all Japanese people under  wont ever get married, and they turn to alternative virtual love to fill the gap. People are looking for a fantasy family, such as a sister, mother or lover, he says. In the case of idols, it’s a daughter. Satisfying people who want a fantasy family has become a business.”But despite loneliness being a factor in the spread of the junior idol subculture, Theroux remains wary of its risks. “If I’m right, the junior idol industry is playing with fire, gratying desires that would be criminalacted upon, he says. As Yune treads her dficult path towards stardom, I just hope that those around her will continue to keep her safe.Unreported World: Schoolgirl Pin-Ups is on Channel  on Friday, th August, at .pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A spokesman for the Local Government Association, which represents  councils in England told The : “Many people do not answer the phone to any unrecognised numbers. All of us at one time have been pestered by cold callers. For some hard-to-reach people, answering the phone can bring problems being chased for a debt or faced with language dficulties.“We would encourage anyone called by the    number to answer and do their bit to help defeat this virus.But it is also crucial that missed calls can be followed up on the ground by public health experts experienced in contact tracing. The LGA said local authorities were best placed to deal with outbreaks because of their understanding of an area. They said: “Covid- is best understood as a pattern of local outbreaks, rather than a national pandemic with a similar impact in every community, which is why councils as local leaders have a fundamental role to play in the test and trace service.“Councils’ public health teams need to be able to use their unique expertise, including speaking other languages, and understanding of their communities to try to reach those who cannot be contacted by the test and trace system.In Blackburn with Darwen, the local council has launched its own test and trace program to contact potentially infectious residents using local knowledge after failures in the national system. Health officials in Greater Manchester are also looking into setting up their own team of virus tracers to combat the rising tide of cases in the north.Boris Johnson said the test and trace system was absolutely crucial for the Governments coronavirus strategy.If you look at what we are doing with some of the local social distancing measures that we are bringing back in, thats entirely driven by our ability to detect cases through local test and trace, working with our local authorities and taking the right local measures, he said.That is how we hope that we will be able to keep the lid on the disease.Earlier this week, a major study found the UK was facing a second wave of coronavirus by December and the test  trace system was only finding  per cent of contacts of cases. The number falls far below the target of  per cent that Government scientists said needs to be hit. The boss of outsourcing giant Serco has defended the number of people being contacted and asked to isolate as part of the Test and Trace system, saying it is improving all the time.Rupert Soames, CEO of Serco, one of the providers running the test  trace call centres, defended the system claiming it had been blown out of proportion. He told BBC Radio : I think we need to get this into proportion. Youre giving me the numbers saying that were tracing % of contacts, let me tell you that % of the people that we talk to agree to self-isolate.So weve got a very, very high success rate of people that we get to contact.He blamed people being unable to recall who they had met on the failure to reach contacts of cases. He said: If somebody rang you now and I said tell me everybody that you have met, been in contact with, in the last  hours and tell me on the telephone, give me their contact details, how many do you think that youd be able to reel off of the top of your head And the fact is that about % of the contacts that people give us, say I know I sat next so somebody on a bus on the way in but I dont have their contact details. Im sorry, but my brother-in-law brought around a friend last night, I dont have their contact details. So there is an element of that and it is about % at the moment where people cant remember or never knew the contact... the details of where they were.The failed contact tracing app trialled by the Government on the Isle of Wight will be re-launched to help tell people about their infection levels in their area. A version of the app is being developed to help people use their personal information to calculate a risk score, according to The Times. The app was initially hoped to help the contact tracing effort but it failed to be accurate enough to use, and instead the Government backed Google  Apples efforts to develop a contact tracing app. Shadow health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said local authorities needed to be put in the driving seat for the system to be effective. He told BBC Radio : “The problem with the national system, where you effectively get a call from a  number from a call centre run by an outsource company like Serco, is that they are not as effective as the on the ground authority.  “When you look at the statistics, the [local authority] has a much better success rate. That’s because after  hoursSerco can’t get hold of people - which is around  per cent - they pass the contacts over to local public health officials, and they have a success rate of around  per cent. So they are clearly better at getting hold of people.”  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Children were also distanced from their biological parents to be raised by all the adults - while boys and young men were sexually abused by leaders.And in a sinister creed issued by the church, which was set up by former Baptist Noel Stanton in , Elders were instructed to “Beat Adam [sin] out of a child by the age of seven.”The sect - which followed a strict set of rules banning toys, sugar, sweets, TV and all the trappings of a normal childhood - was shut down last May. And now, a leaked report, seen by the BBC, has found that its senior members covered up decades of abuse of women and children.All of the sects five surviving leaders effectively colluded with sex offenders through their handling of complaints, according to the report, which follows an inquiry commissioned by the church in .The leaders must take responsibility for their inaction, said independent investigator, Vicki Lawson-Brown, who also found a culture of “blaming victims” and of disgraced leaders being reinstated.Its a culture that mum-of-three Anna* grew up in.As a young girl in the Jesus Army, regular beatings dished out by the Elders of the commune were part of Annas le from the moment she could walk.Her mum was the single mother of a nine-year-old girl when she fell pregnant for a second time in her twenties. Facing family pressure to have an abortion, she was attracted to the Jesus Army’s non-judgemental message of love – and they welcomed her with open arms.After the birth, Anna, her older sister and her mum moved in to Sheepfold Grange, a sprawling manor house in the Northampton countryside owned by the Church and shared by around  members.At its peak in the early s, the now-dissolved Jesus Army – also known as the Jesus Fellowship Church – had more than , members living in communes in Northamptonshire and around the country.Boys and girls in the sect were forced to be separated, while women wore long skirts and hair because showing ankles and ear was sinful.The statement added: The Trustees repeat our sincere apology, as we have before, to those who have been harmed as a consequence of actions or inactions by those in the Church. The JFCT Trustees acknowledge the trauma of victims and those who have had a negative experience of the Church. JFCT continues to work with victims to help bring closure and compensation through establishing a redress scheme, and through other means.At Sheepfold Grange, Anna and her sister were separated from their mother and “parented” by so-called Brothers and Sisters deemed appropriate by the Elders.“My big sister remembers them beating me at two, Anna tells Sun Online.“They made you choose your own knobbly stick off the bush and I picked a whip-like branch with loads of knots on it, which wasnt a good choice.“That stick hurt so much I climbed on top of the wardrobe where it was kept, and broke the knobbles off  - but I got a beating for that too.“I remember thinking it was goodit just burned,it just felt hot. But the beatings that felt like a cut, like real pain were the worst.”After school and working in the field, the children attended nightly meetings – known as agape– where members prayed, chanted and spoke in tongues.“When I was four, I was sitting in agape wearing a onesie and it was really itchy. One Brother who hated me from a very small age, said, ‘Stop scratching. Thats the devil,she says.“I was desperately trying not to scratch but I was wiggling around so I got beaten.“My mum was constantly told I was possessed by the devil. One of the Brothers would put his hand on top of my head, keeping me at armsand speaking in tongues.I remember desperately trying to wiggle and escape, but I couldnt because he was just pushing on my head.Worldly possessions – including toys, books and radios – were banned, as was all music other than hymns.Children were forbidden to play with school friends, go on school trips or celebrate birthdays and Christmas. And at lunch, they were forced to come home to eat.Snacks, including bananas, were prohibited and only meals from Goodness Foods, the central food store run by the Jesus Army, was allowed.“We weren’t starved,” says Anna. “There would be three meals a day, usually meat, boiled potatoes and vegetables, but it was absolutely vile and you had to eat every bit.”A sexist hierarchy meant that men were considered elite and the women and children worked on the farmland, cooked and cleaned.According to Ms Lawson-Brown, who authored the new leaked report, women were historically regarded as subservient to men and treated as domestic servants, putting them and kids at greater risk of abuse.And Anna claims: “Mum was bottom of the pile because she was a single mother and was seen as a sinner.“I don’t remember seeing Mum much but when I did she looked downtrodden and sad.”Even as a small child, Anna was sent out to London and Birmingham aboard the Jesus Army bus, to evangelize and recruit new members, particularly the homeless.“I remember playing in their cardboard boxes, she says. “They were so accepting and nice, unlike the people I lived with.“We would pick up homeless people, mentally ill people and they’d get in the van and come home with us.“There was no vetting because only God can judge – eventhey were a paedophile.”We revealed last year how homeless and vulnerable men were used as slave labour by the Church, while girls and boys were at the mercy of their superiors and sexually assaulted by adults and other children.Five men have been convicted over the sexual assault of  boys, between the s and s, and police are investigating over  complaints of dferent types of abuse.Solicitor David Greenwood, who is dealing with ongoing cases, said the cult was a totalitarian regime laid down by Noel Stanton which deprived children of their childhood.And in her new review, Ms Lawson-Brown described a signicant case where the surviving leaders, by their failure to act, protected a convicted paedophile allowed to continue in his role as an Elder by Mr Stanton.Anna – who, when she spoke to us last year, had only recently started therapy – says she doesn’t remembershe was sexually abused.She has never spoken to her sister about her experiences, although she remembers her shaking and crying” in bed.Her older sister left when she was  but it was a couple of years later - when Anna was eight - before her mum found the courage to follow.Anna had argued with an Elder at the meal table and was about to get another beating when her mum pulled her away.“It was the first time in my le Id called out to my mum and she’d saved me. We left the next day, she says.After escaping the strict environment of the commune to live with her gran in Northampton, Anna says she went wild and spent her early teens years doing drugs and petty crime, before falling pregnant at .Now settled with three children, Anna says she has friends who have been destroyed by their time in the Jesus Army. But she says she was saved by the birth of her oldest daughter.Another sect survivor, Adam McLeod, was  and homeless when he joined the community after meeting an Elder at a party.Having lost his job, and been thrown out by his mum, he was sofa surfing and was invited to New Creation Farm, where Stanton lived.“The culture was to hug everyone, to show them how much you love them,” he says. “No ones judging you and it just felt amazing.“That drew me in and they took advantage of my vulnerability.”Noel took to Adam immediately, inviting him to move into the farm.Although the founder died in , before the abuse allegations surfaced, some survivors have claimed he was involved in the sexual abuse of young men and other leaders have since been prosecuted.Karl Skinner was given a suspended prison sentence in recent years for inappropriate behaviour with a young boy, and Alan Carter was sentenced to three years in prison for sex acts on a boy aged between  and  in the s.And Adam says the culture of “love” soon turned into something more sinister.“The hugs began to cross lines and there was a lot of inappropriate touching,” he says. “I was young and good looking and I had so many advances from the leaders, even in the prayer meetings.“One guy always came in for a hug and then his hands would wander.“It was a dficult situation. I didnt get confrontational and say ‘Dont touch me.’ I would go along with it and then avoid them.“I didnt tell anyone at the time, because I was very confused.As so many boys were living at the farm, Adam was made to share a single bed every night. He also recalls ritual humiliation, including making him strip naked in front of them when he needed new clothes.On joining the commune, members surrendered all their worldly goods and handed full financial control over to the church.But, in the three years he was there, Adam claims the group financially abused him, using him as slave labour and not paying his debts.“They promise to take away your financial burdens, which was a dream for me as I had debts,” he says.“But I got into a mess because they never kept their promise. I had a car on finance which ended up being repossessed because they never made a payment. The same went for other financial bills.”Adam was made to work full-time in two businesses for no pay.“Because you have no money, you dont have any freedom,” he says. “They controlled everything.“You eat what youre given. I got a lt to and from work every day and they’d bring in my lunch. I was so hungry that I would sneak down to the stockroom and steal energy bars.“Because you are not earning, youre not able to save any money to escape.“I took pride in my appearance and they stripped that away. I was wearing disgusting hand-me-downs and haircuts were done in-house and were hideous.Desperate and unhappy, Adam got back in touch with his mum who finally came to take him home in the middle of the night.Now a property manager, the -year-old says his experience has left permanent damage.“I find it hard to trust people,” he says. “It ruined my confidence.”Another survivor, Maria*, recalls spending Christmas doing back-breaking work on the farm as a -year-old, pulling potatoes from frozen ground from dawn until after dark.She was also sent away from her parents to live at another site, New Creation Farm, when she was  after a nurse of  took a “special interest” in her.“She showered me with letters and cards and regularly telephoned me,” she says.“When I went to stay at the farm, in a cottage that just had women living in it, I was informed thatI went to the toilet I had to leave the door open, andI had a bath I had to let others come into the bathroom.“I found this humiliating but was powerless to protest or do anything about it - I was just a child and no one would listen.“They never sexually abused me but I was sexually exposed and I’m certain that was for the sexual gratication of some.”The church’s financial abuse has had long-term repercussions for one couple – Ian and Jeannie Johnson.Ian joined the church in  after Stanton asked him to help him establish their food business, Goodness Foods.But, after marrying fellow church member Jeannie, who ran the church’s baking business,  he became increasingly disillusioned over financial irregularities.The couple left in , after having children, but more than  years on Jeannie is still paying the price.In  the Jesus Fellowship initiated a disclosure exercise, encouraging anyone who had experienced abuse - or any other negative experience - to bring this to the attention of the church safeguarding office. Information from this process was provided to the Police, who launched an investigation.As a result five offenders were subsequently convicted of non-recent child sexual offences connected to the church.

His comments come after Britain came in last place for workers who have gone back to work in major European cities with just over a third of staff back behind deaths.The Government formally scrapped work-from-home advice and begged people to get back to the office on Monday. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick this morning urged people to get out and help support local businesses to stem the tide of growing job losses. When askedhe was concerned about London being emptied out as people continue to work from home, he said: I am very concerned about London and city centre more generally.

More green shoots of hope came as the Bank of England today revised its gloomy outlook for Britains financial recovery, saying it wont be as dire as initially thought.

Motorists must also give way to pedestrians and to cyclists when joining and leaving the roundabout.Reduced lane widths on the roundabout and at exit and entry points are designed to encourage drivers to slow down.Boris Johnson is said to be keen on creating a mini-Holland, and has pledged to build thousands of miles of protected cycleways, Forbes reports.During Prime Ministers Questions on May , the PM also said that the near future should be a golden age for cycling. It comes after locals expressed fears to Cambridgeshire County Council about the old roundabout-located near the citys Addenbrookes Hospital- which was perceived by many people to be dangerous to cycle around. People also reported feeling unsafe when walking in the area due to a lack of pedestrian crossings, particularly more vulnerable users, the authority said.But concerns have been raised over the cost of building the new roundabout, which was originally estimated at around £, but had almost trebled to £. million by the end of the project. A council highways report cited additional utility work including BT and UK Power Networks cabling, as well as the Covid- pandemic, as reasons for this.And some furious locals have said the new system is confusing - with one even branding it a killing zone on Twitter.Reacting to the roundabout, Alice Hodkinson said: Really Bad. This is a cyclist killing zone, like radegund road Perne Road.While Paul Howell added: Cant wait for everyoneto get confused and the accidents to start happening. How about spending the money on road schemes that need it.And local Tony Stark said: Putting pedestrian crossings on these in Cambridge is loading the bullet into a gun. I hope when the accidents start building up, the city council will be willing to pay out as ultimately it will be their fault.The road networks in Cambridge are out dated and can not deal with the current and ever increasing flow. Better road networks should be a priority not further slowing it down and prioritising pedestrian and cycle ways.She added: I feel very safe with this layout, the geometry made it easy to see the cars leaving and approaching the roundabout and the people driving were all giving way to the people cycling and walking.The RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes also backed the decision, saying: Going Dutch will take on a whole new meaning in Cambridge and the council should take credit for trying to improve safety for all road users.For drivers, this may well be an unusual junction to navigate in the first instance, but they should remember that priority must be given to both cyclists and pedestrians as well as the usual give way to vehicles approaching from the right.Some might have concerns about the impact on congestion but ultimately,the scheme reduces collisions and injuries then that will be the true measure of success.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a list of questions that authorities in Beirut wanted Grechushkin to answer.The police chief said the questions were about clarications and explanations concerning the vessel and its cargo.The killer cargo of , tons of ammonium nitrate was confiscated in  from the Moldovan-flagged ship Rhosus while en route from Batumi in the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia to MozambiqueLebanese authorities reportedly deemed the ship not seaworthy and impounded the -year-old vessel and its crew of ten sailors.The crew protested that Grechushkin claimed he had gone bankrupt and had abandoned the ship - going on hunger strike before finally being allowed to go ashore.Grechushkin was said to have paid a “huge penalty” for transporting the cargo which led to him going bust - later moving to Cyprus with his we Irina.He lives there with his we and youngest son Miron in Limassol, a city with an estimated , expats from Russia.Neither the businessman nor his family have yet commented on the explosion, which had one fth the power of a nuclear bomb.The Russian captain of the ship Boris Prokoshev, now , warned at the time of the deadly nature of the cargo.He said: “The vessel’s owner abandoned it and we were abandoned too. We were living on a powder keg for ten months without being paid.The ammonium nitrate was sold by Georgian fertiliser maker Rustavi Azot LLC, and was to be delivered to a Mozambique explosives maker, Fabrica de Explosivos.It was however impounded by Lebanese authorities, and sat on the dockside in Warehouse  for six years until it blew up on Tuesday.Anger is mounting as Lebanons government and customs officials point fingers at each other as to who is the blame for the monstrous explosion.Hang up the nooses trended across Lebanese social media in an indication of the fury that followed the initial shock and grief.Reportedly the blast was sparked when a reckless welder caused a fire at nearby Warehouse  - which then spread to the explosive Warehouse .President Michel Aoun said the government was determined to investigate and expose what happened as soon as possible, to hold the responsible and the negligent accountable.Sources close to the investigation blamed the incident on inaction and negligence, saying nothing was done by committees and judges involved in removing the explosives.The cabinet ordered port officials involved in storing or guarding the material since  to be put under house arrest.Public Works Minister Michel Najjar told Al Jazeera he had only found out about the presence of the explosive material stashed at the port  days before the explosion.No minister knows whats in the hangars or containers, and its not my job to know, he said.Badri Daher, Director General of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI that customs had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger.He said: We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why.Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned thatit was not moved it would blow up all of Beirut.Two documents revealed that Lebanese Customs had asked the judiciary in  and  to ask the concerned maritime agency to re-export or approve the sale of the ammonium nitrate.One of the documents cited similar requests in  and  - suggesting repeated warnings about the danger were overlooked by the authorities.It is a white crystalline solid and is highly soluble in water - with the chemical formula NH₄NO₃.The chemical is applied in granule form into the soil and quickly dissolves under moisture, allowing nitrogen to be released.Another use of ammonium nitrate is in the food industry where it is used as a nutrient in producing antibiotics and yeast.In most countries, it is used to make explosives for mining, quarrying and civil construction because of its low cost and ready availability.It has been the cause of numerous industrial explosions over the last three decades, including the explosion at a chemical plant in Toulouse, France, in  that killed  people.Ammonium nitrate was also used to create the explosives used in the  Mumbai train bombings.By itself, ammonium nitrate is not regarded as dangerous but under certain conditions, it can become deadly.The chemical is classied as an “energetic material” meaning that it produces heat as it decomposes.If there is a signicant amount of ammonium nitrate it can generate enough heat to catch fire and continue to burn eventually causing an explosion. Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed those responsible will pay the price as rescue operations continue in Beirut.International aid is being mobilised across the world to help support the victims and search for those potentially still trapped beneath the rubble.The US, UK, France, Gulf states and even rivals Israel have offered money and assistance, as President Aoun declared three days of mourning and announced he would release £m of emergency funds.HMS Enterprise will carry out survey work in the port to establish the extent of the damage.British engineering experts have found the blast was unquestionably one of the largest non-nuclear explosions ever to take place.The team from the University of Sheffield has calculated the strength of the blast based on the videos and photographs of the catastrophe.They believe the explosion was the equivalent of , to , tonnes of TNT.There are concerns of food shortages and unrest in the city, with the blast compounding anger stemming from a severe economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t believe Caroline was treated as anyone  would have been.“The initial decision to caution her would have been accepted by Caroline and she would have been alive today.“Why would the CPS and police feel the need to make statements that were not correct “I believe it was because they know that the reason this was ­pursued in the way it was had everything to do with who Caroline was and not what she had done. They wanted a show trial.“As the coroner made clear: celebrities should not be treated better because of their status but ‘they shouldn’t get any worse treatment than anyone ’.“The family feel very strongly that Caroline had dferent treatment than she would have had she not been a celebrity.“Caroline you were loved. I love you. Those that would have harmed you can’t touch you now.”She also accused prosecutors of misleading the coroner by insisting no reports of Caroline’s deteriorating mental health were made to them after the initial court appearance in December.Her statement said: “They said that the ‘last communication’ from Caroline’s legal team that ‘specically referred to her mental health’ was Dr Garabette’s report made in December. This is not true.“In January, an abuse application was made by Caroline’s lawyers which specically set out further concerns for her mental health and the pressure she was under.“It referenced her self-harming and was the basis upon which it was said that the prosecution was not a proportionate response.”And she challenged prosecutors’ assertion that Mr Burton had not withdrawn allegations he made in the  call. She also questioned the seriousness of his head injury.She said: “As for the CPS, their view changed from there being nothing serious about this incident to describing the injury sustained by Lewis as ‘serious’.“As the pictures of that injury shows it was minor, so why did the CPS feel it necessary to justy their actions by claiming the injury was more than it was.“The coroner said she was struggling to see how the injury could be described as serious. The coroner also felt the CPS approach did not appear impartial and there seemed to be a desire to punish Caroline.”The inquest at Poplar coroner’s court heard Caroline was found naked and covered in blood with a deep, self-inflicted cut to her wrist when police arrived at her flat after the alleged attack on tennis player Mr Burton.She told officers: “I hit him. He was cheating on me.”But Det Insp Lauren Bateman told the inquest Caroline had not made it clear in her police interview what she was admitting to.The lack of a full admission meant the case could not be dealt with through a caution, she said.However, a report read at the inquest from prosecutor Alison Wright said police had pushed to bring a charge of assault after accusing her of being biased because of Caroline’s celebrity.After hearing more evidence from the CPS, mum Christine told prosecutor Lisa Ramsarran: “After listening to you and the first lady , I feel even more that you had it in for Caroline. I now know how Caroline felt and it is not very nice.“Thank you, coroner, for allowing us to ask questions today. It’s meant a lot.”Caroline’s fragile state was also laid bare at the inquest, which had heard from her twin Jody that she had made several previous attempts to overdose.She said one was before the first court appearance and then a further two times, including the day before she was found dead at her flat in Stoke Newington.A letter to Caroline’s GP from the psychiatric department of the hospital where she was treated after the alleged assault on Mr Burton was also read to court.It described how she was “tearful and anxious” and that she “said she had too much to drink”.It added: ‘The reason for the argument was she saw messages on his phone, texting another girl.“She said it was an impulsive reaction .”Caroline had told police in a statement: “I admit I did it. I used the phone. I had his phone in one hand and my phone in the other.“I whacked him round the head. There’s no excuse for it. I was upset.”Her mother Christine told the hearing Caroline insisted she hit him with her mobile phone and he had a small cut to his head.When the TV presenter’s phone was seized, it had blood on it and a crack on one of the corners, the inquest heard. But prosecutors had insisted he was hit with a lamp.Prosecutor Lisa Ramsarran told the inquest she was satisfied the injury was “at the top end of what you might see”. But coroner Mary Hassell said: “I’m really struggling to understand how this injury was regarded as signicant.”She also left a note, revealing her insecurities about the case.The handwritten message was found by a paramedic lying on top of an open magazine on a coffee table near her body.It read: “Please let this court case be dropped and myself and Lewis find harmony.”Jody, who was watching the inquest on video link alongside her mum, was asked to confirmthe handwriting was her sister’s.She said in a statement read in court: “It looks exactly like Caroline’s writing.”Det Sgt Jonathan Maharaj said there was evidence of “a number of calls” made and received on ­Caroline’s mobile phone, which was retrieved from her flat.Her web history showed she conducted searches for “people who blame” as well as for information about suicide.Recording a verdict that Caroline had taken her own le after the two-day hearing, coroner Mary Hassell said: “She acted in a way to take her le. There’s no doubt in my mind whatsoever about that.“There’s a last question when a verdict of suicide is ed that a family will ask. And that is why  How could you not have that question  Why did she do that “To me it seems all the evidence points in the same direction which is that Caroline had fluctuating mental ill health.“She had struggles in the past and, in spite of the fact she may have led to some what might have been a charmed le, actually the more famous she got the more some of these dficulties increased because she had to cope with the media in a way most of us don’t.“And when things went wrong for her — and I’m thinking here obviously of the events in December — she didn’t have any privacy.“She faced the prospect of not working in the job that she loved, of losing a great deal and, although her general fluctuating state was a background and was obviously very important in her death, I find the reason for her taking her le was that she now knew she was going to be prosecuted for certain.“She knew that she would face the media, the Press, the publicity, it would all come down on her.”Christine responded: “I totally agree and you have it spot on.“Anyone who has followed this inquest will get their own conclusions. We know you’re not allowed to say certain things and it’s up to uswe want to take it any further.“We’re not going to but we think exactly as you think.

Wide-ranging new proposals aim to cut red tape to speed up housebuilding in England, making it easier for developers to build on brownfield sites and handing more power to local authorities. But critics said the new blueprint would kill off affordable housing and reduce the influence of local communities. The Royal Institute of British Architects said there was every chance they could also lead to the creation of the next generation of slum housing and described the proposals as shameful. RIBA President Alan Jones said: While thereaposs no doubt the planning system needs reform, these shameful proposals do almost nothing to guarantee the delivery of affordable, well-designed and sustainable homes.  While they might help to aposget Britain buildingapos - paired with the extension of permitted development - thereaposs every chance they could also lead to the creation of the next generation of slum housing. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer raised concerns about the decision to scrap a requirement for developers to build affordable homes and other community infrastructure amid a shortage of affordable housing.He said: This is a developersapos charter frankly taking councils and communities out of it. And on affordable housing, which is the critical issue, it says nothing. In fact it removes the initiatives that were there for affordable housing. But Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick hit back at the claims, saying it was complete nonsense that the new proposals would create low quality homes and insisted local people would be able to make a meaningful contribution.However he admitted that unpopular projects could not be halted once an area was designated for growth under the reforms. In a round of broadcast interviews, he said the criticism was complete nonsense, adding: I saw those comments and they were put out before weaposd even published the document. Mr Jenrick has insisted we will cut red tape, but not standards, saying it currently takes seven years to agree local housing plans and five years to get building. He added: These once-in-a-generation reforms will lay the foundations for a brighter future, providing more homes for young people and creating better quality neighbourhoods and homes across the country. It also aims to boost the share of houses built by small and medium-sized building firms, which built % of new homes  years ago but only % today.  The new White Paper ides land into three categories – earmarked for growth, renewal and protection. Areas designated for renewal will have permission in principle, making it quicker for approval to be granted. Land designated for growth will be available for new homes, hospitals and schools, while protection will cover areas of natural beauty and green belt land.Mr Johnson and his influential aide Dominic Cummings are enthusiastic about overhauling the planning process.During a visit to a housing development in Warrington, Mr Johnson said: What weaposre doing is simplying the process so you actually get much more affordable housing. This solution gives thema much simpler infrastructure levy that enables them to go ahead and build a much bigger chunk of affordable housing and help people onto the property ladder.

Dave and Clare Edwards put in an official complaint to the Independent Office for Police Conduct on Wednesday about Durham Police’s inquiry into their allegations. The couple claim they are “% certain” they saw Boris Johnson’s chief aide while out walking in Houghall Woods near Durham the morning of Sunday April . A third new witness also claims they saw Mr Cummings in the local beauty spot that morning, adding: “I would recognise him again.” Mr Cummings has described as “” allegations that he made a second trip to the North East, after the Mirror andrevealed his first trip. They are among four witnesses who have told a joint investigation they believe they saw Mr Cummings back in County Durham on the morning of April  - and the first to go public. The Tory adviser drove  miles with his we, who had symptoms, and son to self-isolate at his parents’ home on March  at the height of the lockdown. During their two-week stay the family took a day-trip to Barnard Castle,  miles away, on April , which he later claimed was to test his eye-sight. But in an extraordinary press conference in the No  garden, the top aide denied claims by a member of the public that he was in Durham on April , saying he had photos and data on his phone to prove it. A No  spokesman said on Thursday: “Durham Constabulary have made clear they are not taking any further action against Mr Cummings and that by locating himself at his father’s premises he did not breach the regulations. “The Prime Minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and he considers the matter closed.”  The latest revelation puts pressure on Mr Cummings to produce the evidence that he said on May  proves he was in London, and not Durham, on April . It also raises further questions about the Prime Minister’s decision to back him after it was revealed he broke the Government’s own rules, prompting public outcry and damaging confidence in lockdown restrictions. The coronavirus crisis has left a trail of devastation, resulting in more than , deaths so far and warnings of thousands of job losses as the lockdown takes its toll on the economy.  Clare Edwards, a nurse practitioner, and her Conservative-voting husband Dave, who works in manufacturing, reported their alleged sighting to Durham Police in May. It came after an initial witness, who first got in touch with the Mirror on April , claimed that both he and his we had spotted the PM’s top aide while walking in Houghall Woods that morning. The man, who did not want to be named, said Mr Cummings, who was with a female companion, commented as he passed by: “Aren’t the bluebells lovely ”  Since then another new witness, who also wishes to remain anonymous, claims they saw the No  aide and his we walking between the local beauty spot and the family home the same morning. Another inidual subsequently told thethey believe they saw Mr Cummings on Hampstead Heath in North London later that day. Mirror reporters drove the route one quiet Sunday morning after lockdown was over and it took three hours and  minutes, driving in line with the speed limit. Mr Cummings denies he was in Durham on April  and Durham Constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation. They concluded he may have committed a “minor breach” of the regulations when he drove to Barnard Castle on April  - also his we’s birthday - but no further action would be taken. The couple then put in a so-called Subject Access Request to establish how the force had handled their personal information - which they hoped might reveal how their complaint was followed up. The details, heavily redacted and marked ‘official-sensitive’, eventually arrived last week but the couple, both , felt they showed their claims had not been taken seriously. They have now written to the IOPC, which oversees the police complaints system in England, asking them to look into the force’s handling of their allegation.   They wrote: “Given the high profile nature of this issue it is inconceivable that this matter has not been followed up thoroughly. “We have no personal issue with Mr Cummings or his family, but we do feel that Durham Police’s handling of our complaint is below the standard we would expect from our local constabulary. “We ask that the IOPC investigate whether Durham Police acted thoroughly in their investigation of this matter.” His we called on the PM’s senior aide to release his evidence: “It would be great to seehe could produce anything. I just want the truth to be out there.” A Durham Constabulary spokesman said: “As outlined in our statement of May , Durham Constabulary carried out an investigation into this matter led by a senior detective and found insufficient evidence to support the allegation”. The couple told the Mirror they had been “shocked and surprised” to see the man they believed to be Mr Cummings among a group of five adults and a child by the side of the path.  Mr Edwards, who works for a local company which supplied goods to Nightingale Hospitals, said: “He was the dead image of Dominic Cummings. He was standing over a small child on a bike. “As I got through the clearing I said to my we, ‘Did you see Dominic Cummings there ’ If it wasn’t him he would win the Dominic Cummings look-a-like award. “He was identical to the TV footage – dark beanie hat, dark-rimmed glasses. If it was mistaken identity, the police could have ruled that out.” Mrs Edwards, a nurse and care home worker for  years, said she told her husband: “‘Oh no it can’t be’. And I looked at him and there was this man who looked just like Dominic Cummings. “He had a beanie hat, was wearing glasses, he was tall and angular. I was so convinced. But I thought no it can’t possibly be him, he’s in London and we’re in lockdown.” The mother-of-three claims: “I am % certain it was Dominic Cummings. The way he looked – I just know it was him”.  Her husband said: “I’m not politically motivated, I have nothing against Cummings. But we think what we saw was important given the circumstances of the lockdown.” The date stuck in their heads because it was the day after their son’s birthday which they celebrated with a ‘Zoom party’ and quiz because of lockdown restrictions. They also had a time-stamped geo-located photograph, seen by the Mirror, that Mrs Edwards took of the woods moments before they claimed they saw the group. But it was not until the couple heard the PM dismiss reports of a second trip to Durham as “palpably ” at a No  press conference on May  that they decided to contact police. Shortly afterwards the fourth witness claimed they had also seen Mr Cummings and a woman the same morning walking between Houghall Woods and the family home. They made a digital record of the location of the sighting which they shared with friends at the time.  They told the Mirror: “I do follow politics so I know what people look like.” Askedthey were sure it was Mr Cummings, they added: “We know his parents do live locally so we have recognised them before in the local area. I would recognise him again.” “At first I could not quite believe that I had seen him. I thought ‘why would he be up here ’ But I posted about it on the day. I was sure about it at the time”. In the Downing Street Garden, Mr Cummings told reporters: “There is a particular report that I ed there on the  April. Photos and data on my phone prove this to be . “And local CCTV,it exists, would also prove that I’m telling the truth that I was in London on that day. I was not in Durham.”  The top aide refused to apologise for his two-week visit to the North East saying he and his we thought they might need childcare for their four-year-old son in case they both fell ill. Mr Cummings suggested witnesses who claimed they had seen him in Houghall Woods were mistaken and said he had walked in woodland during his earlier self-isolation but on his parents’ land. He said he ed to London on  April but did not clary whether his we or his child were with him. “We ed to London on the evening of Monday  April, Easter Monday,” he said. Mr Cummings added: “I believe that in all circumstances I behaved reasonably and legally, balancing the safety of my family and the extreme situation in No  and the public interest in effective Government to which I could contribute.” Later that week, Mr Johnson was challenged by MPs on the powerful Commons liaison committee over whether he had seen the evidence but claimed “a lot of the allegations turned out to be ”. After avoiding the question three times, he eventually admitted that he had, but refused to pass the evidence on to the Cabinet Secretary to investigate, adding that it was “time to move on”.

The pop star and Britain’s Got Talent judge, , has urged the Government to build on our ban on fur farming by blocking imports. She said: “The fur trade is a cruel and ugly business, subjecting animals to fear and pain for frivolous fashion. “The UK was right to ban fur farming but as long we keep selling fur from animals overseas, we are still paying for their suffering. I urge the Government to listen to the FurFreeBritain campaign and ban fur sales.” She joins stars and conservationists including Ricky Gervais, Dame Judy Dench and Chris Packham in backing our call with the Humane Society International. Last month, we revealed horric conditions on an Asian fur farm as investigators saw beatings and animals being skinned alive. Footie pundit Gary Lineker, , took to social media to express his disgust, saying: “Absolutely horrendous.” Singer Moby, , added: “Fur represents the ultimate in animal cruelty and as long as fur continues to be sold in the UK, the cruelty will continue. Let’s have a FurFreeBritain.” Queen guitarist Brian May, , said: “This is unsupportable in today’s age. We have to stop importation and trade in fur.  “Some people are buying what they think is fake fur but it is actually real because it is cheaper to treat the animals so badly.” Singer Leona Lewis, , said she supported a ban “because cruelty to animals needs to end”. And Dragons’ Den judge Deborah Meaden, , said: “British consumers really care about animal welfare, so switching to cruelty-free ­practices isn’t just good for animals, it’s good business. In a compassionate world, there’s no future in caging animals for fashion.”  More than  million animals are killed every year for their fur, including minks, foxes, raccoon dogs, chinchillas and rabbits. They typically spend their lives in metre-square battery cages. Fur farming was banned in England and Wales in  and in Scotland and Northern Ireland in . Since then, pelts worth £million have been imported – many from China, the US, France, Italy and Poland.  In , almost £m of animal fur was imported, £.m from China alone. Some % of Brits disapprove of the killing of animals in what many brand a “cruel and outdated” industry. And a huge majority of us, %, have never worn or no longer wear fur, a YouGov poll found. Claire Bass, executive director of Humane Society International UK, said: “The UK was the first to ban fur farming on ethical grounds two decades ago.

Proud parents Connie Yates and Chris Gard immediately fell in love with their miracle baby following a successful caesarean birth on Wednesday. The not-yet-named Baby Gard was born weighing lb oz, with his parents gushing over the uncanny resemblance to his big brother, who died in .The world feels a whole lot more beautul this morning, Mr Gard told the Daily Mail. We’ve had about an hour’s sleep between us, but we just can’t stop looking at him. Connie was amazing, as always. He looks so similar to Charlie at the same age – it’s quite uncanny, he continued. It’s scary looking back at photos of Charlie and looking at our new baby... spitting image. The pair tearfully gave up their legal battle to keep -month-old Charlie alive in July , with his condition having deteriorated too far. At the time, the devastated parents said their first born might have been able to live normally despite a rare syndromehe had received experimental US treatment earlier but too much time had been wasted. Charlie had a rare genetic condition causing progressive muscle weakness and brain damage and his parents had sought to send him to the United States to undergo therapy, in a campaign backed by US President  Donald Trump  and Pope Francis.His little brother had a one in four chance of being born with the same illness as his brother - however, tests prior to his birth showed he is free of the syndrome.Earlier this week, Miss Yates, a care worker from Bedfont, south-west London, said sheaposs terried of giving birth a second time. She said her partner speaks to the baby bump all the time, with the postman, , admitting he is worried about feelings of guilt. It may sound silly but I can’t help worry about what will happen when his brother comes along – will I feel guilty to imagine Charlie looking down on us, being a happy family, so in love with his little sibling  he said.

Figures from the Covid Symptom Study app estimate that , people currently have symptomatic Covid in the UK. These figures also highlight that the North currently has higher prevalence rates than the regions in the South. Last week, for the first time, the data science team at ZOE and King’s College London created a aposCovid Symptom Study Watch List,apos which show where the highest estimates of symptomatic Covid in the past week are. The new analysis found that the majority of regions on the watch list are in the North of England. Blackburn with Darwen topped the list, where .% of the population have coronavirus symptoms as of July , which is a rise from the previous week. The number of symptomatic cases in the population is based on the daily new cases and symptoms being logged in the app, whereas incidence rates are simply the number of daily new cases based on the results from swab tests. Blackburn with Darwen was placed into a local lockdown recently following a spike in coronavirus cases. The Covid- infection rate was . cases per , in the week ending July , down from . the week before. Residents in the area cannot meet in dferent households, or people from other households inside pubs and restaurants, as of Friday, July . Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at Kingaposs College London, said the latest data shows the symptoms get worse in the cold weather. “This week, the app also revealed that Covid symptoms and outcomes get worse in colder, less humid weather, which makes it even more important that we get this virus under control as we only have a month or two of warm weather left. Our data suggests that levels have bottomed out at around  cases per day which is too many, so we all need to be conscious of the dangers and to continue to practice high levels of personal hygiene, wear a face mask, social distance and know all the signs of early disease.”  Wrexham was second on the list with .% of the areaaposs population experiencing symptoms. All the reported coronavirus deaths in Wales for the last week have been in one hospital in Wrexham. WalesOnline reports Wrexham Maelor has been the centre of the virus in Wales with one doctor working there apparently describing it as re with Covid. For the seven days, between July  until August , the  deaths were reported in Wales were all at the hospital. Last week, Walesapos First Minister said there was no evidence to support enforcing a local lockdown in Wrexham.  “If the evidence were there that re-openingplaces in those communities would put people at risk then we would take a dferent course of action, but we will rely on the scientic evidence.“It’s why we’ve carried out the mass testing. I think nearly  people will have been tested in those two communities. Data from the symptom app also shows there are currently , daily new cases of Covid in the UK on average over the two weeks up to  July  . Similar to last week, the data suggests that the number of daily new cases in the UK have remained flat since last week. However, the data is beginning to show signs of a North South ide forming again. Mr Spector added: We are now starting to see the figures in the North creep up week on week.  The numbers are still very small so we can’t say with % certainty that Covid is increasing signicantly but it does make us focus on those areas. To understandthese increases are signicant or not, we need as many people as possible in these areas to be logging in the app. "},{"url":null,"title":"first ever female captain birdseye","story":"NewsFirst ever female Captain Birdseye explains how to feed whole family for £We say aye, aye to new Captain Birds Eye, Charlotte Carter-Dunn, who has been kind enough to to provide two easy to follow recipes from leftovers plus five top five tips to save on food wasteShareByTricia PhillipsRuki SayidConsumer Editor:,  AUG NewsBirds Eyes historic new skipper \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

That way I can quickly check what I’ve got in before heading to the supermarkets. “This allows you to see exactly what needs using up first and what you need to buy, so it results in a shop that you’ll actually need. “In my freezer I always have an add- on drawer which is packed with frozen veg and fruit. “Knowing this is full and ready to use allows me to be prepared throughout the whole week. And it means that I can create nutritious meals for my family. “I freeze any leftovers from meals and at the end of the month I make ‘fits’ for dinner –it’s there, eat it!  “This means saving money, reducing food waste and making more room in my freezer for the next shop. “My freezer has been even more of a godsend during lockdown as it’s enabled us to reduce our  shopping trips. “I hope that sharing my frozen hacks will help other families get the most out of their freezer.” Here are two easy to follow recipes from leftovers plus five tips from the winning captain.

They blend well and create a soft smooth texture. Dip frozen bananas in the smoothie mixtures and refreeze for a midweek dessert.  Always have frozen veg mixes in the freezer as they’re ideal for a quick soup and can bulk up stir fries, curries and pies.  If you buy a large cake for a celebration, don’t let it go to waste. Slice the remaining piece into portions, cover in cling film or pop into a box then freeze them. Get them out of the freezer in the morning and they’ll be defrosted by lunchtime.

Kira Charlton, , a young mum and law student from Epsom, Surrey, has had to get up at dawn to study law before her baby son wakes up. ­“Lockdown has been really hard,” she says. “I wake up at am and get two hours of studying done before he wakes at am and then I’ll go back to it when he is having his lunch.” After studying hard for A-levels, Joao Costa, , from Tonbridge, Kent, found himself lost, and struggling with his mental health. “As a young person it felt like our whole lives got sucked away from us in the space of one day,” he says. “My mental health took a hit, it was a spiral down. Everything changed overnight.” Student Sharon Adebola, , from London, had to deal with a broken laptop when learning online was the only option. Sofie Mawdsley-Smith, , from Preston, Lancs, lost her job in a cafe and despairs of finding another. Londoner Athian Akec, , worries about dferences in support private and state schools have offered students.  As the economy melts down and planned futures melt away, there’s one generation that stand to lose most from the pandemic. Yet Generation Z are the young people we have heard from least and have the least say in the future of the country. Now, young people are calling for an inquiry into how Covid has impacted those aged -, and for a national youth task force to tackle issues they face on the road ahead. “This generation is going to pay a very high cost,” says Athian, who lives with his mum, a nursery school assistant, and his younger sister. “A generation will be lost. There is already so much inequality and the crisis is only making it worse.  Young people aren’t getting a fair chance. We are at a ­crossroads in history.”A new ‘Forgotten ­Generation’ study from charity My Le My Say and marketers Opinium reveals that three-quartersof  to -year-olds in the UK believe the coronavirus pandemic has had the biggest impact on them in their letime.Two-thirdsare worried about their future prospects, % are worried about losing their jobs, and % of renters are worried about paying rent. Yet only three in believe the Government thinks about them at all. The charity HOPE not Hate also fears Generation Z will pay the future price of the coronavirus.  “In the first stages of adulthood, many are feeling that the pandemic has stolen their future,” another new report says, warning of a coming storm of youth disaffectionissues are not tackled. “You don’t want to burden other people,” Joao says. “But from having so much to do, this focus on exams and education, suddenly I had nothing. A-levels had been my le for two years. “One of the key elements in depression is that feeling of not having a purpose and that was me. Where you usually have friends around, you were facing it alone, it was a lonely time.  There has been this deeper, darker side to quarantine that wasn’t thought about by Government. I didn’t know where to turn.” Young people are less likely to die from Covid-, but many have been adversely impacted by the pandemic, in part due to a “huge intergenerational living conditions ide”, according to a study by the Resolution Foundation. It adds that millions of children and young people also experienced ­lockdown in overcrowded homes with no garden. Young people’s jobs in ­hospitality were among the first to go too. They have seen the biggest pay swings, along with the oldest workers.  They face mass unemployment, and may ­suffer “pay ­scarring” in future. Tragedies and world events – from the Second World War to Vietnam to   – shape every coming-of-age generation. Aimee, Kira, Sofie, Sharon, Athian and Joao are trying hard to play the cards history has dealt them. Athian’s mental health is back on track, Aimee and Kira have somehow managed their studies and responsibilities. Sofie keeps applying for jobs. As Sharon says: “Where the Government hasn’t done enough, other people, people in their own communities, have stepped in to fill the gap.” "},{"url":null,"title":"heatwave uk brits packed beaches","story":"NewsHeatwave UK: Brits flock to packed beaches ahead of C heatwave on Furnace FridayAround , visitors are expected at Brighton, with , in Bournemouth, , in Great Yarmouth and , in Blackpool as temperatures reach C on Furnace FridayShareByNeil Murphy:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsBrighton Beach is already filling up with hundreds of visitors ahead of a heatwave \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Tomorrow is being dubbed aposFurnace Fridayapos with weather experts predicting it will be the hottest day of the year. Temperatures have skyrocketed to C across Europe thanks to a  mile-wide plume from the Saharan desert. Met Office forecasters say heatwave is expected to last through the weekend, with C possible on Saturday and C on Sunday. This would mean parts of Britain could pass the threshold for an official heatwave, which requires three days of temperatures over C . Pictures show how countryaposs beaches across Britain are are already filling up with eager sun-worshippers. Beachgoers flocked to Camber Sands and Brighton Beach in East Sussex as they soaked up the balmy conditions. Around , visitors are expected at Brighton tomorrow, with , in Bournemouth, , in Great Yarmouth and , in Blackpool. Last week on July , the UK recorded the hottest day of the year and the third warmest on record, with the mercury rising to .Cat Heathrow Airport. London and the South East are expected to see the highest temperatures on Friday, but northern areas such as Manchester and Leeds will also hit the low s. Aidan McGivern, also a forecaster for the Met Office, added: “If everything comes together, thereaposs a possibility we will see C or C. C is most likely. “Truly exceptional heat will arrive during Friday as southerly winds waft our way. “Thereaposs a cooling trend over the weekend, with a thundery breakdown in the middle of next week.” “Itaposs deja phew. Sweltering heat is on the way,” said ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending. The Met Office says that the warmer weather, starting on Thursday, could reach a blistering Cin some areas and is expected to last until Sunday.A spokesman for the Met Office said there was a low chance that last weekaposs record temperature would be beaten again but that large parts of the country would see four or even five consecutive days of incredibly warm temperatures. It is the result of southerly winds moving from Europe and parts of northern Africa, which will push the temperatures up, he said. He added: Itaposs pretty unusual to get two successive events like this within a week of each other with such high temperatures.  The heatwave conditions are expected to last until Sunday before cold air moves in overnight, but conditions are expected to stay hot and humid next week with chances of thundery showers. The RNLI has urged families heading to the beach this week to be aware of potential dangers as the UK braces itself for a potential heatwave.

Visitors to the resort are being asked to blow them while they are out walking in the surrounding countryside or enjoying a bike ride or a jog in the area. The aim is to alert others that they are coming and give everyone a chance to keep apart. Chris Jeffery, park director at Cofton Holidays in Devon, said he came up with the idea after seeing a family of ducks while he was out walking recently. And he ordered  boxes of whistles for holidaymakers the next day. Mr Jeffery said: “Not only do the whistles offer an added sense of security but they’re also an awful lot of fun! “I piloted the whistles with my children before rolling them out – my youngest son, Teddy, initially thought it was another one of dad’s silly ideas. “But, in the end, both Teddy and older brother Harry had a great time running around ‘quacking’ in the woods. “Cases of coronavirus are relatively low in Devon compared to much of the country but we know it’s always a risk, so we’re keen to make social distancing as fun as it can be for families.”Other measures at the site, near Exeter, include additional hand washing facilities, reduced contact at check-in, personal protective equipment for staff and new signage and floor stickers to encourage social distancing.

The Duchess of Sussex gave birth to baby Archie at Londonaposs Portland Hospital on May  last year. In line with royal tradition, Kate Middleton gave birth to all three of her children at the Lindo Wing of St Maryaposs Hospital in Paddington, following in the footsteps of Princess Diana who also had her children there. In new biography Find Freedom, authors Omid Scoobie and Carolyn Durrand say it was never the plan for Meghan to give birth at the royal favourite. They write: Meghan never considered giving birth at St Maryaposs Hospital in London, where Kate delivered all three of her children. It is reported in the book that Meghan always planned on having a more discreet birth. Whereas crowds gathered for days outside the Lindo Wing waiting for a glimpse of Kate and Williamaposs royal babies, Meghan and Harry did not share any details about Archie immediately after the birth. There were no crowds and instead Meghan and Harry made their debut with their son days later in front of just a handful of photographers and one Press Association reporter. Meghan said parenthood was pretty magic, adding itaposs pretty amazing. She went on to say she had two best guys in the world, so Iaposm really happy.  Months after the birth of baby Archie, the Sussexes announced they were stepping down as senior members of the royal family. They quit royal le for a more private family le in America, where they now live in a multi-million Bervely Hills mansion. Omid Scobie has joined fellow journalist Carolyn Durand to pen Finding Freedom, which tells the story of the coupleaposs decision to quit the royal family.  Speaking ahead of its release next month, Scobie tells People magazine: A lot of damage has been done. The book talks about the fallout between the brothers and wives, claiming Meghan and Kate had a strained relationship from day one. They write: Though it was not necessarily her responsibility, Kate did little to bridge the ide. However Scobie and Durand claim that despite their dferences, the two women didnapost get on, rather they simply had nothing in common and there were some awkward moments.

She shrugged it off until she struggled to walk – and tests then revealed a sarcoma, which within weeks doubled in size to that of a golf ball. Sette, also a part-time model, was devastated to hear the only way to save her was to amputate from the top of her knee. She said: “I was so upset, I like to look after myself and try to be healthy, I work in healthcare and never expected this to happen. I can’t look in the mirror now and don’t want to as it’s too much to acknowledge that what I’m seeing in the mirror is the new me. “They told me the only way they could save my le was to remove my leg. I was diagnosed in April and my leg was gone by May. There was just no time to worry about it, I just had to take in what they were saying.” Sette, from Eccles, Greater Manchester, had a bad cramp for eight weeks before she told staff at Salford Royal Hospital. She said: “When Covid- kicked off we worked flat out, we didn’t have time to worry about aches and pains. “That is what working in hospitals is like, you forget your own pains because you’re busy helping other people. I work in the stroke ward and usually get muscle cramp in my legs because I’m always on my feet. “I had the cramp eight weeks and it wasn’t getting better, so I had a scan and was referred to an MRI, where they diagnosed the cancer.” Sette is now cancer-free and will be fully fit by the end of this month. If her rehabilitation runs smoothly, she will be back saving lives in November. She added: “I don’t want to be treated dferently or taken pity on, I hate people thinking that I need help all the time. “I tried to go out now and again after and there were just lots of looks and people staring, which was too overwhelming.“Looking over Instagram and seeing all these models I try not to compare myself.

Andrew, , enjoyed a break along with the woman on the paedophile’s private Caribbean island Little St James. Weeks later one of Princess Diana’s bridesmaids, Clemmie Hambro, flew to the island after a “personal invitation”. Ms Hambro and Andrew can both be seen in a photo from Diana’s wedding to Prince Charles in , when she was the youngest bridesmaid, aged just five. Miss Hambro, now , said she was “very lucky” to escape abuse when she visited the island in  in her early s.  A source told the Mirror: “Jeffrey revelled in his links to the royal family and British aristocracy. He would often drop their names in whenever he needed a door opening. His associates with connections to the royals go deeper than a lot of people think.” Epstein victim Maria Farmer, now , alleged he flew “at least two” girls to the US on his private jet. She said he was helped by the second British woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, but who she calls a “key co-conspirator” of Epstein.She added: “She procured girls from England – at least two. She was a creeper. [She] was kept by Jeffrey and she’s gotten off scot-free with all the c**p she did for him.”  Describing the woman as her “babysitter”, Ms Farmer added: “She’s under the radar and protected by money.” The claims come after Epstein’s ex, Andrew’s friend Ghislaine Maxwell, , was charged with grooming and trafficking girls under , which she denies. Since the claims against the second British woman emerged, another Epstein accuser, Virginia Giuffre, has claimed she was sexually abused by her. Giuffre, , has previously accused Andrew of sleeping with her three times, including once on Little St James.  The Duke and his legal team have vehemently denied her claims.But the latest claims increase pressure on him to speak to the FBI about what he knew of Epstein’s friends and what he saw.His legal team have said they have offered repeatedly to make him available to the FBI, but claim they have been ignored. At the time of her visit Miss Hambro, a great-granddaughter of Winston Churchill, was working at Christie’s in New York alongside British author Shelley Lewis, alleged to have been Epstein’s girlfriend in the early s.

Figures for NHS Test and Trace, vital to our pandemic fight, showed yesterday that contacts reached fell from % to % in a week. It comes days after a Lancet study concluded the figure needs to be at % by the time schools go back next month to avoid a deadly second wave in the winter. Experts had wanted local health protection teams to do contact tracing – but the Government set up a central programme staffed on the cheap by outsourcing firms. And yesterday, the boss of firm Serco was forced to defend his , tracers having only spoken to an average of . people each.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here But despite the damning data, bullish Mr Johnson repeated the claim he made at May’s launch. He said: “If you look at what we are doing, I think… it certainly does fit that description of world-beating. We are testing more per head of population than virtually any other country in Europe, certainly, in America they are testing a huge number.” The Government said that as of Wednesday, , had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after positive tests for Covid- – up  in a day. Separate figures show , deaths registered with the disease mentioned on the certicate.The Government also said there were  more lab-confirmed cases in the  hours to am on Thursday. Without better contact tracing, experts warn of more shutdowns.Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “We don’t need a world-beating track and trace system, we need an effective one and we haven’t got it.“If this doesn’t work it’s dficult to see how we’re going forward.” The calculation for % overall contacts took in data includ-ing the percentage of people who tested positive and were contacted, and how many contacts were reached. Both of these fell, according to weekly figures for England to July . Test, Trace, Protect in Wales is doing better but does not publish such detailed data. Prof Chris Bonell, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, co-authored the Lancet study setting a % target. He said: “The figures for England are disappointing. The system has been set up rapidly and that is an achievement. But rates of testing and tracing need to increase to avert a second wave.” Figures show while slightly more people came forward to record a positive test, few contacts are reached.  Prof Keith Neal, an infectious diseases expert at Nottingham University, said: “One problem is one in five cases, who should be self-isolating, fail to be contacted despite multiple attempts.” Despite a slight increase in positive results, Office for National Statistics data suggests just one in six new Covid- infections each week are being tested. Instead of beefing up existing local teams who have highly trained staff, the Government set up NHS Test and Trace for £m with , call centre workers taken on via outsourcing firms. The scheme’s troubles have led many local authorities to set up their own – including Greater Manchester, Sandwell council in the West Midlands, Blackburn with Darwen council in Lancashire, and Calderdale council, West Yorks. Yesterday’s data showed that for cases handed to local officials, % of close contacts were reached – and Labour now wants local authorities put “in the driving seat”. Serco chief executive Rupert Soames defended his operation after contact tracers on near-minimum wage deals described being “paid to watch Netflix ”.He said: “If somebody rang you now and said, ‘Tell me everybody you have met, been in contact with, in the last  hours, give me their contact details’, how many do you think you’d be able to reel off  “So there is an element of that and it is about % at the moment where people can’t remember or never knew the contact… the details of where they were.” The outsourcing giant is among several firms recruiting, coaching and managing contact tracers. Leaders of NHS Test and Trace say the dips are driven by a greater number of complex cases – e.g. those in care homes and hospitals. The average number of contacts traced for each person who tested positive in the past week was ., down from an average of . over the previous two months. Prof Sheila Bird, of Cambridge University, said: “Test and Trace’s poor performance in reaching identied close contacts of a non-complex index case needs explanation.” "},{"url":null,"title":"three more countries added wales","story":"NewsThree more countries added to Wales quarantine list with the rest of UK expected to follow soonEngland, Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to add Belgium, the Bahamas and Andorra to their quarantine lists in the near future, following the Welsh decisionShareByMatthew Dresch:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsWales has added three more countries to its quarantine list \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Itaposs not unusual for the umbilical cord to be wrapped round a newborn tot, but six times - without consequences - is unheard of. One doctor said they had never seen anything like it in  years.

The wonder took place at the Yichang Central Hospital in the city of Yichang, in western China’s Hubei province, and was only revealed to the world after it was confirmed that the miracle tot was given a full clean bill of health.

But they had no idea that it was wrapped round half a dozen times. They had been able to prepare for what they were about to witness due to a detailed prenatal examination.

Shockwaves smashed building facades, sucked furniture out into streets and shattered windows miles inland. Images of of the aftermath show how warehouses and storage units surrounding the blast zone now lie in ruins. Rescue crews are still searching area in an attempt to retrieve bodies from homes flattened by the blast. Beirutaposs port - the epicentre of the explosion - was once one of the regionaposs busiest but has now been reduced to virtually nothing. Other satellite pictures show the Orient Queen cruise ship capsized due to the force of the blast Up to a quarter of a million people were left without homes fit to live in while the damage is expected to cost around bn . The death toll was expected to rise from the blast, which officials blamed on a huge stockpile of highly explosive material stored for years in unsafe conditions at the port.  This explosion seals the collapse of Lebanon. I really blame the ruling class, said Hassan Zaiter, , a manager at the heavily damaged Le Gray Hotel in downtown Beirut. Relatives gathered at a cordon to Beirut port seeking information on those still missing as the search continued. Many of those killed were port and custom employees, people working in the area or those driving nearby during the Tuesday evening rush hour. Some victims were hurled out to sea by the powerful blast. The Red Cross was coordinating with the Health Ministry to set up morgues as hospitals were overwhelmed. Health officials reported that hospitals were running out of beds and equipment to attend to the injured. Beirutaposs Clemenceau Medical Center was like a slaughterhouse, blood covering the corridors and the lts, said Sara, one of its nurses. The explosion was the most powerful ever in Beirut, a city still scarred by civil war that ended three decades ago and reeling from an economic meltdown and a surge in coronavirus infections.The blast rattled buildings on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, about  milesaway. No words can describe the horror that has hit Beirut last night, turning it into a disaster-stricken city, President Michel Aoun said in an address to the nation during an emergency cabinet session. Aoun said , tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, was stored for six years at the port after it was seized.The government was determined to investigate and expose what happened as soon as possible, to hold the responsible and the negligent accountable, he said. An official source familiar with preliminary investigations blamed the incident on inaction and negligence, saying nothing was done by committees and judges involved in the matter to order the removal of hazardous material.

Seconds later the blazing warehouse they were battling to enter in Beirut was destroyed in the colossal explosion which killed at least  and injured . Even the person who took this picture on a phone has been confirmed dead. Inside Warehouse  flames were about to set off a ,-ton pile of discarded ammonium nitrate fertiliser. The shockwave, equal to that of a small nuclear bomb, devastated the surrounding area. The men thought to be pictured Jo Noon, Methal Hawwa and Najib Hati were part of a rapid response unit. Nine are still missing, including Ellie Khuzami.  Team member Sahar Faris, , dubbed the “Bride of Beirut”, has been confirmed dead. Ms Faris was to be married in June next year. Her fiance, Gilbert Karaan, posted a tribute saying: “you broke my back, you broke my heart.”  Yesterday angry crowds took to Beirut’s blast-shattered streets demanding an end to the ­Lebanese regime. As rescuers battled to save dozens believed still trapped, locals demanded millions in aid should not be paid to Lebanon’s ­government. One grief-stricken man told visiting French President Emmanuel Macron: “We hope this aid will go to the Lebanese people not the corrupt leaders.”Mr Macron told the crowd he would not write a “blank cheque”. He said: “This explosion should be the start of a new era. I guarantee this aid will not go to corrupt hands.”  Many blame officials for leaving the fertiliser to fester in Beirut’s key port after being confiscated from a ship in . The shockwave from the blast smashed up to , houses and sent cars flying. Streets are stacked with mountains of shattered glass and debris.

Amin al-Zahed was found in the Mediterannean sea,  hours after the blast rocked the capital of Lebanon on Tuesday. Bloodied and battered, a picture posted on an Instagram page dedicated to locating missing residents shows the man being held by a rescue worker. They are on the deck of a ship and Al-Arabiya reports he was rushed to Rafic Hariri University Hospital in Beirut. However, al-Zahedaposs family spoke on Lebanese TV today, saying they had checked the hospital but have been unable to find him. Have you been affected by the explosion  Email webnews@mirror It is a mystery as to how he survived his ordeal and his current condition is unknown.The Instagram  page was set up to try to help locate missing persons in the aftermath of the blast, which has killed at least  people.The page shows hundreds of people whose families are desperately seeking information as to where they are. One of these, a little girl, was found alive in the rubble  hours after the explosion, which saw thousands left homeless when , tonnes of ammonium nitrate detonated at the cityaposs port. A remarkable video which has emerged shows the moment a small child was rescued from the wreckage. Her head and arms can be seen poking out from under debris as rescuers move rubble away from her body. Little whimpering noises can be heard from the child as she is helped in the emotional footage. Local media reports that the girl spent  hours buried in the wreckage of a collapsed building.  Lebanon has declared three days of mourning as the search for victims continues and more than , people are homeless or displaced. Many homes have been destroyed, turning peopleaposs lives upside down. Relatives gathered at a cordon to Beirut port seeking information on those still missing as the search continued. Dozens are still unaccounted for. Desperate relatives have been scouring the wreckage for missing loved-ones.  A man was today pulled alive from the rubble of an apartment building. Cheers of aposIssam is alive!apos could be heard as the bloodied man was placed on a stretcher and taken to hospital. Many of those killed were port and custom employees, people working in the area or those driving nearby during the Tuesday evening rush hour.Meanwhile, a hero nurse was hailed for saving three newborn babies. The nurse was seen cradling the infants in her arms while she was on the phone in a reception area surrounded by dozens of bodies and wounded amid scenes of devastation across the city. The woman is wearing blue scrubs and a protective face mask, due to the coronavirus pandemic, in the snap taken by photographer Bilal Marie Jawish at the Lebanese capitalaposs Saint George Hospital University Medical Center.The photographer wrote on Facebook that he has covered lots of wars but he had never witnessed anything like the Beirut blast - and the hero nurse - before.He wrote:  years of press photography and lots of wars.  I can say I didnapost see what I saw today in Ashrafia area, especially in front of the rum hospital and this aposheroineapos caught me inside the hospital and was accelerating to call despite the suspension of communication holding three newborn babies and surrounded by dozens of bodies and wounded. The explosion killed four nurses and injured about  patients, visitors and staff as it left the hospital non-operational. It suffered signicant damage and was without electricity in the hours after the explosion. There were so many patients that doctors and nurses had to treat people in a car park outside after shattered glass and debris was cleared.  The Lebanese Red Cross sent teams to transport patients to other hospitals.A doctor at the scene told Al Arabiya English: “We’re bringing the patients to the emergency building, and from there, we’re trying to send them to dferent hospitals because the urgent care is also full. What can we do ”Sleiman Haroun, head of the Syndicate of Hospitals in Lebanon, said mass injuries occurring amid the Covid- pandemic was“catastrophic. Hospitals were so overwhelmed that the walking wounded were turned away so medics could focus on those with le-threatening or more serious injuries. One local report claimed hospital morgues were full of bodies after the explosion occurred amid the coronavirus pandemic. There was an appeal for blood donations as stocks were depleted in the aftermath of the disasterThe explosion is thought to have been triggered by a fire that was sparked by a welder, according to local media. More than , tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, exploded in a warehouse where it had been stored without safety measures for six years, according to officials.  As teams searched the rubble for survivors and bodies, photos from the blast site showed apocalyptic scenes with a massive crater and buildings flattened by a blast that is said to have had a fth of the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb.A preliminary investigation revealed Tuesdayaposs blast occurred after a fire was sparked by someone welding a small hole to prevent theft from the warehouse, the Lebanese TV station LBCI reported.A security source told Reuters it was started by welding work being carried out on a hole in the warehouse located in the Port of Beirut. Video posted on social media showed slashes and pops as the fire raged just moments before the explosion sent a shockwave through the city on the Mediterranean, leading to speculation the blast occurred at a fireworks storage site.  Badri Daher, director general of Lebanese Customs, said it appears fireworks were being stored close to the ammonium nitrate. The explosive material was seized from a ship in . A shockwave that obliterated buildings and knocked people off their feet was felt as far away as Cyprus, some  miles from the blast site. What we are witnessing is a huge catastrophe, the head of Lebanonaposs Red Cross George Kettani told broadcaster Mayadeen. There are victims and casualties everywhere.  Prime Minister Hassan Diab promised there would be accountability for the deadly blast at the dangerous warehouse, adding those responsible will pay the price. A number of British nationals, including embassy staff and journalists, were caught up in the disaster, with a small number suffering non-le-threatening injuries.Schools minister Nick Gibb told Sky News all embassy staff based in Beirut are accounted for.Mr Gibb added that we donapost know yet how many British nationals are affected and that the Prime Minister of Lebanon has asked for assistance.  Dozens of people are feared to be missing and the death toll is expected to rise as search and rescue teams look for victims buried under twisted metal and debris from buildings. Dazed, weeping and injured people walked through streets searching for relatives.Worried residents have been posting photos of the missing on social media as part of desperate efforts to find them. An Instagram account created after the blast now has dozens of appeals and more than , followers.There are many people missing. People are asking the emergency department about their loved ones and it is dficult to search at night because there is no electricity, Health Minister Hamad Hasan told Reuters.  A number of countries have promised to send aid to Lebanon as thousands of residents were left homeless or forced to sleep in high-rise flats that suffered signicant damage. Business Secretary Alok Sharma confirmed the UK Government is working to send a package of support. The American embassy in Beirut warned residents about reports of toxic gases released by the blast, urging people to stay indoors and wear masksavailable. The blast revived memories of a - civil war and its aftermath, when Lebanese endured heavy shelling, car bombings and Israeli air raids. Some residents thought an earthquake had struck.  An official source familiar with preliminary investigations told Reuters the incident was blamed on inaction and negligence, saying nothing was done by committees and judges involved in the matter to order the removal of the ammonium nitrate. As residents angrily demand answers, cabinet has ordered port officials involved in storing or guarding the ammonium nitrate to be put under house arrest.

It may have seemed like an arrogant thing for a criminal to ask, but this mafioso knew exactly what would happenhe told him everything he knew. Leaning forward in his chair, he said to the investigator Giovanni Falcone: “First, they’ll try to kill me. Then it will be your turn. They’ll keep trying until they succeed.” Undeterred, Falcone continued his line of questioning, and Buscetta did what no man had ever dared before - and broke the sacred Mafia code of silence on which he had once sworn his le. His decision to turn from Mafia kingpin to its first turncoat resulted in the convictions of nearly  Cosa Nostra mobsters in Italy and the US following the Maxi Trial, from  to , the largest anti-mob prosecution in history. Many were jailed for le. But he knew full well that he was also unleashing the wrath of the world’s most powerful criminal organisation. And it wasn’t long before Buscetta’s chilling predictions on the day he decided to ‘sing’ began to come true. Prosecutor Falcone was killed, along with his we and three bodyguards, in  when a massive bomb detonated beneath a highway overpass in Palermo as he drove home from the airport. Two months later, another car bomb killed his close friend and investigating partner, Paolo Borsellino. Others connected to the trial were also hunted down and murdered. But the one person Mafia assassins failed to kill was Buscetta himself, who went into hiding with a new identity and citizenship in the US, spending the rest of his le constantly moving with his we and son to avoid detection.  Even when he died in April , aged , from lung cancer, his body had to be buried under a  name - in case the unforgiving Mafia still tried to exact revenge from beyond the grave. Dubbed the “Godfather of Two Worlds” because of the power he held on both sides of the law, Buscetta’s story is now being told in a new film, The Traitor, directed by Marco Bellocchio. For John Huber, a Drug Enforcement Agency special agent at the time who had guarded Buscetta, the mafioso’s testimony was a turning point both for the once-invincible Mob and the police fighting them. “It has to be understood that Buscetta was the most important, the most wanted and the most endangered witness in American criminal history,” he said.  But for Buscetta, who had seen eleven members of his family slaughtered by the Mafia before he changed sides, turning against the Mob was as much a matter of honour as the sacred rule - omertà - that members take its secrets with them to the grave. In an interview shortly before he death, he explained: “For me, death has been like shade on a sunny day. As a mafioso, I knew I had to get accustomed to its company. It was in the rules. “The useless death of others, the unjust deaths of innocents, convinced me not to remain a mafioso.” The youngest of  children of a Palermo glass worker, Buscetta was the only one of his siblings to enrol in the Mafia’s ranks, hired at the age of  in  to muscle into the black market of flour during the war. Buscetta quickly became an influential figure in the Cosa Nostra - or Sicilian Mafia - going above and beyond his rank as a soldier, commanding a respect unseen of someone his junior. Throughout the s and into the s, he was heavily involved in cigarette smuggling, apparently organising his consignments of Camel and Pall Mall from from the Bar Commercio in central Palermo. He fled to the United States after the Ciaculli Massacre in , a bombing that killed seven police officers that was the result of an internal mafia conflict known as the First Mafia war. In New York, he was helped by the local Gambino crime family to get into the pizza business, which was allegedly a front for the Mafia’s illegal activities. After being convicted of double murder in Italy in , Buscetta was arrested in New York in June . But after making a phone call from the police station, within hours , bail money had been paid on his behalf.  He underwent plastic surgery and vocal cord surgery to avoid detection and fled to Brazil, where he met his third we, Cristina, with whom he would have four children. But just as he was building a new le, he was arrested and extradited to Italy to face trial for his crimes. He was sentenced to ten years in prison but managed to escape after serving eight years, fleeing back to Brazil while on a day-release. His escape back to South America wasn’t so much to avoid going back to prison, but to get away from the Second Mafia War being waged by Toto Riina, a merciless megalomaniac who wanted control of the entire drugs trade. Riina has embarked on a ruthless campaign that saw over  mafiosos murdered between  and , and Buscetta feared his le would also be in dangerhe stayed in Italy, even behind bars. But his past followed him back to Brazil, where he was asked by Riina to helm a drug trafficking operation. His polite refusal was seen as a betrayal, and he soon found himself in the crosshairs of the mob’s most deranged leader. In typical mafia style, Riina went after those he loved first. First, in , his two sons were tortured, killed, then dissolved in acid, their bodies never found. In the months that followed, the drugs supremo also targeted and killed his brother, his son-in-law, his brother-in-law and four of his nephews. Tired of the bloodshed, after being arrested again in  and extradited to Italy, he agreed break the Mafia’s code of silence to cooperate with Italian and American law enforcement to help take down the mob. Cristina, now , remembered in a documentary last year: “For him, breaking omertà was really the hardest decision of his le because he had this sensation that he broke something that was sacred.”  Three days after arriving back in Italy, Buscetta began his historic testimony. It went on for  days and ran into , pages, prompting Falcone to order , checks on the evidence and issue  arrest warrants - blowing apart the previously untouchable Mafia. And his decision to betray his mobster vows had devastating consequences. In an attempt to scare him into silence, Cosa Nostra killed three more members of his family, including two more of his sons. In one dramatic confrontation in court with one of the mobsters he pointed the finger at, godfather Pippa Calso, who claimed he’d never met his accuser, Buscetta thundered: “You pretend not to know me, who brought up my own two boys, the same two that you had taken out.” Buscetta was also the first mafia insider to reveal the secret inner workings of the Mafia. In an interview with French journalist Marcelle Padovani, Judge Falcone, who was killed by the Mafia in , said: “Before him we had only a superficial idea of the Mafia phenomenon. With him we began to see inside the organisation. He gave us a lot of information about the structure, the recruitment techniques and the s of the Cosa Nostra.” At first reluctant to reveal the mafia’s links with politicians, it was following the murders of prosecutors Falcone and Borsellino, with whom he had become friends, that he decided to speak. That same year, he agreed to be one of the main witnesses in the trial against Giulio Andreotti, the then Italian prime minister, who was accused of working with the mafia. Andreotti was eventually acquitted, but for the first time, the world heard of the Mafia’s extraordinary grip on those in power. “A member of the Cosa Nostra says, that president is mine, andyou need a favour, you must go through me. In other words, the Cosa Nostra figure maintains a sort of monopoly on that politician.”  In exchange for his testimony, Buscetta was sent to the US under a new identity and citizenship in the Witness Protection Programme. A safe house where he was hidden in the woods of New Jersey, guarded by a battalion of agents, was so secret that the New York prosecutors working with him weren’t allowed to know its location. Lead prosecutor Louis Freeh, who would later become director of the FBI, remembered how he rarely talked about his own crimes. He said: “He was very talkative about certain things but he never really disclosed what he did, which crimes he committed. “What surprised me the most was how everyone was just absolutely charmed by him… Everyone always talked about him as this very charismatic, very charming, very educated, well-spoken man. We couldn’t find anyone who would say, ‘He was a real son of a bitch’” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/08/2.54595272-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/08/2.54595272-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/08/2.54595272-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/08/2.54595272-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"cops raided teen pervs angus home as he was downloading sick images","story":"A teenage pervert was in the middle of downloading sick child images when police raided his home.The -year-old, who cannot be named because of his age, had been accessing hundreds of indecent images and videos of children since the age of , Dundee Sherf Court heard.A sherf placed the teen on the sex offender’s register after he pleaded guilty to downloading the vile stash from an address in Letham.It was revealed that some of the material was in the highest level of depravity.Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said police obtained a search warrant for the youth#s home where they found him and his father.A laptop was seized and a preview examination found indecent images of children.The teen, a first offender who has diagnosed autism, was thereafter arrested.“A full examination found three laptops that were using file-to-file sharing software,” Ms Robertson told the court.“These had been used to download most of the material.

He does the horrible side of being a striker very well, the side that his team-mates appreciate.“He is a team player but he has real quality as well. That’s the reason Jack Ross took him early to St. Mirren and speaking to Jack he was a massive factor in them being promoted.“He brings a lot more than just goals as a striker, he can take the ball in and for his size he holds the ball up and he is a bit of a bully at times. Danny is what we have been missing and that’s why I was so desperate to get him since January.”The Dark Blues just missed out on the striker at the end of the January transfer window as they sought a replacement for the departed Danny Johnson.“It was a frustrating one in January it went to the last   minutes of the deadline. He would have been involved in the game at Morton the next day the same way the other signings were.“He is a player who I have known for a while, he has plenty of admirers in Scottish football and you can see why.“I think it would have happened earlierit hasn’t been for the circumstances but I’m delighted to get it over the line.”After a summer of worry over the finances at the club brought by the coronavirus shutdown, prompting the first-team players and staff to take wage cuts and the budget for the academy being slashed, McPake gave an upbeat assessment of what the future holds on the playing side of things.On plans tofor pre-season ahead of the October restart, McPake said: “It’s going OK. Like everything that’s happening, it’s changing daily and it’s hard to put down anything.“What I will say is the response from the players and the fans, there is a feelgood factor, which feels strange to say.“I feel good being back around the place. I know the players are itching to get back but there are protocols and measures [to be gone through].“What we have is time on our side to prepare for a season. The important thing we said was getting a date for the season to start but we are governed by the other people that make decisions.“We are doing what is the safest for Dundee Football Club and what we feel will benefit Dundee Football Club the most.“In terms of my planning, I’m very happy with the way things are going and everyone  is fit and healthy which is also important.”Mullen joined former Dunfermline defender Lee Ashcroft as a new signing at the club and McPake is pleased with his new additions.He added: “We are in the middle of a pandemic and deals are short but you are starting to see teams signing players now.

Everyone has to play their part in this.“We know the harbour front on a warm day is a magnet for visitors from the city, but please don’t be tempted to break lockdown.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seemingly without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them. They are shackled to a UK party that appears to revel in acting against the best interests of Scotland.Those most committed to the Union will still cast their votes for the party next May. They have nowhere  to go.But polls over the last few months have detected a sht. The size of this steadfastly pro-Union group looks like it is decreasing, largely due to Brexit. Younger voters remain overwhelmingly in support of independence.In a bid to counter this, Mr Ross refers throughout the aforementioned article to patriotism, a term associated with the sort of brash Brexiteers most in Scotland canrsquot stand, and is surely no less problematic than ldquonationalism.The architects of his campaign - among them Michael Gove - have little choice but to focus on ldquosaving the Union. But how do you even begin to do this when your own party works against you at every turn  That remains the enduring, unanswerable question for whoever leads the Scottish Tories."},{"url":null,"title":"exam-results-simply-add-opinion-brian-beacom","story":"Of course, TV never records the tear-stained, snot-nosed physiognomy of those who wonrsquot make it into uni with those grades, who will have to face not only their parentsrsquo ire but their own sense of abject hopelessness for months to come.Do results make much dference to young lives  The Simpsons cartoon series once set the scene perfectly for debate: Bart Simpson revels as the brash go-getter to whom school is simply a detainment centre until he succeeds as a little Lord Sugar.

What of the  per cent SQA have altered  Why have they been altered  What algorithms ndash or benchmarks have been used Have the SQA proportioned a set number of passes to match up with schoolsrsquo previous records  One teacher said yesterday ldquoI know of a pupil who achieved a History Higher pass mark, a lsquoCrsquo, who had barely attended class prior to Covid.

Why, particularly in a time when pupils have never been less at school, their lives never thrown into such disarray  How can the evaluation process be robust The worry then is that this is quantitative easing in educational form, printing passes in order to remove the duncersquos cap from his own head.The Government also argues the dferential between state and private schools has narrowed.

For the countryrsquos exam regulator, and by extension the Scottish Government, have made a right porcus auris of matters .To recap. With exams cancelled for the first time due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was left to teachers to estimate the grades a pupil could expect, and then the SQA would step in to moderate the result up or down. Not ideal, but this was an unprecedented situation, best that could be done in the circumstances, good intentions all round, autofill as required.Yet from the outset the most important part of the process, the moderation of results, was shrouded in mystery, like the recipe for some secret sauce. MSPs, teachers and others had asked for details of the methodology to be used, but details came there none until the day the results were published, when it was too late to do anything about it.As it turned out, the SQA has been less than moderate in its moderation, with a quarter of results, some ,, downgraded.Digging deeper, pupils from the most deprived areas were more likely to have their grades downgraded than those from the least deprived areas. Among the latter the dference between estimated and actual results was . per cent. In the most deprived areas it was .%.In making its decisions, the SQA considered a schoolrsquos past results. It was not the only consideration but it was key. So it did not matter how hard a pupil had worked all year, and what their teacherrsquos assessment was: the fix was in from the start. Postcode determined outcome, and once the downgrading began one domino toppled on to the next, right down to a predicted pass becoming a fail.As Lindsay Paterson, Professor of Education Policy at the University of Edinburgh, wrote in The Herald: ldquoItrsquos bad enough to know that you have been given a B instead of an A because of what previous students achieved in your school.ldquoBut to know you have failed a course because the SQA judged your teachers to be unreliable in making judgments is offensive.: Fears teachers will be overwhelmed by appealsOffence has duly been taken by pupils, their parents, and teachers alike, and no wonder. Once again, those Scots youngsters most in need of a fair shake have been shoved to the back of the queue through no fault of their own. All in the name, in the words of the SQA, of \"maintaining the integrity of the system.Had the results gone unmoderated, we are told by ministers, the pass rates would have risen to the highest on record. We could not have that, right  If pupils from poorer backgrounds genuinely began catching up with those from better-off areas then why shell out for private school fees  Andwe start down that road where will it all end Well, we could end up with an approach to Scottish education that was more in keeping with reality than the rose-tinted, wharsquos like us nonsense we traditionally feed ourselves. You can see this vainglory in action on the SQArsquos own website, a destination much to be recommendedyou are partial to hollow laughter. There, you will learn that the SQA is ldquothe heart of Scotlandrsquos world-renowned education system.Would this be the same world-renowned education system that has seen Scotland fall down the international Pisa rankings in maths and science and struggle to keep up in reading We also learn that the SQA offers ldquoglobally recognised qualications and services to realise your potential. Those pupils who have had results downgraded were not realising their potential ndash they were being judged on the performance of their predecessors.: Job market extremely tough for youngstersAs for the SQArsquos proclaimed values ndash ldquoprogressive, enabling, trusted ndash the quango might want to have another look at those, particularly the last one, lest those snorts of laughter turn to bitter gales.The Scottish Government, headed by a First Minister who said closing the attainment gap was a ldquodefining challenge for any administration she led, has not had the easiest of summers when it comes to education. There was the U-turn over plans for a partialto school, and now fresh turmoil caused by the SQArsquos downgrading of results.It has been a tough time for a lot of people, parents especially, but the answer does not lie in piling unfairness on to existing inequality, as the SQArsquos downgrading has done.Its next task is dealing with the thousands of expected appeals. On that the SQA should do what it promised in the first place and properly consult teachers.Instead of viewing teachers as biased towards their own pupils, think of them as professional observers whose opinions are as worthy of respect as your own.The Government needs to take a grip of the situation and fast, not just for the sake of current pupils but those that come after. It is possible, in the absence of a vaccine, that we could be in the same situation next year.The Scottish education system cannot take any more dunts to its reputation. It has nothing to do with some notion of national pride. It is about being serious when we say we believe in fairness and equality. It is about understanding the problems and addressing them as quickly as possible. It is about priorities.This Government has had  years to make a dference. It is not fair to say nothing has been achieved ndash more people from poorer backgrounds are going to university, for example ndash but it is not enough and it is happening far too slowly.Scotland must do better by its poorest children.

Mr Ross has already touched on this in his initial thoughts on the leadership ndash he would like more power to be shared out from Edinburgh and, as an Aberdonian like Mr Ross, I approve. Holyrood should not be the full-stop of devolution.Mr Rossrsquos roots in Aberdeen also, I think, may explain other parts of his political thinking. Much of Scotlandrsquos image as a place of radical politics was formed to the sound of the hammer and the pickaxe ndash it came from the shipyards and factories and coal mines, and because of that, Glasgow became the capital of Scotlandrsquos radicalism, first with Labour and now with the SNP.But the radicalism of Glasgow is not the whole story. In the Highlands, therersquos a much more liberal tradition, and the further north you go, the more liberal it gets, while up in Aberdeen and down in Dumfries-shire and the Borders, therersquos a strong streak of conservatism. In Aberdeen, some of it may come from our cautious natures: radicalism equals change, and we donrsquot like change.As Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross has the capacity to tap into those feelings, but therersquos an extra factor which may work in his favour in the way it did for Ruth Davidson. Mr Ross is not a Tory toff or the kind of Anglicised Scot that used to represent the Tories. Hersquos from an ordinary background and his views and instincts reflect what a lot of other Scots from ordinary backgrounds think.Take his call for ldquotougher enforcement against Gypsy Travellers for instance. The SNP immediately cried ldquoracist! before downgrading it to ldquoabhorrent!, but itrsquos perfectly fair to be concerned about illegal camps, and this is where the metropolitan effect kicks in again: middle-class, city liberals assume everyone thinks like they do, on race, sex, gender, or Brexit, but they donrsquot. Many Scots in large parts of the country are more cautious and conservative.The SNPrsquos tactic on all of this ndash and itrsquos already wobbled ndash is to portray Mr Rossrsquos conservatism as extreme, but actually he is from a Scottish tradition of right-of-centre pragmatic conservatism that still exists. Take his views on Brexit. The SNP said he had ldquofailed to stand up for Scotland by backing an extreme Brexit but he is merely taking the view that a lot of centrist Scots now take: we voted Remain but letrsquos try to get the best Brexit we can.Mr Rossrsquos common sense was also at work in the Dominic Cummings affair. He was the only minister to resign over it, saying he could not in good faith defend a government advisor who had travelled hundreds of miles during the initial stages of lockdown, and his resignation was a good sign for his future as Scottish Tory leader. If he erges from the rest of the UK party when he sees fit, as Ruth Davidson did, it will serve him well.All of these factors could help Mr Ross connect with voters in the centrist middleas well as a large part of conservative Scotland including the socially conservative working-class parts of urban Scotland. But the problem he has is that hersquos taking over during a public health crisis in which the SNP government is seen to be doing well. It is this, perversely, that has helped support for independence to edge over %: the less Nicola Sturgeon has talked about independence, the more people have supported it.The question is: what happens when le s to normality in Scotland ie the SNP banging on about independence every day  It was frustration with that approach among ordinary Scots ndash and Ruth Davidsonrsquos plain-speaking ability to capitalise on it ndash that led to the Tory surge in . Could it happen again under Mr Ross To be honest, at the moment, itrsquos hard to see how ndash the circumstances of  are unlikely to repeat themselves in time for the next Scottish election.

especially in Texas, Florida and Arizona - just skyrocketing in that demographic.ldquoItrsquos just that smouldering fire - but as more of them get infected, the chance of them interacting with the vulnerable population increases and hits that vulnerable population, and then the inferno just begins.ldquoThatrsquos when we end up with lots of sickness and lots of disease.The problem for politicians and public health experts is how to persuade a vast swathe of the population to take the threat of coronavirus seriously when, in reality, they are extremely unlikely to become critically unwell, let alone die.According to a study by experts in epidemiology and infectious disease at Stanford University, the risk of someone under  dying in the UK from Covid was equivalent to the chances of them dying in a car crash - but onlythey drove  miles every day.Across Europe and Canada, depending on their age and where they lived, under-s were between  and -times less likely to die from the virus than those over .The large majority of the deaths that do occur in this \"non-elderly\" population are among people with other underlying conditions, such as severe asthma, kidney failure, or diabetes, or who have immune deficiencies.: Cause for alarm as Covid hospital admissions rise in ScotlandIn Scotland, based on death certicates, there have been just  Covid deathsamong those aged  to , and none in anyone younger.The incidence of Covid-related intensive care admissions in the  to  age group in Scotland is . per ,, compared to . for those aged  to .As the authors of the Stanford University study state: ldquoFor healthy non-elderly people, the risk of dying from Covid- in the first half of  was very small.\"This is in stark contrast with many news stories that focus on the demise of young people and the panic and horror that these widely reverberated stories are causing...no matter what strategy is selected for addressing COVID- in the current or future epidemic waves, it should include special emphasis in protecting very elderly iniduals.And theres the rub: the more young people - who are nonetheless equally capable of catching and spreading the infection, often without symptoms - flout the rules, the more cases will increase, and the more chance there is of the virus eventually reaching people who will get sick.But it is very challenging psychologically to link apparently harmless behaviour, such as sitting too close to too many people in a pub, to the potential to set off a chain of events that could culminate in a strangers hospitalisation.ldquoItrsquos about our risk to others, and that might make it a little more dficult to understand, says Cynthia Rohrbeck, an associate professor in clinical and community psychology at George Washington University.: Warning over surgery backlog as around , operations postponedHuman judgment is also clouded by optimism bias: the tendency to believe you are less likely than others to experience something negative.In February, researchers polled , people in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland and found half of them believed they were less likely to get the coronavirus than others, without any sound evidence for that belief.Our behaviour is also governed by the reward principle: put simply, we are more likely to follow the ruleswe perceive a personal reward, or benefit, to our actions.Not getting sick might be a reward - butyou already know that the statistics are stacked in your favour and, as time goes on, you dont fall ill, the motivation to comply flags.In trying to keep a lid on the pandemic as lockdown eases, we essentially face an uphill battle against human psychology.

Schools close and the reverberations hit the economy.. Parents begin to realise why teachers can spend up to four years in university learning the curriculum and how to teach it or, with Honours graduates, another year training to teach.. Teachers continue to work their fingers to the bone to convert deliver lessons online which the week before had been taught in class. They also deliver food parcels or anything  that it is within their power to aid their pupils.. Exams are cancelled and then Government backtracks on a decision to assess coursework, ignore teachers recommendations and trust the pupils futures to a statistical model and in the process, in regards to the efforts of teachers to continue despite all obstacles, adds insult to injury. Lets recall that old saying - \"theres lies, damned lies and then theres statistics\".. The reason for not assessing coursework of course was that poorer pupils may not have had access to laptops computers or parental support re home schooling. To assess the work would have provided evidence of the continuing disparity between social groups.. Consequently, that would have of course laid bare the lack of success in general in improving the lot of the working class, the \"levelling-up\" of society, closing the attainment gap, improving social mobility.. The model employed based on previous records, actually reinforces the attainment gap and now we have the statistics to prove it. Any occurrence of improvement is considered a mere blip on the graph the blip represents the hopes and ambitions of a human being.The whole process smacks of inertia in the face of adversity, compounding the calamity visited upon us. The lack of respect for the teaching profession by the Government is a disgrace. It now dictates that, not only do teachers pick up the pieces but risk their health in the process. It seeks to enlist more teachers to deal with the conditions Covid sets it will be fortunate to convince teachers in post to remain.Maureen McGarry-OHanlon, Balloch.THE SQA, by setting its historical precedent to downgrade students results on the grounds of the areas their schools were in, has delivered an almighty and metaphorical slap in the face to all those teachers who in all sincerity presented the grades they felt their students merited on the basis of their performances throughout their abbreviated certicate year. This decision has called into question the professionalism of the classroom practitioners.What is also inexcusable is the the degradation imposed upon the high hopes of pupils who were clearly A students by the devaluation of their efforts.As a former member of the profession, I can safely testy that a teacher knows an A student when the teacher sees one.No teachers worthy of the name would tamper with a students results, knowing full well that this would be to the detriment of a pupils future.There can be no doubt that the SQA was placed in a dficult situation as a result of the Covid- shutdown, but it ought to have shown more resilience and sensitivity in its approach to the delivery of results which should have reflected the reality of the actual performance of any student rather than the historical performance of any school.There can be no doubt that we will hear much more about this unhappy state of affairsDenis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.NICOLA Sturgeon says she wishes to be judged on her ability to close the education achievement gap between the better-off and the poorest in Scotland. A worrying aspect of the SQA fiasco is the fact that it seems designed to reinforce the achievement gap and even embed it in the system. By choosing to dictate that able students from poorer families cannot be given credit beyond some statistical average it sends the message that they shouldnt even bother trying.Given that the rules for Scottish university entrance favour middle-class EU applicants over working-class Scottish students, you would be forgiven for believing that, far from wishing to close the gap by improving the lot of our less-well-off, the SNP is designing a system which reinforces an already unfair disadvantage and bakes that disadvantage into the system, to the further detriment of working-class Scottish pupils.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.AND now for some facts.Those exam results were assessments by the teachers. You know, the folk who know the pupils. They were not by the Scottish Government or by John Swinney. They were presented to the SQA, the body that supervises exams in Scotland. It felt some of the assessments were a bit generous. So it marked them down a little. These amended results still show an improvement on previous years and, please note, the results from the schools in disadvantaged areas show the biggest improvement. Sadly not all pupils pass all exams of course, but all pupils of course have the right to appeal.Those whoseek to make political capital by distorting this very delicate situation are a disgrace.David McEwan Hill, Sandbank, Argyll.Read more: Letters: Is it right that the SQA should take a kicking "},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-dickens-mess-exam-grades","story":"SCOTTISH pupils have got their results.

This could be a golden opportunity to re-establish equal delivery costs for islanders –the Chancellor will take these calls seriously.“Almost every family in the Highlands and Islands, myself included, has a story about being overcharged for deliveries. In some cases delivery costs can be even higher than the product itself. Unreasonable charges are a barrier to growth and ease of living. This has to change.”He continued: “Delivery charge inequality affects communities represented by a wide range of parties, from Moray to Unst to Belfast.

They also provided essential trade routes to the protected waters of Scapa Flow.The medieval Viking names for farms and homesteads have long been known and studied in northern Scotland and the Isles. The new study investigated some of the names that have sea or boat connotations used for places that today are far inland in central Orkney.Names such as Greenay, meaning shallow waters, or Knarstonderived from the words for a transport vesseland a farm or homesteadwhere these vessels were moored. Warth, derived from Old Norse ‘ða’ , may also seem obscure as it is in a low-lying land-locked position today.However, there is evidence from Denmark that the same namewas used for a ‘vagttårne’in low-lying locations along water routes, such as the Roskilde fjord. Many such inland places are today located many miles from the open sea.Researchers used remote sensing geophysical methods to map a series of now infilled channels that extended north from the Loch of Harray to the lochs of Sabiston and Boardhouse towards the Earls seat of power in Birsay. The data was combined with information about the old landscape obtained from environmental records within sediment samples. These were cored from key sites throughout the area. The land is now dominated by agricultural activity and heavily modied by articial drainage networks constructed over the last three centuries making it dficult to see anything of the old waterways at the surface today. However, once the scientic data was analysed it was possible to model the pathways and link them to the nautically named locations.The results showed that a complete route from Harray, through the Loch of Banks and including a portage at Twatt over to the Loch of Boardhouse into the earldom estates in Birsay was easily achieved.The waterway network would have provided a shallow water routeway through which the Norse Vikings were able to haul both their boats and heavy goods, such as grain. Similar navigable waterways are known where in Scotland, for example, at Rubh an Dunain in Skye. This new work changes how we think about the transfer of goods and people in the west of mainland Orkney and perhaps enables historians and archaeologists to find more evidence of water transport in the Viking Age and Late Norse period in the Isles.Dr Alexandra Sanmark of the Institute for Northern Studies at the University of the Highlands and Islands said: “I am delighted with the outcome, as multiple pieces of written and landscape evidence suggested the existence of the waterway. The results will be used in our continued study of how the Norse used and organised the landscape of Orkney.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not having the energy they need makes nerves vulnerable to further damage and causes disability over time.Orkney is understood to have the highest rate of MS per capita of anywhere in the world.Researchers—  funded in part by the MS Society – have discovered a natural mechanism in the body that tackles this issue, which they are calling ARMD .The study also suggests that a common diabetes drug could help enhance this new-found natural mechanism – and prevent disability progression in the neurological condition. Although this naturalalone doesn’t provide enough energy to address demyelination in MS, further research in animal models now suggests that pioglitazone –  a drug currently used to treat diabetes – could be the answer. Dr Don Mahad, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Disability in MS is caused by a loss of nerve fibres following damage to the myelin that protects them. #Although our understanding of MS has vastly improved over the last two decades, new therapies still do not protect nerve fibres. Such protection is the Holy Grail in MS treatment — not only for the relapsing form of MS, which has ious options available, but for progressive forms too, where treatment continues to lag behind. “Our discovery shows that nerves respond to myelin damage by increasing the movement of mitochondriato the area of damage — a response we’re calling ‘ARMD’. #Remarkably, we were able to enhance ARMD and protect these vulnerable nerves using the readily available diabetes drug pioglitazone. This is an incredibly important discovery – one we believe could finally bridge the gap in MS treatment.” Over the last few decades there have been huge strides made in our understanding of MS, and there are now over a dozen effective treatments for people with relapsing MS — but these only address damage that is caused by the immune system. In order to truly stop MS and find treatments for everyone, a method of protecting nerves from further injury and repairing damaged myelin needs to be discovered.Last year, another MS Society funded study found that a dferent diabetes drug — the fasting mimetic drug metformin —was able tocells to a more youthful state, and encourage the re-growth of myelin. Led by Professor Robin Franklin, the study found metformin could reverse changes that happen to cells responsible for making myelin as they age, and restore their regenerative capacity. MS Society assistant director of research, Dr Emma Gray, said: “This represents another important stride towards our goal of stopping MS — and we believe that MS treatment could in the near future look completely dferent. #People with MS will be prescribed a combination of therapies that work on every aspect of the condition: stopping immune attacks and relapses, protecting nerves from damage, and regenerating lost myelin. It will mean no-one needs to worry about their MS getting worse.“Currently, there are no effective neuroprotective therapies available for MS, but Dr Mahad’s research demonstrates we are getting closer – and finding treatments for everyone with MS is now a very real prospect.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The PACE Partnership in Orkney is here to support anybody that may already have been made redundant or might be faced with being made redundant, and can offer support and reassurance to ensure you get all the help you need”.“We’ve supported a number of businesses across Orkney through the redundancy process, providing information and advice to staff and offering one-to-one tailored support.“While we can’t meet anyone face-to-face at the moment, we’re available to chat on the phone to give free, confidential advice and guidance on next steps.“I’d encourage any iniduals, regardless of circumstances, to get in touch.”Businesses of any size can also contact PACE to get help to support their staff through the redundancy process.You can find more information on PACE support at www.redundancyscotland, call the PACE helpline on    to speak to an adviser, or contact your local Skills Development Scotland centre in Kirkwall on  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The village of Dounby is only slightly older.The story begins with Hosen Market, which was held three times a year at Geoth, north-east of the present village. According to my grandmother, Johina Leith, nee Kirkness, who was born at nearby Newhouse in , and wrote some notes on Dounby, the market began at Hosen in Birsay but drted across the parish boundary to Magz o’Geoth’s ale-house.Grandma was told that, after Magz gave up her ale-house, JosephMackay, who had built the Smithfield Inn, was responsible for the market’s next move.“It would be good for business to have the market near the ale house, so Josie marshalled public opinion into taking up a public subscription to buy a stance nearby with proper title deeds. According to George Wylie, in his book, Showyard on the Heather, , the subscription to buy the land was raised in . But Josie and the market had arrived on that spot almost simultaneously, four years earlier.The West Mainland Agricultural Society was formed in . Two years later, they advertised a Cattle Tryst at Dounby, “for the dispersal of the Best Fat and Grazing Stock of the district.New roads and steamships meant that farmers could export and Dounby Farm, between the main Harray and Birsay road and the new junction road through Sandwick, was the obvious place to sell animals.  is also the year that Josie bought land at the junction from Magnus Smith, owner of Dounby Farm, and built his inn. He married Margaret Davie from Firth in  and by the following year, according to the Orcadian, inn and market were thriving.“The market stance at Dounby, it is believed, is the best in the mainland… It is central and easy of access from all quarters, being held at the intersection of two roads. There is a good and commodious inn on the ground, conducted in a superior manner by Mr and Mrs Mackay, where a iety of refreshments can be had and a rest enjoyed. Sometime in the s, Josie built the larger Smithfield, which held the inn, the Post Office and one or two other businesses over the years. Grandma thought that it was probably the Post Office who fixed the name of Dounby Farm onto the village. It was certainly settled by , when the Dounby Public School opened.The first Dounby Show was held on a field loaned by William Hourie, tenant of Dounby Farm and was a great success. There were over  entries and more than  spectators. I was amazed to find that my g-g-grandfather, Robert Leask of Coldomo, Stenness was one of the prize-winners. It must have been quite an operation to get the animals to the Show then. Grandma had fond memories of the days before cattle trucks.“At one time it was interesting to watch the animals come up from Dounby, past the corner and then turn for Harray, Birsay or Evie, each with their tickets on. At the dinner in the Smithfield Hotel on the evening of the first Show, it was suggested that there should be a Flower and Produce Show and it was held in the Dounby School just six weeks later. After that first year, the two shows were on the same day and the crowds flocked to Dounby.The stock show was held on Dounby Farm until the Society bought five acres of uncultivated land from James Flett of Curcabreck in  and built a wall around it.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system. By contrast, for the least deprived pupils, the predicted . per cent for A-C grades was lowered to . per cent.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that it would not be “credible” to have accepted the high pass rates as recommended by teachers.The First Minister and education secretary John Swinney both urged pupils to appealthey feel they have been treated unfairly.Both Highland Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar have said overall pass rates in the region were up on the previous year"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

It is vital that we don’t become complacent.”The Executive had this week launched a public information drive to raise awareness of the benefits of face coverings. The ‘Wear One For Everyone’ campaign will now be rolled out over the coming weeks and will help inform the public why they must wear a face covering to help stop the virus’s spread.Mrs Foster said: “Retail workers will not have to wear masks, it’s those people coming in to the shops that we are asking to wear masks.“It’s about trying to give confidence to people who feel vulnerable and maybe have been shielding and we are asking the public to work with us and listen to what we are asking them to do.”The First Minister also announced a high street task force to help the sector, which was last night welcomed by Retail NI.On Thursday the Public Health Agencyrevealed that  coronavirus clusters had been identied in Northern Ireland since May , when the test and trace programme began.Currently  of these clusters remain open and some  cases of Covid- have been associated with these clusters.Nine of the clusters have had five or more cases associated with them.

Just think of pop royalty like the Beckhams who gted their children the monikers Brooklyn, Cruz, Romeo and Harper.Sir Bob Geldof and his late we Paula were among the early trendsetters when it came to naming their daughters, settling upon Fi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie. When Paula went on to have a baby with Michael Hutchence, she kept to the family tradition, calling the little girl Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.Not all celebrity offspring, however, enjoy being called something a little bit dferent. The late David Bowie named his son Zowie Bowie — full name Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones. At the age of , the youngster said he preferred to be called by his nickname Joey, later shortening it to Joe. Now a film director and screenwriter, he is known as Duncan Jones.He’s not the only one to opt for the ordinary — or at least to rue the day an unusual name seemed an inspired and fun choice.According to a new survey by Gigacalculator, Hunter and Aurora are among the top names parents regret calling their kids. The poll also reveals that thanks to Prime Minister Johnson and President Trump, parents have been totally put off calling their kids Boris or Donald. And mums and dads polled also said they would steer clear of the names Karen, Isis and Meghan for their little girls.So, what’s it like to go through le with a name that turns heads  While most Northern Ireland parents go down a more traditional path, we have tracked down some people with, well, famous names. Elvis Kirk: ‘Lots of people don’t believe I’m called it’Elvis Kirklives in Killyleagh with his we Paula. Elvis has three grown-up children, Tanya , Jonathanand Rebeccaand runs Elvis Kirk Contracts and KC Skip Hire and Recycling. He says he loves his name.“My mother was a big Elvis fan,” he says. “There was a big family of us, eight of us, and I was in the middle somewhere. They all have ordinary country names. There was Mervyn, Sidney, Philip, Alastair who passed away, me, Ronnie, Harold and Sandra.“There was a maternity hospital in Downpatrick called Hardy Greer and my mother was in there about to have me and the radio was on. Elvis had brought the song Teddy Bear out at the time and my mother said to the woman in the bed next to her thatshe had another boy she was going to call him Elvis. And that was how I got stuck with it. “I do like the name. Everyone always says what a lovely name it is but no-one ever calls their child it. At work I do a lot of phone calls andI ring a business and they ask me for my name sometimes you hear them laughing. A lot of them don’t believe that it’s your real name. But it’s quite good fun. We used to call our business Kirk Contracts in the early years and we later changed it to Elvis Kirk Contracts and I think that has been a great help. People see it on the lorries and look twice. It’s good fun.”While some people with such a name might dread being the butt of jokes in the classroom, Elvis says he never had any bother. “The teachers always liked my name. I suppose people thought it was a bit strange but I never got any hassle about it. People liked it more than anything.”And just like the rock’n’roll legend himself, Co Down’s own Elvis has made the headlines in his local newspaper a few times... though not for his singing.“I left school when I was  and have been working ever since, driving diggers and doing demolition, knocking big buildings down and driving big lorries — just rocking, knocking and rolling,” he quips. “We took the old council offices down in the town here about seven years ago and the local newspaper put ‘Elvis is rocking the building’ in the headline for a story on it. I hope to keep on rocking for another few years yet.“I thought some of my grandchildren might have taken my name,” he says. “But not so far. I don’t even know any other Elvis. I had heard of a man down in the country with the name Elvis, but I’m not surethat was his middle name. My first name is Elvis, it’s on my birth certicate, I was christened Elvis. “It’s never given me any problems opening bank accounts or anything. It definitely didn’t make them give me a bigger overdraft.“I wouldn’t change my name. If I came back again I would want to still be called Elvis. My name is part of who I am. “Like the real Elvis I can sing, but unlike the real Elvis I wouldn’t sing in front of anyone. I keep my singing for the shower or in the cab of a lorry. I sing away there.” He adds: “I would be a great Elvis fan, and am really proud to be named after him.”Mercedes Carr: ‘I wouldn’t ever change my name ... it’s part of who I am’Mother of two Mercedes Carr,lives in Londonderry with her partner Christopher and children Kianand Kora . She was named after her father’s dream car.“My mum and dad had seven children,” she says. “And I was the last of seven. My mum said to my dad that he could name the last child. So my daddy got to name me — as my mum named all the rest of the children — and he called me Mercedes. “Daddy was a big Mercedes fan and actually wanted one at the time but he wasn’t in a position to buy one, so he said he would name his daughter Mercedes instead. Dad eventually got his Mercedes, me, and also got a Mercedes car eventually which he had for several years. “It’s an unusual first and second name, but no one really noticed when I was younger, at primary school. But when I went to secondary school people noticed and thought it was a really cool name. No-one ever said it was terrible. When I was growing up and going to school, mum and dad imagined that someone would say something to me, but there was no negativity. Everyone loved it and thought I was lucky to have such an unusual name.“My name is strange, but I do like it. I don’t know anyone with the same name. Mind you, when you go into one of those novelty shops to buy a keyring or a mug with your name on it, I can never find my name there. I suppose a Mercedes car keyring is the only thing that would have my name on it.”When it came to her own son and daughter though, Mercedes decided to stay strictly middle of the road on the name front. “When I had my children I never thought about naming them something as unusual as my own name. I couldn’t do it to them. My fear would be that they would grow up, someone would say something to them about their name and then I would blame myself for giving them that name.”Mercedes, however, says that she is glad that her name has set her apart for le — and wouldn’t change it for the world.“People have trouble spelling my name at times, there are so many ‘e’s in it,” she says. “But it has never been shortened over the years to a nickname. The only person who did that was my best friend who calls me ‘Merc’. When I’m talking to people I don’t know or dealing with banks and things, people say ‘Are you sure that’s your first name ’ I say, ‘Yes I’m pretty sure’. Then I tell them my second name and that’s the showstopper. They think I am messing around with them. “If I could change my name, I wouldn’t. It’s part of who I am. I don’t think I would suit anything . You’ll never find another Mercedes Carr, I’m the only one.”Tyrone Power: ‘It’s not bad being named after a swashbuckling hero’Tyrone Poweris from Ballymena. He is married to Wilma and together they have a daughter Andrea , and son, also Tyrone . Tragically, their other daughter Rhonda died in a crash when she was just -years-old. The retired Gallaher’s factory worker says his mother was a huge fan of a certain Hollywood movie star.“My mother was a big fan of Tyrone Power,” he says. “My name has absolutely nothing to do with the county. “Tyrone Power was famous during the s and s. “He was around at the same time as Errol Flynn and was a swashbuckling, handsome movie star. I think my mum had a notion of him. Thousands and thousands of women attended his funeral. “I do like my name. People don’t recognise it as much now, but years ago people used to ask meI was the famous actor. Now they don’t seem to react as much any more or they think it is some connection with Co Tyrone. “Tyrone, as a first name, has got really popular in the likes of America, but years ago when I was a young man it was a very unusual name. It’s not too bad being named about a swashbuckling hero. Sometimes I wished I was him.”Tyrone says that there was more than one movie star in his street.“People might find this hard to believe, but there was another young fella in my street whose parents called him Errol Flynn. “We were stopped by the police when we were out one night and Errol was asked his name and I was asked my name and the policeman didn’t believe us. “He was going to take us to the barracks because he thought we were messing him around. “Errol’s dead now, but he used to live across the street from us. The neighbours in our street had a bit of a tradition of naming children after film stars. “There was myself, Tyrone Power, an Errol Flynn, a Robert Taylor and a Joan Collins all in the one row. “The postman made a comment in one of the local papers years ago that when he came into Inchkeith Road it was more like Hollywood Bouled with all the stars. I think my mum must have started a trend.“I do like my name. I am proud of it. I’m so proud of it I called my son Tyrone also. I wouldn’t change my name to anything less unusual. It’s given me a unique take on le. My we, when we met, didn’t even know who Tyrone Power was, so she was unfazed.”  Belfast   Most ReadCoronavirus: Face coverings to be mandatory in shops and reopening of #wet# pubs postponedTributes after NI teen Lewis Flemingdies in Wicklow waterfall tragedyTwo more Co Down businesses close after staff test positive for Covid-Security alert at East Belfast GAA #attempt to intimidate# Is it a barn or a house ... councillors# doubts sink project backed by Poots,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More contemporary figures were Claire Hanna, Nicola Mallon and Mark H Durkan.Even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others Fr Paul FarrenFr Farren said the path towards peace was not easy for Mr Hume. The priest spoke of his compassion, referring to how he comforted families bereaved in the  Greysteel massacre.In a time in our world when often small mindedness and self-focus seems to be the driver, John never put anybody or any specic group first. He put everybody first, he added.He didn#t focus on dference and ision. He focused on unity and peace and giving that dignity to every person.

It was compassion - a compassion that bubbled over in the cemetery in Greysteel that drove John on the final and often lonely and always dficult road to peace.Fr Farren said this desire to create peace came at a heavy cost.He added: Even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others. His vision revealed what could be and with time and determination and single-mindedness and stubbornness he convinced others that peace could be a reality. He never lost faith in peace and he never lost faith in his ability to convince others that peace was the only way.

Mo became tearful as she read her sibling#s tribute to their father.You made us realise a border is just a line on a map. It#s in our hearts and minds where we need to bridge the gap, she said.Thorough over  years of violence, hurt and unrelenting stress, those underlying conditions you never stopped trying to address. I don#t think I ever said aloud how you made us all so incredibly proud. All you ever wanted was to make the world a better place.A statement from the Vatican said: His Holiness Pope Francis was saddened to learn of the death of John Hume, and sends the assurance of his prayers to his family and to all who mourn his loss.A message from the Dalai Lama praised Mr Hume#s deep conviction in the power of dialogue and negotiations.As his remains were taken from St Eugene#s Cathedral, Mr Hume#s long time friend and fellow son of Derry, Phil Coulter, performed a poignant rendition of The Town I Loved So Well on the piano, accompanied on the Irish fiddle by composer, Frank Gallagher.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNorthern IrelandDad made us laugh, dream, think: John Hume Jr#s powerful farewell to fatherFirst of all I would like to say a word to my brother Aidan who unfortunately cannot be with us today due to Coronavirus restrictions.VideoNorthern Ireland PremiumPandemic robs Derry of farewell befitting global statesman and its favourite son John HumeIn normal times the streets of Derry would have been thronged with heavyweight world leaders, superstars from the entertainment industry and thousands of ordinary people wanting to pay homage to the extraordinary John Hume.

But not the Nash family.Our family always voted for John, even in those early days, says Kate.Mummy would almost come into the booth with you at elections to make sure you voted for John, laughs Linda.Up in Creggan, he was always therea family was having trouble with the army or anything like that.All he seemed to want to do was help people. And it was genuine concern. He wanted a better world for us, said Kate.Hume#s views on equality and dialogue didn#t always sit well with his political opponents and commentators. But Kate says this was not the case locally.Ordinary people always respected John Hume, and they knew he had their best interests at heart. He was an honest man.Other political forces around at the time wouldn#t have appreciated that.He was a powerful man and one of the best to come out of this country. He did so much. He was the peacemaker.A non-violent man. I#m sure there were times he must have been afraid. He went right up to the British soldiers and remonstrated with them. They could have knocked him clean out - or worse. They didn#t care.I was sad to miss it, but I haven#t been well, and I respected what Pat Hume said.I have my candle lighting for him all day.We were lucky to have him. He did so much for this town.And Hume was one of the founding members of the credit union.I joined it about  years ago, and that is how I have lived my le, says Kate.Anything I have needed, that#s where I would have got the money. You could afford to go there and get a loan. It was a leline for lots of people.John Hume was a very special human being. He was non-sectarian, and he never changed. He treated everybody the same.And that#s the way you would like the whole world to be.Gerry Murray was taught history by Hume at St Columb#s College  years ago. They later became friends through the SDLP.Mr Murray went on to study history at Trinity College Dublin and often travelled with Hume to college debates.He was the world#s worst driver. He could sit there for hours, saying nothing, but his mind was churning around.He would suddenly ask a question like, #Who do you think was the best American president #, says Mr Murray. John thought it was Kennedy, he adds.I used to go out campaigning with him in , and he was adored. The people of Derry respected him greatly. There was universality about him. He could talk with anyone.If things weren#t going well for him politically, he could rely on Derry people for support.I was with him one day, and we walked into Da Vinci#s bar, and this boy turned to him and said: #Don#t let the bastards get on top of you John, just keep going#.And as it transpired the man who said that was a republican but he wanted John to succeed. They admired him.That said, some of the people now saying he was a great peacemaker tried to burn his house down. That is what he and his family had to put up with.In a historical context, he was a major figure. Unlike O#Connell and Parnell, he achieved what he set out to achieve.I watched the funeral, and it was very strange not to be there.Seeing Pat and the children, who I would have known growing up, I was half expecting to see John pop into view.He almost seemed to be there without being there. You#d half expect him to turn around and say, #Well, what about ye #It was both heartbreaking and very uplting watching the funeral.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMourners lined the streets as John Hume#s coffin leaves St Eugene#s Cathedral.

Credit: Google FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp Millisle Road, Donaghadee. Credit: GoogleMichael Kenwood, Local Democracy ReporterAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAn application to demolish a Co Down parochial house to make way for a children’s nursery has been refused on conservation grounds.Ards North Down councillors at this week’s council planning committee followed planning officer recommendations and refused an application by Saba Investments to knock down the parochial house at Millisle Road, Donaghadee.The site is within the southern boundary of the Donaghadee conservation zone. The house, a two storey villa, has been vacant for a long period, and despite having boarded up windows and a dilapidated wooden balcony, was described in the council case report as appearing to be “structurally sound.”The principal architect involved in the application, Noel Orr, told councillors the nursery plan was not economically feasibleit involved regenerating the building, and added there was support in around Donaghadee to replace the building.Planning officer Gail Kerr said the council was not against a nursery in the area, and said this could be acceptable with a regeneration scheme.She added: “Just because there may be community support for demolition it doesn’t make it acceptable under policy terms.“A good example is the old Town Hall in Donaghadee. That sat for years as a ruin of a building and would not have been seen as an asset visually to the area but it was an important addition to that conservation area.“No matter how long that sat there, we would not have accepted any plan for demolition of that building. A scheme came forward, and there has been a very successful regeneration.“Financial arguments alone are not enough to justy demolition. It is widely accepted that buildings within conservation areas do impose additional restrictions and yes, sometimes financial burdens on their owners. This has to be balanced against the wider value of the building in terms of the contribution to the historical, architectural and cultural heritage of the place it resides.”The house was built between  and , for William Henry Connolly, a mineral water manufacturer, and was designed by Belfast architect William John Fennell, who also designed the Cooke Centenary Presbyterian Church on Ormeau Road. It was sold to the local Catholic parish in the s.Alliance councillor Gavin Walker proposed the committee support the officer’s recommendation and refuse the demolition plan. He said: “I think the argument can be made very strongly for the relevance of this building to Donaghadee.“We have spent a lot of time and a substantial amount of money in the last few years to create a real feeling of historic sense and place in Donaghadee, of which this building is a part.“I appreciate it’s been empty for a long time and I’m sure it’s a dficult building for a developer to deal with. But that’s just the way things are.”Eleven councillors voted in favour of the refusal, with two supporting the application.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus: Face coverings to be mandatory in shops and reopening of #wet# pubs postponedTributes after NI teen Lewis Flemingdies in Wicklow waterfall tragedyTwo more Co Down businesses close after staff test positive for Covid-Security alert at East Belfast GAA #attempt to intimidate# Is it a barn or a house ... councillors# doubts sink project backed by Poots,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The DUP#s East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson said the alert was a clear attempt to intimidate the recently formed GAA club. East Belfast MLA Andy Allen said the alert was totally abhorrent behaviour and not representative of the area.

The club intends to continue to work with the police, the community in east Belfast, and the public at large, whose support we have enjoyed on a daily basis, to ensure the continued safety and enjoyment of our members and patrons.

Thankfully nothing was found and the alert has now ended., he said.His comments were echoed by UUP MLA Mr Allen.Whilst this was a hoax, the fear that this behaviour creates will be present amongst those who were training at the pitches last night, he said.“These pitches are widely used by all members of the community and those seeking to intimidate anyone playing sports there needs to wise up.” Sinn Fein#s North Belfast MP John Finucane called the threat despicable. “The GAA is inclusive and it welcomes people from all backgrounds and none, he said. “The sporting fraternity must stand together against this attack on the growth of the GAA and on a society which is moving forward. It’s unacceptable.” Alliance Councillor Eric Hanvey said those behind the security alert were an absolute disgrace and did not represent east Belfast.“East Belfast GAA has received plaudits from right across the community, and rightly so, in their attempt to help build a better future in east Belfast by bringing people together via sport, so they can live, work and play together in peace, he said.“Those behind security alerts such as these are clearly not interested in something so positive but rather only ision and destruction. They are unwanted in east Belfast or anywhere , and I urge anyone with information on them to contact police with it immediately.”SDLP councillor Seamas De Faoite said the alert was an appalling attempt to intimidate East Belfast GAA.“No team should feel threatened by those who seek to deny that the GAA can be just as much a part of the character and spirit of East Belfast as any other sport, he said. East Belfast GAA formed earlier this year. It received a huge interest from people right across the community to take part.The club made its debut in the Down All-County Football League last month. It has yet to find a ground in east Belfast for home matches.Its motto is together which features on its crest in Irish, Ulster Scot and English.Police said enquiries into the incident are ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact police at Strandtown on  quoting reference number    .

Although staff performed CPR and medical teams at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, did everything they could for her, she passed away.One of the doctors told me that it didn#t make sense how she could be gone in an instant, said Stacey, who added: We genuinely don#t knowa defibrillator would have saved Julie but we would have tried anything to keep her alive.We decided to buy a defibrillator for the Sunflower but the response to the fund-raising campaign on our JustGiving page has been so overwhelming that we#ll probably end up buying them for half of Belfast.Growing up I always looked up to Julie. She was funny and she was always doing silly impersonations to cheer people upthey were down in the dumps. She was caring and kind-hearted and she would never see anyone going without Stacey McCannOver  people have already pledged over £, and we aren#t stopping now. We intend to buy as many defibrillators as possible because they can save lives.Stacey said she still had not come to terms with her older sister#s death, adding: My world was blown apart a year ago when I got the phone call to say she had passed away. She was my big sister and my best friend.Growing up I always looked up to Julie. She was funny and she was always doing silly impersonations to cheer people upthey were down in the dumps. She was caring and kind-hearted and she would never see anyone going without. But there was no warning about her death no illness no time to prepare for having to cope without her.The tragedy was the third to strike the family who lost an uncle to a heart attack and a young cousin due to what medics said was sudden death syndrome.Stacey said she wanted people to remember Julie, who was married to Welsh actor Rhodri Lewis, not only for her amazing creative talent but also for the class person she was.She added: Julie gave so much to the world in  years - most than most people do in a longer letime.Next month Stacey is asking Julie#s friends to take part in Sunday hikes up Cavehill and snap selfies in her honour. On Sunday, September  Stacey and her children Alexand Graciewill climb Cavehill where the family will announce just how much money they have amassed and how many defibrillators they will buy.She said: My kids absolutely adored Julie. Like the rest of the family they still can#t believe that their auntie won#t be coming back and making them laugh the way she did.www.justgiving crowdfunding julielewisBelfast Most ReadCoronavirus: Face coverings to be mandatory in shops and reopening of #wet# pubs postponedTributes after NI teen Lewis Flemingdies in Wicklow waterfall tragedyTwo more Co Down businesses close after staff test positive for Covid-Security alert at East Belfast GAA #attempt to intimidate# Is it a barn or a house ... councillors# doubts sink project backed by Poots,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As Mr Hume#s remains were carried from St Eugene#s Cathedral following Requiem Mass on Wednesday, Mr Coulter#s musical version of the song could be heard drting from inside.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Coulter said: The Town I Loved So Well was the song he loved so well and we have done a duet on that on many#s an occasion in some weird and wonderful places.It was very poignant for me to play it for John today. It became John#s anthem and certainly any time we were in company and I was asked to play the piano, I could be sure that within seconds Hume would be at my shoulder saying #do the Town#.Mr Coulter acknowledged his friend#s singing capabilities, which he said were like every one  in Derry.He added: John could sing and like everybody in Derry, he believed God gave him the right to sing. A lot of other things, he didn#t give us in Derry but we all believe he made up for that by giving us voices.Mr Coulter said he was saddened that due to the coronavirus control measures, the numbers able to attend his friend#s funeral were restricted.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMusician Phil Coulter  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMusician Phil Coulter He said: It is sad and surely he deserved a State funeral with all the bells and whistles but there is something just more honest about this.This is a Derry funeral and sometimes the pomp and ceremony detracts from the point of it and the real point of it is, for Derry people, to say goodbye to John.For those of us who are here, it is not only to celebrate John#s achievements as a politician which world leaders have been coming forward to speak about, it is also for us to say goodbye to a very special Derry man.It is a Derry occasion and we are immensely proud of John and all he has done for this city, let alone what he has done for the country.This place was always special to John and John was always special to us and we are remembering John Hume, the Derry man.Mr Coulter who has shared a long and abiding friendship with Mr Hume said it was his friend he was remembering.He said: I am remembering the John Hume of many a night#s singsongs over a few pints in Donegal or wherever it might be.There are too many sings-songs in low es and high rises to recall but we had a lot of adventures in ious continents which were all good.

I#m seeing a lot of pages where they#re putting up pictures, but people are recognising that they#re dead.Lebanese hospitals were already struggling to cope with coronavirus before Tuesday#s massive explosion.Another problem is that many people are starving and can#t take their money out of the banks. That was already happening, Ms Alfahl said.I#m not sure, but from what I#ve seen before, I don#t think the government can support them.They need outside help now. Without it they cannot survive a huge explosion costing millions of dollars.Philip Ingram, a former military intelligence officer and explosives expert from Northern Ireland, said he believed the blast was a tragic accident with a series of circumstances that have come together to cause a massive explosion. The trouble is that a lot of countries in the Middle East are not well known for applying regulations , he added.The facility in Beirut is unlikely to be a specialist one, which in itself can lead to very dangerous circumstances.The crazy thing is, this was an official facility. The government had seized these goods from a ship. Over time it became a disaster waiting to happen. To say the government is weak and unstable is an understatement. It has real dficulty managing what#s going on in the country and this will probably not have even been on its radar.The international community promised to send Lebanon aid as it struggles to recover.French president Emmanuel Macron is due to visit the country, a former protectorate of France, today. His government has already dispatched two planes full of specialists, rescue workers and supplies to Beirut.The European Union has activated its civil protection system to round up emergency workers and equipment.The EU commission said the plan was to send more than  firefighters with vehicles, snfer dogs and specialist equipment to Lebanon. The Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Poland and the Netherlands have signed up to the relief effort, with other nations expected to follow suit.The EU#s satellite mapping system will also be used to help the local authorities establish the extent of damage. Cyprus, where Tuesday#s blast was felt, is sending in emergency personnel and snfer dogs. Help is also coming from closer to home. Iraq is sending six trucks of medical supplies and an emergency medical team and Egypt and Jordan are supplying field hospitals.Israeli prime minister said his country was ready to help the Lebanese even though the two nations are technically at war.The World Health Organisation is sending medical supplies to cover up to , trauma interventions and up to , surgical interventions following a request from local health chiefs.Belfast Related ContentVideoWorldPeople lost all that they had in seconds: Lebanese QUB student horried by Beirut devastationA pharmacy student in Belfast who grew up in Beirut and a Northern Irish explosives expert have spoken of their shock at the devastating blast in the Lebanese capital.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKBeirut blast brings reminder of Grenfell suffering as Britons are urged to helpA British-Lebanese fundraiser has said the explosion in Beirut evoked memories of the Grenfell Tower fire as he urged Britons to aid those affected.Most ReadCoronavirus: Face coverings to be mandatory in shops and reopening of #wet# pubs postponedTributes after NI teen Lewis Flemingdies in Wicklow waterfall tragedyTwo more Co Down businesses close after staff test positive for Covid-Security alert at East Belfast GAA #attempt to intimidate# Is it a barn or a house ... councillors# doubts sink project backed by Poots,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At his father’s funeral yesterday, a message was read out on behalf of Aidan Hume in which he said the university campaign served as a catalyst for his father’s career in politics. In , the Lockwood report recommended that Northern Irelands second university be sited in Coleraine rather than Derry. It was viewed as a controversial decision at the time and highly contested in the city. That same year a cross-community campaign was led by John Hume, the unionist mayor Albert Anderson and Eddie McAteer, leader of the Nationalist Party. googletag.cmd.push At yesterday’s funeral a message was delivered by Hume’s daughter, Mo, on behalf of her brother Aidan who couldn’t travel from the United States due to the coronavirus pandemic. In it, Aidan said that using a moral compass as his only tether his father’s ‘perseverance and sheer will’ brought ‘hope and history’ together. “It began with the corrupt siting of the university, driven by a total lack of respect for ersity,’ he added. The university campaign acted as a prelude to the civil rights movement and was part of a building of frustrations felt by Derry people. Ultimately the protest had no impact on the final decision but it may have saved Magee campus, which had been earmarked for closure. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann, civil rights veteran and former neighbour of Hume, believes it was the university campaign that set the tone for the former SDLP leader’s style of politics in the decades to come. At a Guildhall Square rally ‘jammed with people’ a youthful John Hume spoke not of ‘unionist discrimination’ but of the need for ‘togetherness’ to bring about reform. “There really you have the microcosm of his politics and strategy for the rest of his le, it was all there.” In  a Peace and Conflict Studies course was formed at the Magee campus in Derry, an internationally renowned programme offered by leading academics from the International Conflict Research Institute . In recognition of Hume’s peace-building efforts, Ulster University announced funding for the John Hume and Thomas P. ONeill Chair in Peace, to be established at the Magee campus. Set up in honour of both politicians, the Chair is a full-time academic position in peace and conflict resolution studies which helps to train the next generation of peacemakers from around the world. Presidents and leaders from around the world, including Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama, spoke to audiences at the campus. However, there was widespread concern in Derry when a decision was made to relocate the course to Belfast a number of years ago. ‘JOHN’S VISION’ Current SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that throughout his le, John Hume stood up for Derry and all its people. “He understood the transformative impact of education and knew all too well the structural inequalities forced upon the people of this city,” he said. “John campaigned for university provision in Derry that could deliver the skills and opportunities our people need to grow and prosper, even against the backdrop of a campaign of violence that plagued the lives of those in the city. “Delivering on John’s vision for Derry is a priority for me and for the SDLP. I am committed to ensuring that everyone in this city has the opportunity to make a live for themselves here. “Johns lasting legacy should be that we never allow our young people to be raised for export.

The single was been picked up by both Christian radio station, UCB Ireland, and Derrys Drive . And it has now been accepted to the Indie Folk Acoustic section of the UK Christian Chart  A Step Fwd, which unlike traditional charts works on an online voting system. To even have it accepted was amazing, said Louise. There are some really big established names in my category. So evenit doesnt place its great just to have that recognition. googletag.cmd.push Louise is also part of Irish music collective Wired Worship which has  members from across the North West from dferent Christian backgrounds. Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

It’s unlikely Ballyronan had ever seen anything like it. Tickets for the event cost pound. and, even allowing for inflation, represented real value for the sheer quality of the acts on show. Rory Gallagher was the headline act in the festival’s second year, and would ultimately prove to be the last, as it never ed to the Loughshore. While shortlived, the festival boasted a stellar line up, with a host of rock talent making their way to the south Derry village. googletag.cmd.push The hugely talented Pat McManus remembers the gig well. Among them was Pat McManus, lead guitarist and fiddle player in Mama’s Boys, who were second on the bill behind Gallagher on that late July evening  years ago. “We were heading off on a European tour and it was seen as a good warm-up gig for us to do as well. It was a good festival gig to get us into tip-top shape,” he told the County Derry Post. “We had an album out - Growing Up the Hard Way – and we would have been there to promote it. They must have thought they’d have the two Irish bands to headline – Rory and ourselves. googletag.cmd.push “Plus, to be on the same bill as Rory Gallagher was fantastic, we always jumped at the chance to share the stage with Rory. “He was one of my heroes growing up, and still is. He was marvellous. From that point of view, it was great. “We’d shared the stage a couple of times with Rory in Germany and ious places like that, but this was the first time on home soil, which we were delighted about.”  While McManus, a native of Derrylin in County Fermanagh, was unfamiliar with Ballyronan, Mama’s Boys did have a link to the maiden festival of . “Magnum was the headline act the year before and Mark Stanway, their keyboard player, has been in my solo band quite a few times,” he said. “This kind of festival wasn’t too popular in Ireland, but in Germany and other places we toured, you would get lots of little villages putting on festivals. “The attendance could be anywhere from , to , people, it just depends. It was a brave thing to do. It wasn’t going to be Dalymount or Macroom that Rory had done in the past. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play. “Rory was an international rock star, so to see him on your own soil, so close to Lough Neagh was an incredible thing. You wouldn’t have seen much of Rory playing that kind of festival.” While the presence of the Ballyshannon-born Gallagher was undoubtedly the festival’s main draw, a host of other stars were strewn throughout the supporting acts. Don Airey of Deep Purple shared the stage with Mamas Boys in . Deep Purple’s Don Airey, who also played with Whitesnake, Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne, guested with Mama’s Boys, themselves an internationally supported band. Magnum’s Mark Stanley was also involved with the legendary Phil Lynott’s Grand Slam, while there was also a surprise appearance from one of Northern Ireland’s finest rock musicians. “The legendary Vivian Campbell, who now plays with Def Leppard, made a guest appearance with his old band, Sweet Savage, so that added more excitement on the day,” said McManus. “It was a wonderful afternoon’s music. People were rather spoiled. His pedigree as a musician from Northern Ireland was second to none. Everybody was very excited to see Vivian there.” The eclectic nature of the festival’s line up saw rock fans from across the country converging on the shores of Lough Neagh. Larne native Gerry McNally, current sub-editor of the Folk and Tumble website, had travelled down from the east coast for Rory’s gig, having also been in attendance the previous year. “I can remember crossing a couple of fields and it was right beside the Lough,” he said. “It was a beautul venue too, right on the shores of Lough Neagh and both years they had fireworks at the end of each night. The line ups were good both years too. “You were luckysomeone came to the Ulster Hall or the King’s Hall. Gigs would have been quite rare back then, you were mostly going to Dublin for them. Gerry McNallys ticket stub for the pound. gig. “I was only getting into Rory’s music, but I’d never seen or heard anything like it. He was still in good health back then and was just a ball of energy. “Sadly, that was the one and only time I saw him. Looking back, I wish I was as familiar with his music then as I am now. I would have appreciated it a lot more. “At the time, I’d never seen anything like it. I was living in the moment, taking it in and just being awestruck. His playing was amazing. “The only other band I really remember were Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts. They didn’t take themselves too seriously, but they were a good, fun band.” Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts may not have been Gerry’s go-to, but for young fan Darren Seaton, they were the main draw. “Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts was the other band I was specically there for,” said the Belfast native, who was  at the time. “You’d always see them listed in Kerrang, they were really good, but we were there all day. You got dropped off in the morning and you get picked up afterwards. Young rock fan Darren Seaton made the trip from Belfast for a glimpse at Dumpys Rusty Nuts. “Our trip was run by Makin’ Tracks in Belfast, they used to be the main record store. You would have got your gig tickets and bus tickets and then met at Glengall Street for the bus. “The day we were there, there was also a band from New Zealand that nobody had ever heard of. I’ve no idea how they got on the bill, but they were touring round Europe. “They had a video camera with them and were basically filming us all telling them to f**k off. “Rory, obviously, was legendary. I didn’t really know a lot about him, because being , I was more into Bon Jovi and stuff at the time,” he said. “I hadn’t realised the epicness of what was in front of me and the fact I wouldn’t get to see him live again.” Despite the profanity towards the unwitting visitors from the southern hemisphere, Darren and his friends managed to make their way to the backstage area. “There was a band playing called DARE, whose frontman, Darren Wharton, played keyboard with Thin Lizzy,” he said. Darren Wharton, formerly of Thin Lizzy, fronted DARE at the Rock at the Lough festival. “We were talking to their merch guy, who had a table behind a wire fence. He was on one side in the ‘backstage’ area and we were on the other, passing money through the fence for t-shirts. “He gave us his pass and told us to go into the dining hall, so me and a couple of mates went down and had dinner with the drummer and the bass player there!” Musicians coming to play in Northern Ireland had become a rare breed throughout the Troubles, with many acts choosing to avoid coming to Belfast in particular. Despite its idyllic setting on the Loughshore, the Ballyronan festival was not immune to the threat of violence. “We got down the road to Ballyronan to be told we couldn’t get in yet, because there was a bomb scare and a Chinook flying overhead,” recalled Darren. “It was a hoax, but we were sitting on the bus for about two hours outside Ballyronan until they cleared it and we were all allowed in.” News of the bomb scare also filtered through to the bands, all of whom had shown a steely determination to perform. “I remember something about that, but it obviously was a prank, because no one passed any remarks,” said Pat McManus. “And evenit was, we were going to go ahead and play anyway because people had paid in there and wanted to see the bands. “They [the police] were probably wondering what the hell was going on with all the people gathering – it might have been that more than anything . “We were determined, come hell or high water, we were going to get on that stage and play and the rest of the artists that day felt the same.” Local rock star Vivian Campbell made a surprise appearance at the festival. Despite a hugely ambitious line-up, the festival only lasted for two years. Although a beautul venue, a lack of marketing and issues with accessibility undermined its success. “I’d say there was somewhere in the region of , people there,” said Pat McManus. “People didn’t know about it either and others were a bit sceptical, but from looking out from where I was on the stage, that’s the amount I would have guessed. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play.” One of the fortunate, Darren Seaton, sums it up well. “It’s strange that a random place like Ballyronan had these two big festivals two years in a row. It was a great day out.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s unlikely Ballyronan had ever seen anything like it. Tickets for the event cost pound. and, even allowing for inflation, represented real value for the sheer quality of the acts on show. Rory Gallagher was the headline act in the festival’s second year, and would ultimately prove to be the last, as it never ed to the Loughshore. While shortlived, the festival boasted a stellar line up, with a host of rock talent making their way to the south Derry village. googletag.cmd.push The hugely talented Pat McManus remembers the gig well. Among them was Pat McManus, lead guitarist and fiddle player in Mama’s Boys, who were second on the bill behind Gallagher on that late July evening  years ago. “We were heading off on a European tour and it was seen as a good warm-up gig for us to do as well. It was a good festival gig to get us into tip-top shape,” he told the County Derry Post. “We had an album out - Growing Up the Hard Way – and we would have been there to promote it. They must have thought they’d have the two Irish bands to headline – Rory and ourselves. googletag.cmd.push “Plus, to be on the same bill as Rory Gallagher was fantastic, we always jumped at the chance to share the stage with Rory. “He was one of my heroes growing up, and still is. He was marvellous. From that point of view, it was great. “We’d shared the stage a couple of times with Rory in Germany and ious places like that, but this was the first time on home soil, which we were delighted about.”  While McManus, a native of Derrylin in County Fermanagh, was unfamiliar with Ballyronan, Mama’s Boys did have a link to the maiden festival of . “Magnum was the headline act the year before and Mark Stanway, their keyboard player, has been in my solo band quite a few times,” he said. “This kind of festival wasn’t too popular in Ireland, but in Germany and other places we toured, you would get lots of little villages putting on festivals. “The attendance could be anywhere from , to , people, it just depends. It was a brave thing to do. It wasn’t going to be Dalymount or Macroom that Rory had done in the past. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play. “Rory was an international rock star, so to see him on your own soil, so close to Lough Neagh was an incredible thing. You wouldn’t have seen much of Rory playing that kind of festival.” While the presence of the Ballyshannon-born Gallagher was undoubtedly the festival’s main draw, a host of other stars were strewn throughout the supporting acts. Don Airey of Deep Purple shared the stage with Mamas Boys in . Deep Purple’s Don Airey, who also played with Whitesnake, Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne, guested with Mama’s Boys, themselves an internationally supported band. Magnum’s Mark Stanley was also involved with the legendary Phil Lynott’s Grand Slam, while there was also a surprise appearance from one of Northern Ireland’s finest rock musicians. “The legendary Vivian Campbell, who now plays with Def Leppard, made a guest appearance with his old band, Sweet Savage, so that added more excitement on the day,” said McManus. “It was a wonderful afternoon’s music. People were rather spoiled. His pedigree as a musician from Northern Ireland was second to none. Everybody was very excited to see Vivian there.” The eclectic nature of the festival’s line up saw rock fans from across the country converging on the shores of Lough Neagh. Larne native Gerry McNally, current sub-editor of the Folk and Tumble website, had travelled down from the east coast for Rory’s gig, having also been in attendance the previous year. “I can remember crossing a couple of fields and it was right beside the Lough,” he said. “It was a beautul venue too, right on the shores of Lough Neagh and both years they had fireworks at the end of each night. The line ups were good both years too. “You were luckysomeone came to the Ulster Hall or the King’s Hall. Gigs would have been quite rare back then, you were mostly going to Dublin for them. Gerry McNallys ticket stub for the pound. gig. “I was only getting into Rory’s music, but I’d never seen or heard anything like it. He was still in good health back then and was just a ball of energy. “Sadly, that was the one and only time I saw him. Looking back, I wish I was as familiar with his music then as I am now. I would have appreciated it a lot more. “At the time, I’d never seen anything like it. I was living in the moment, taking it in and just being awestruck. His playing was amazing. “The only other band I really remember were Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts. They didn’t take themselves too seriously, but they were a good, fun band.” Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts may not have been Gerry’s go-to, but for young fan Darren Seaton, they were the main draw. “Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts was the other band I was specically there for,” said the Belfast native, who was  at the time. “You’d always see them listed in Kerrang, they were really good, but we were there all day. You got dropped off in the morning and you get picked up afterwards. Young rock fan Darren Seaton made the trip from Belfast for a glimpse at Dumpys Rusty Nuts. “Our trip was run by Makin’ Tracks in Belfast, they used to be the main record store. You would have got your gig tickets and bus tickets and then met at Glengall Street for the bus. “The day we were there, there was also a band from New Zealand that nobody had ever heard of. I’ve no idea how they got on the bill, but they were touring round Europe. “They had a video camera with them and were basically filming us all telling them to f**k off. “Rory, obviously, was legendary. I didn’t really know a lot about him, because being , I was more into Bon Jovi and stuff at the time,” he said. “I hadn’t realised the epicness of what was in front of me and the fact I wouldn’t get to see him live again.” Despite the profanity towards the unwitting visitors from the southern hemisphere, Darren and his friends managed to make their way to the backstage area. “There was a band playing called DARE, whose frontman, Darren Wharton, played keyboard with Thin Lizzy,” he said. Darren Wharton, formerly of Thin Lizzy, fronted DARE at the Rock at the Lough festival. “We were talking to their merch guy, who had a table behind a wire fence. He was on one side in the ‘backstage’ area and we were on the other, passing money through the fence for t-shirts. “He gave us his pass and told us to go into the dining hall, so me and a couple of mates went down and had dinner with the drummer and the bass player there!” Musicians coming to play in Northern Ireland had become a rare breed throughout the Troubles, with many acts choosing to avoid coming to Belfast in particular. Despite its idyllic setting on the Loughshore, the Ballyronan festival was not immune to the threat of violence. “We got down the road to Ballyronan to be told we couldn’t get in yet, because there was a bomb scare and a Chinook flying overhead,” recalled Darren. “It was a hoax, but we were sitting on the bus for about two hours outside Ballyronan until they cleared it and we were all allowed in.” News of the bomb scare also filtered through to the bands, all of whom had shown a steely determination to perform. “I remember something about that, but it obviously was a prank, because no one passed any remarks,” said Pat McManus. “And evenit was, we were going to go ahead and play anyway because people had paid in there and wanted to see the bands. “They [the police] were probably wondering what the hell was going on with all the people gathering – it might have been that more than anything . “We were determined, come hell or high water, we were going to get on that stage and play and the rest of the artists that day felt the same.” Local rock star Vivian Campbell made a surprise appearance at the festival. Despite a hugely ambitious line-up, the festival only lasted for two years. Although a beautul venue, a lack of marketing and issues with accessibility undermined its success. “I’d say there was somewhere in the region of , people there,” said Pat McManus. “People didn’t know about it either and others were a bit sceptical, but from looking out from where I was on the stage, that’s the amount I would have guessed. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play.” One of the fortunate, Darren Seaton, sums it up well. “It’s strange that a random place like Ballyronan had these two big festivals two years in a row. It was a great day out.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thats all they needed. Twelve months after surrendering the league title on the final day, Limavady were untouchable at the top of the table. A - victory at Ards saw Graeme Eastwoods side with one hand and the four fingers of the other on the trophy. With  wins from as many games, as well as  bonus points earned, Limavady accumulated  points out of a possible . The clubs seconds were second in the league and had a Forster Plate semi-final to look forward to. The first team had five of their six remaining league games at home, where they were unbeaten during Eastwoods tenure. Just shy of their meeting with second placed Ballymoney, Covid- dragged the sporting landscape to a halt and with the finish line in sight, their season of effort was gone. googletag.cmd.push “We tried not to speak about it too much,” Head Coach Graeme Eastwood told the County Derry Post, with a tone engulfed by acceptance. His focus is on the now. After an extended break, Limavady gathered in recent weeks to pick up the pieces and plan for next season. “The boys took up where they left off, had a super attitude and we didnt lose too many players,” Eastwood continued. Scrum-half Jamie Millar transferred to City of Derry in search of first XV rugby and hooker Luke Montgomery found travelling up and down to Belfast for training and games not sustainable. Both are from Limavady and the door will always be open. googletag.cmd.push “We cant hold them back from playing rugby somewhere , we wished them well and they will be back at some stage,” Eastwood said. Last season wasnt the only time Limavady were pipped at the finish line. In Eastwoods first season,  , they topped the table by a point before losing the title with a defeat in the final game.  Coaches with some of Limavady’s new signings  “From a coaching point of view, the improvement is important. We hardly won a game up until Christmas, the year before I came in, and the following year itshows how much work the boys are putting in. “To go unbeaten last season, it shows the boys have been putting the invaluable work in on the training pitch. There were a few of them flirting with retirement, but every one of them is chomping at the bit.” Eastwood believes the club is in a strong place, both on and off the pitch. An acquired grant helped kit out the clubs gym and they now have access to three grass pitches, as well as the G facility at Scroggy Road. “As a club in the North West,you look at how Coleraine reacted last year, we were above Ballymoney and City of Derry were at the bottom ofC,” he points out. “We would like to think we are well up there and are attracting players from Coleraine, Ballymoney and Derry, who want to come to us to play an attractive brand of rugby and to a club on the up. “We have a few boys around  and , but the average age is in around ,  and . That team could stay together,they want, for the next four or five years and try and be successful. “As a club, we want to go upand we want to challenge again at the top end of junior rugby. Whatever way it has happened, we have not been able to do that. Hopefully this season we can try and recty it,” Eastwood hopes. One of those flirting with the idea of retirement was Jody McMurray, who doubles up as assistant coach after moving to the club with Eastwood. “Heruns the backs and this is probably his last year donning the boots, so he wants to go out with a bit of a bang,” Graeme reveals. Peter Wilson mixes playing with his duties as the skills coach, with Oisin Quinn now going into his second season in charge of the teams Strength and Conditioning. “He has worked wonders,” Graeme endorses. “He is very good with the injury prevention stuff, touch wood last season we had a broken bone here and there, but we didnt have one muscle strain and his inclusion is invaluable to us. He had the boys in tip top form. “For someone new to the rugby setup, he has really put his hand up to what we are trying to do over the last  to  months,” he said of Quinn, who has worked with Derry GAA teams and owns his own gym. “He has been a great addition to our coaching team and we are grateful he is staying for another season.” On the field, Limavady have had a productive off-season, with  players joining the , against only Jamie Millar and Luke Montgomerys departures. In particular, there has been an improved link with the local Limavady Grammar School. “We have got a really good connection and we are trying to build that link. Like every sport, having that link between schools and the youth setup is very important. Teams cant survive with bringing in playersevery year,” Eastwood added. He has high hopes for Ben McMillan, who has came in as hooker from the school, prop John McMichael s from the Academy and another from the Grammar School, Joe McCartney, younger brother of full-back Jim. “We have a really good mix,” Eastwood continued. “On top of that, we have brought in Craig Hueywho brings over  years of AIL senior experience, Jack Beattie a winger from Derry who played at Ulster youth level has also joined. “We have kept Jody McMurray, who has over  years experience, and Stuart Morrow who is an ex-club international.” Eastwood feels his side punches above their weight and with the disappointing end to the season, there will be a renewed vigour to finish the job this time. “All we can do is prepare as best we can and hopefully everything unfolds in front of us”, he said, referring to the complications of preparing a team with the cloud of a second Covid spike a possibility. “We know it is going to be dficult, other teams will be playing catchup and will have done their best over the summer to make sure they are strong as possible “I always day  we keep our own house in order and worry about how we train and play, then we will never be too far away,” Eastwood added. He feels the club would hold their own in Division , should they advance at the end of the season when it begins. “If you look at where theyhave come from, six years ago they were in Division  and not knowing where they were going. “Now you have ex internationals and boys leaving AIL clubs to come to Limavady because of what we are trying to do down here, it is exciting times,” Eastwood states. Its all with the sobering thought of needing to deliver. He uses the statement - nobody remembers anybody that doesnt win anything – to remind himself of what is at stake. “We are unfortunate, in that we couldve had two league titles in two years. We got beat in the semi-final of a junior cup, we won the conference Division , one the club has never won. “We want the big one. If you are top of the tree after  games, you are the best team that season and hopefully we can go a bit further this year and try and win it.” Thats the focus. It is that simple. Eastwood has organised games with AIL side Ballymena and Ulster Division  side Cooke for September. “They are two good tests, so we can be where we want to be at for our first league game. It will give us a few weeks to fix anything we see is needing addressed,” Eastwood concludes. The new season is about unfinished business.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thats all they needed. Twelve months after surrendering the league title on the final day, Limavady were untouchable at the top of the table. A - victory at Ards saw Graeme Eastwoods side with one hand and the four fingers of the other on the trophy. With  wins from as many games, as well as  bonus points earned, Limavady accumulated  points out of a possible . The clubs seconds were second in the league and had a Forster Plate semi-final to look forward to. The first team had five of their six remaining league games at home, where they were unbeaten during Eastwoods tenure. Just shy of their meeting with second placed Ballymoney, Covid- dragged the sporting landscape to a halt and with the finish line in sight, their season of effort was gone. googletag.cmd.push “We tried not to speak about it too much,” Head Coach Graeme Eastwood told the County Derry Post, with a tone engulfed by acceptance. His focus is on the now. After an extended break, Limavady gathered in recent weeks to pick up the pieces and plan for next season. “The boys took up where they left off, had a super attitude and we didnt lose too many players,” Eastwood continued. Scrum-half Jamie Millar transferred to City of Derry in search of first XV rugby and hooker Luke Montgomery found travelling up and down to Belfast for training and games not sustainable. Both are from Limavady and the door will always be open. googletag.cmd.push “We cant hold them back from playing rugby somewhere , we wished them well and they will be back at some stage,” Eastwood said. Last season wasnt the only time Limavady were pipped at the finish line. In Eastwoods first season,  , they topped the table by a point before losing the title with a defeat in the final game.  Coaches with some of Limavady’s new signings  “From a coaching point of view, the improvement is important. We hardly won a game up until Christmas, the year before I came in, and the following year itshows how much work the boys are putting in. “To go unbeaten last season, it shows the boys have been putting the invaluable work in on the training pitch. There were a few of them flirting with retirement, but every one of them is chomping at the bit.” Eastwood believes the club is in a strong place, both on and off the pitch. An acquired grant helped kit out the clubs gym and they now have access to three grass pitches, as well as the G facility at Scroggy Road. “As a club in the North West,you look at how Coleraine reacted last year, we were above Ballymoney and City of Derry were at the bottom ofC,” he points out. “We would like to think we are well up there and are attracting players from Coleraine, Ballymoney and Derry, who want to come to us to play an attractive brand of rugby and to a club on the up. “We have a few boys around  and , but the average age is in around ,  and . That team could stay together,they want, for the next four or five years and try and be successful. “As a club, we want to go upand we want to challenge again at the top end of junior rugby. Whatever way it has happened, we have not been able to do that. Hopefully this season we can try and recty it,” Eastwood hopes. One of those flirting with the idea of retirement was Jody McMurray, who doubles up as assistant coach after moving to the club with Eastwood. “Heruns the backs and this is probably his last year donning the boots, so he wants to go out with a bit of a bang,” Graeme reveals. Peter Wilson mixes playing with his duties as the skills coach, with Oisin Quinn now going into his second season in charge of the teams Strength and Conditioning. “He has worked wonders,” Graeme endorses. “He is very good with the injury prevention stuff, touch wood last season we had a broken bone here and there, but we didnt have one muscle strain and his inclusion is invaluable to us. He had the boys in tip top form. “For someone new to the rugby setup, he has really put his hand up to what we are trying to do over the last  to  months,” he said of Quinn, who has worked with Derry GAA teams and owns his own gym. “He has been a great addition to our coaching team and we are grateful he is staying for another season.” On the field, Limavady have had a productive off-season, with  players joining the , against only Jamie Millar and Luke Montgomerys departures. In particular, there has been an improved link with the local Limavady Grammar School. “We have got a really good connection and we are trying to build that link. Like every sport, having that link between schools and the youth setup is very important. Teams cant survive with bringing in playersevery year,” Eastwood added. He has high hopes for Ben McMillan, who has came in as hooker from the school, prop John McMichael s from the Academy and another from the Grammar School, Joe McCartney, younger brother of full-back Jim. “We have a really good mix,” Eastwood continued. “On top of that, we have brought in Craig Hueywho brings over  years of AIL senior experience, Jack Beattie a winger from Derry who played at Ulster youth level has also joined. “We have kept Jody McMurray, who has over  years experience, and Stuart Morrow who is an ex-club international.” Eastwood feels his side punches above their weight and with the disappointing end to the season, there will be a renewed vigour to finish the job this time. “All we can do is prepare as best we can and hopefully everything unfolds in front of us”, he said, referring to the complications of preparing a team with the cloud of a second Covid spike a possibility. “We know it is going to be dficult, other teams will be playing catchup and will have done their best over the summer to make sure they are strong as possible “I always day  we keep our own house in order and worry about how we train and play, then we will never be too far away,” Eastwood added. He feels the club would hold their own in Division , should they advance at the end of the season when it begins. “If you look at where theyhave come from, six years ago they were in Division  and not knowing where they were going. “Now you have ex internationals and boys leaving AIL clubs to come to Limavady because of what we are trying to do down here, it is exciting times,” Eastwood states. Its all with the sobering thought of needing to deliver. He uses the statement - nobody remembers anybody that doesnt win anything – to remind himself of what is at stake. “We are unfortunate, in that we couldve had two league titles in two years. We got beat in the semi-final of a junior cup, we won the conference Division , one the club has never won. “We want the big one. If you are top of the tree after  games, you are the best team that season and hopefully we can go a bit further this year and try and win it.” Thats the focus. It is that simple. Eastwood has organised games with AIL side Ballymena and Ulster Division  side Cooke for September. “They are two good tests, so we can be where we want to be at for our first league game. It will give us a few weeks to fix anything we see is needing addressed,” Eastwood concludes. The new season is about unfinished business.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Banagher defeated their neighbours in the  and  semi-finals before going down to Slaughtneil. The Lynchs have brought through a host of new players in the intervening years from their Ulster minor winning teams and have went toe to toe with the Emmets in the last two seasons. Geoffrey McGonigle has added to his management team. Former Dunloy goalkeeper Shane Elliott and Ryan ONeill join Ronan McCloskey in the setup. In a change to their team structure, Derry goalkeeper Sean Kelly played outfield last season but he has replaced BJ Lagan between the posts. googletag.cmd.push In the first round this season, they were - to - ahead against Swatragh and were cruising but failed to match the Swatragh workrate before losing their stranglehold of the game. In their game, Banagher led Coleraine by five points after the first quarter but it was the visitors to Fr McNally Park who took control. Darragh Cartins last gasp free earned them a draw but Banaghers body language told a story of dejection. The one thing that will raise them will be the sight of the Kevin Lynchs jersey and local bragging rights is everything. They met in the league last season and it was hell for leather. googletag.cmd.push Selector Ronan McCloskey stated after the Swatragh game that his side had plenty to improve on and they will be keen to put the record straight. In the other game in the section, all is to play for as Swatragh take on Coleraine, two teams who will have taken a lot out of their first round outings. For Coleraine manager Brendan McNicholl, it will be about assessing who all is available after last weekends football championship. It was touch and gothey would even get a team to play Banagher, such is their limited squad. They were minus Ruairi Mooney, Liam and Barry McGoldrick. Swatragh were upbeat after their spirited display in the Kevin Lynch Park monsoon but Declan McGuckin and Seamus Bradley will need to address their poor start that left them with a mountain to climb. They will need to get more scores from open playthey are to see off Coleraine. In the other group, merciless Slaughtneil take on Lavey where a win would seal a semi-final berth and allow breathing space during a hectic period for dual players. Gerald Bradley didnt start against Screen and could come into contention, but Michael McShane will be without Karl McKaigue following his Achilles tendon injury. The champions will have to plan without the suspended Jerome McGuigan but they have plenty more in reserve. Liam Cassidy, Prionsias Burke, Cormac McKenna and minor star Shea Cassidy could all come into the selection thoughts. Lavey lost Ryan Mulholland with broken fingers in their win over Na Magha and will need to offer more in front of the posts, with Johnny McGarveys side hitting close to  wides in their opener. Fintan Bradley, Paddy Henry and Ciaran Hendry were their scorers, but its hard to see them getting anything from this game. Ballinascreen manager Cathal McDaid will be looking for a reaction from his sides heavy defeat at Emmet Park to take into their clash with Na Magha. They will take positives with the appetite shown in the opening  minutes and how the use of Martin Mulgrews short puck-outs worked. Paul Cleary is carrying all their scoring threat and that will be a concern. Na Magha, minus Alan Grant, stuck with Lavey every step of the way and they will be keen to build on that as they strive to break away from their tag as a junior team. A win for Ballinascreen could setup a showdown with Lavey in Round , where the winner would advance to the senior semi-finals. The top two teams from each section will advance to the senior semi-finals, where the losers will play in the intermediate final. The bottom two teams in each group will make up the junior championship semi-finals.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Regularly setting top  times throughout the event, the -year-old and co-driver Keaton Williams soon got to grips with the unique Italian roads, to complete their first event since March’s Covid- lockdown halted all rallying in Ireland and the UK. The duo also upheld Irish honours at the event, with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy entering two drivers on the event which saw no less than  Hyundai i R’s tackle the event, joining World Rally Championship stars Ott Taumlnak and Thierry Neuville in their i Coupe WRC’s. googletag.cmd.push Like most aspiring young rally drivers, McErlean’s season was decimated by the Covid- outbreak and had his  plans quashed by the cancellation of the British Rally Championship earlier in the year. After a tricky opening round of the BRC in Wales in which the  Junior BRC champion impressed onlookers with a string of top five times, he was eager toto the stages and thanks to the help of the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing, a deal was done to head to Italy for Rally di Alba. Although McErlean, the current Billy Coleman Award winner, had technically competed in Italy before, at the Monza Rally Show, the event would mark his first closed road event in the Hyundai outside of Ireland and with over  kilometers of special stages ahead, McErlean would need to focus all his energy on theto competitive action. googletag.cmd.push A loop of three stages would be repeated three times and whilst becoming more familiar with the stages would inevitably assist McErlean, the loose gravel and rocks pulled onto the stages with each pass offered an additional hazard, especially towards the closing stages of the rally.After a positive pre-event Shakedown on Saturday, McErlean was eager to settle into a comfortable rhythm on the stages in his Michelin shod Hyundai and opened his account with an impressive thoverall stage time on the first test of the event with many experienced Italian crews behind. His form continued throughout the opening loop to land thoverall after three stages. Fourteenth fastest on the fourth counter was a highlight and an indication of just how well McErlean was bedding into the Italian roads, climbing one place to thin the process. Sadly, a technical issue on the fth stage meant he and Williams would have to carry out roadside repairs to the i R before heading into the sixth test. Those repairs would eat into his road section time, handing him an unfortunate -second penalty before he was able to attempt the stage. Luckily McErlean was able to nurse the i back to service where the Philip Case Rallysport team worked against the clock to get the Hyundai back to full health. A mature drive over the final three stages saw McErlean further cement his position toto Alba with an impressive top twenty result. “I’m delighted to have reached the finish today and although it wasn’t entirely trouble-free, I really enjoyed the experience, it was a real honour to compete on such a fantastic occasion and with an amazing atmosphere,”said McErlean. “We came here with a clear goal to get experience and build the pace throughout the rally and I feel we did just that. Analysing the times and considering the lack of experience in Italy it was very much mission accomplished throughout the weekend and without the time penalty, the result would have been as good as I could wish for. I’m happy with the way both Keaton and I managed the situation we found ourselves in and got the job done on the way to the sixth test to enable us to carry on. Resilience and thinking on your feet are a key focus of the Motorsport Rally Academy so we were very able to put that into practice. The pace this weekend shows that I`m heading very much in the right direction and I am eager to make more plans to take that forward during the remainder of the season. I’d like to thank all our backers, Sean McHugh and John Coyne from the MI Rally Academy, Andrew Johns from Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing and Tim Hoare from Michelin for all their invaluable support once again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Regularly setting top  times throughout the event, the -year-old and co-driver Keaton Williams soon got to grips with the unique Italian roads, to complete their first event since March’s Covid- lockdown halted all rallying in Ireland and the UK. The duo also upheld Irish honours at the event, with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy entering two drivers on the event which saw no less than  Hyundai i R’s tackle the event, joining World Rally Championship stars Ott Taumlnak and Thierry Neuville in their i Coupe WRC’s. googletag.cmd.push Like most aspiring young rally drivers, McErlean’s season was decimated by the Covid- outbreak and had his  plans quashed by the cancellation of the British Rally Championship earlier in the year. After a tricky opening round of the BRC in Wales in which the  Junior BRC champion impressed onlookers with a string of top five times, he was eager toto the stages and thanks to the help of the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing, a deal was done to head to Italy for Rally di Alba. Although McErlean, the current Billy Coleman Award winner, had technically competed in Italy before, at the Monza Rally Show, the event would mark his first closed road event in the Hyundai outside of Ireland and with over  kilometers of special stages ahead, McErlean would need to focus all his energy on theto competitive action. googletag.cmd.push A loop of three stages would be repeated three times and whilst becoming more familiar with the stages would inevitably assist McErlean, the loose gravel and rocks pulled onto the stages with each pass offered an additional hazard, especially towards the closing stages of the rally.After a positive pre-event Shakedown on Saturday, McErlean was eager to settle into a comfortable rhythm on the stages in his Michelin shod Hyundai and opened his account with an impressive thoverall stage time on the first test of the event with many experienced Italian crews behind. His form continued throughout the opening loop to land thoverall after three stages. Fourteenth fastest on the fourth counter was a highlight and an indication of just how well McErlean was bedding into the Italian roads, climbing one place to thin the process. Sadly, a technical issue on the fth stage meant he and Williams would have to carry out roadside repairs to the i R before heading into the sixth test. Those repairs would eat into his road section time, handing him an unfortunate -second penalty before he was able to attempt the stage. Luckily McErlean was able to nurse the i back to service where the Philip Case Rallysport team worked against the clock to get the Hyundai back to full health. A mature drive over the final three stages saw McErlean further cement his position toto Alba with an impressive top twenty result. “I’m delighted to have reached the finish today and although it wasn’t entirely trouble-free, I really enjoyed the experience, it was a real honour to compete on such a fantastic occasion and with an amazing atmosphere,”said McErlean. “We came here with a clear goal to get experience and build the pace throughout the rally and I feel we did just that. Analysing the times and considering the lack of experience in Italy it was very much mission accomplished throughout the weekend and without the time penalty, the result would have been as good as I could wish for. I’m happy with the way both Keaton and I managed the situation we found ourselves in and got the job done on the way to the sixth test to enable us to carry on. Resilience and thinking on your feet are a key focus of the Motorsport Rally Academy so we were very able to put that into practice. The pace this weekend shows that I`m heading very much in the right direction and I am eager to make more plans to take that forward during the remainder of the season. I’d like to thank all our backers, Sean McHugh and John Coyne from the MI Rally Academy, Andrew Johns from Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing and Tim Hoare from Michelin for all their invaluable support once again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by. Miceal Rooney put Kilcoo two clear five minutes from the short whistle, while OrsquoHiggins scored a beauty right on half time to leave it - to - to Mickey Moranrsquos side.The lsquoFord got the best possible start to the second half with Conor Maginn and substitute Cathal Burns finding their range to put them ahead. It was tit for tat for the next phase of the game and with ten minutes left Kilcoo lead by one thanks to scores from Jerome Johnston, Paul Greenan and Conor Laverty.The games turning point came on the rd minute. A brilliant move involving Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Ryan Johnston and Miceal Rooney placed the ing Ceilum Doherty in and he palmed home from close range.The home side never gave in though and showed great resolve, Marc Reid even coming up to point from distance in what was a superb inidual score and one of the highlights of the game.But the Magpies held out, Doherty adding a good score to seal the three-point victory margin.Bryansford: Marc Reid , Stephen Toner, Ryan McDonald, Aaron McDonald, Timmy Hanna, Conor Maginn , Danny Savage , Fintan Canavan, Conor Devlin, Corey Laverty, Ryan OrsquoHiggins , Paddy Sheridan , Thomas McAnerney, David McKenna, Daniel McDonald.Subs used: Cathal Burns , Chris Clarke , Jack Maginn, Niall OrsquoHiggins, Lewis Casement.Cill Chua: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Ryan McEvoy, Tiernan Fettes, Miceal Rooney , Darryl Branagan, Eugene Branagan, Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Paul Greenan , Shealan Johnston, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty , Martin Devlin , Ryan Johnston, Niall McEvoy.Subs used:Ceilum Doherty , Felim McGreevy.Referee: Neil Cousins .Bryansford -Cill Chua -ACFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Downpatrick motorists facing further disruption  ","story":"MOTORISTS are bracing themselves for five weeks of town centre disruption in Downpatrick.Work on a pound, sewer improvement scheme starts next week, with NI Water contractors focusing on key areas.They include New Bridge Street, Church Street, Bridge Street, Saul Street, Saul Road, Marian Park, Drumlin Park, Scotch Street, Market Street, Market Lane, Stream Street, Racecourse Hill, Ardglass Road, Edward Street, Knocknashinna Road and the Knockchree Road.A number of short lane closures are expected, with two-way traffic maintained at all locations using temporary traffic controls.Vehicular access for residents and businesses will also be maintained as far as possible but there may be some slight delays according to NI Water which has confirmed that pedestrian access will be available at all times. Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C August 5%2C 2000  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district.

MartinThursday, th August , : pm\"\"Extending southern presidential vote into NI is an insidious proposal which will promote further ision hereThe parties to the  Belfast Agreement, endorsed in a referendum, committed themselves to ‘partnership, equality and mutual respect as the basis of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South, and between these islands’. In terms of North and South, the ‘totality of relationships’ was spelled out in detail.The Republic of Ireland removed its territorial claim on Northern Ireland and, in , a North South Ministerial Council was created to oversee co-operation between the two jurisdictions.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Letter to the editorThe removal of the South’s claim represented official recognition of, and respect for, Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom, as affirmed where in the agreement.More than twenty years later, however, the Southern government — backed by nationalists in Northern Ireland — is seeking to re-ignite irredentism by including in its programme for government a referendum on the extension of presidential elections into Northern Ireland.This is not provided for as part of the totality of north-south relationships. It was not agreed in , and no agreement with unionists in Northern Ireland or the UK government is being sought. It is a unilateral breach of the Belfast Agreement. What was the point of removing a theoretical irredentist claimit was to be replaced by irredentism in practice Proponents of extending the electorate for the Southern president into Northern Ireland argue that it is commonplace for states to allow citizens resident abroad to vote in elections, and particularly presidential elections. This is disingenuous. The situation between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is unique. First, no state in the world other than the Irish Republic extends its citizenship as of right to people born in a particular region of a neighbouring state. Second, none has entered into a treaty with another state defining the ‘totality of relationships’ with it. Third, where voting rights are granted to citizens resident abroad it iniably requires them to have lived in the state and have had a home address within the state: this is not the case with people born in Northern Ireland, most of whom have never lived in the Republic.This is an insidious proposal which will have the effect of promoting further ision in Northern Ireland, with a de facto nationalist-only election, and treating the province as though it were part of the Republic. While the intentions of proponents in the South are not clear, from the perspective of nationalists in Northern Ireland, this is part of a process of re-orienting politics towards the Republic and away from the UK, with a view to undermining people’s sense of belonging to the UK and thus manipulating the context for a future ‘border poll’. In this sense, it can be seen as part of a strategy that also involves encouraging Southern parties to organise in Northern Ireland, seeking to remove automatic UK citizenship from Northern Ireland people and, of course, promoting an economic border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. It is not surprising that Emma De Souza, who campaigned unsuccessfully to remove automatic UK citizenship has now been appointed as a campaigner for this further nationalist cause.But why is the proposal being met with indference from unionists and the UK government  Why is there no protest  Why are nationalists allowed to disrespect the Belfast Agreement, continually pushing the envelope beyond what was agreed  Why are they apparently pushing at an open door J.
