In one in New York, a user said the company removed Gamestop during an \u0027unprecedented stock rise\u0027. The controversial stock trading platform denied the accusations on Saturday saying that it forced users to sell shares of GameStop last week - unless those shares were bought using borrowed funds. \u0027Claims that Robinhood proactively sold customers\u0027 shares outside of our standard margin-related sellouts or options assignment procedures are false,\u0027 a Robinhood spokesperson told DailyMail.com on Saturday.Buying shares \u0027on margin\u0027 means using funds lent from the broker, and it is not unusual for brokers to automatically liquidate such shares if an account falls below minimum balance requirements. On Robinhood, users need an account balance of at least $2,000 to trade on margin.Robinhood\u0027s restrictions on GameStop shares spurred furious accusations that the company was trying to tank the stock for nefarious purposes, but Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev strongly denied the allegations. He said the company clamped down in order meet deposit requirements at the main trading clearinghouse amid extreme volatility.  The Securities and Exchange Commission suggested in a statement on Friday that it is looking into the matter.The SEC said it will \u0027closely review actions taken by regulated entities that may disadvantage investors or otherwise unduly inhibit their ability to trade certain securities.\u0027 On Friday, Robinhood lifted its total ban on buying GameStop stock, but limited users to accumulating only one share, unless they already owned more. On Friday, Vlad Tenev refuted the \u0027conspiracy theory\u0027 that hedge funds prompted his company to halt trading on GameStop. During an interview with Yahoo Finance, Tenev was asked to set the record straight on why the mobile brokerage firm made the decision to restrict trades involving GameStop shares as prices surged last week. \u0027Oh, on that conspiracy theory, I think I\u0027ve over and over again said that it\u0027s not true,\u0027 Tenev said. \u0027Our decision to temporarily restrict customers from buying certain securities had nothing to do with a market maker or a market participant or anyone like that putting pressure on us or asking us to do that. \u0027It was entirely about market dynamics and clearinghouse deposit requirements, as per regulation,\u0027 he added.  Opinion | Reddit C.E.O. on GameStop and the Forum Shaking Up Wall Street - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Joanna Cherry sacked SNPs Westminster frontbench","story":"Share this article Ms Cherry has also been an outspoken critic of Ms Sturgeon and is viewed as a likely future SNP leadership candidate. She hit out in November last year as she said the SNP \u0027shouldn\u0027t be about the cult of leader, whether it\u0027s Alex or Nicola, or anyone else\u0027. She had been serving as the party\u0027s justice and home affairs spokeswoman at Westminster.

Here are the steps you need to take in order to navigate the new trading landscape and keep your business movingWhen Jem Skelding started his natural ingredients business Naissance in 2005, it was, he remembers, “just me, a laptop and a phone in a tiny spare room, using my credit card to buy stock”.Sixteen years on, the Neath-based firm has ballooned into a £25m turnover business employing more than 100 people. Trading with the European Union (EU) has buoyed much of that success today, roughly two-thirds of its sales come from the EU. Such is the popularity of its ethically-sourced oils in Europe that when Covid-19 hit Italy in early 2020, Naissance saw increased demand for its aloe vera gel and vegetable glycerine as Italian people started making their own handwashes and sanitisers – at a time when shop stock was low.The Brexit deal announced on Christmas Eve – and implemented on 1 January – means that firms such as Naissance can continue selling to EU customers without paying tariffs. However, the end of the UK transition period on 31 December also meant a number of changes to customs checks and paperwork that British businesses now need to familiarise themselves with. Being unprepared could trigger disruption and increased costs for businesses. As Skelding says: “If the paperwork isn’t correct, it could cause delays – meaning customers may not get their products when they need them.”Skelding’s advice to other SMEs is simple: “Don’t bury your head in the sand. If you’re struggling, there is help out there, such as at gov.uktransition, which has a useful checklist to make sure you’ve ticked all the boxes. There’s light at the end of the tunnel. Whenever there’s substantial change, there are opportunities too.”Find a customs agentAn estimated 250,000 businesses will be making customs declarations for the first time in 2021, which now need to be completed for any goods leaving or entering the UK via the EU. Customs declarations can be complex, so many firms usually appoint a customs agent to do the paperwork for them. You can find a list of approved agents at gov.ukguidancelist-of-customs-agents-and-fast-parcel-operators.Get an EORI numberTo move goods between Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) or the Isle of Man to any country overseas, businesses need an EORI number. Without an EORI, it’ll take HMRC much longer to clear your goods at the border, resulting in unwanted delays and possibly expensive storage costs. To transport goods between Great Britain and the EU, you’ll need an EORI with a “GB” prefix. And your EU partners will need an EORI with an “EU” prefix if they want to receive your goods (make sure you check they have this). Applying takes less than 10 minutes at gov.ukeori.Use government assistanceAfter a tough year when many businesses have undergone economic strain due to Covid-19, assistance is available so companies can adjust to the new processes, such as:Duty defermentPaying customs charges for each inidual consignment imported from the EU is time-consuming. Consider a duty deferment account, which enables firms to pay once a month via direct debit.Postponed accountingIf a business imports goods from the EU, it may need to pay import VAT on them. However, by using postponed accounting, businesses can avoid paying this at UK ports and airports, simply accounting for it on their next VAT return instead.Delayed paymentsFull border controls on goods entering the UK will not apply until 1 July 2021, with border checks staggered into three stages. If you’re not importing goods such as alcohol and tobacco, you can delay payments and defer submitting customs declarations for up to six months.The UK government has a Brexit checker tool, which provides information for businesses on how they can adapt to the new trading landscape at gov.uktransition.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

It is understood an additional 50 stores have permanently shut since administrators were appointed in November. Warehouse and head office jobs are also at risk.Only 300 head office staff will be saved as part of the Asos deal, to help with design, buying and retail partnerships. An administrators’ report seen by the  last week showed that Topshop and Topman alone employ about 4,792 staff. Arcadia Group as a whole employed 13,000 staff and had 500 stores across the UK when it entered administration in November.Asos paid £330m in total, including £265m for the brands and £65m for current and future stock.The deal does not include any of Arcadia’s warehouses or its distribution centre in Daventry. The Asos chief executive, Nick Beighton, said the company already had its own “well-funded and built out warehouse strategy” and the Daventry site was not purpose-built to handle online shopping orders.Administrators at Deloitte have asked Asos to consider keeping open Topshop’s flagship Oxford Street store, though Beighton said he would only be interested in a third-party partnership, rather than adopting the lease or buying the site entirely.“It’s not our core model to take stores, nor our core strategy, but never say never. So, since we were presented with opportunity we said we’d have a look, but it’s not our number one priority or focus right now,” he said.The online retailer, which confirmed last week it was in exclusive negotiations with Arcadia’s administrators after the  first revealed the talks, will complete the takeover by Thursday.The changeover is expected to take place on Wednesday night, with customers likely to be greeted with a webpage redirecting them to the Asos site, which will start incorporating the new brands into its own online platform.  Beighton said he was “extremely proud” of the deal.“The acquisition of these iconic British brands is a hugely exciting moment for Asos and our customers and will help accelerate our multibrand platform strategy,” he said. “We have been central to driving their recent growth online and, under our ownership, we will develop them further, using our design, marketing, technology and logistics expertise, and working closely with key strategic retail partners in the UK and around the world.”Meanwhile, affected workers commented on Twitter, with one saying they had worked for Topshop for two years but that their manager only heard their jobs were at risk through news reports on Monday. “It’s actually disgusting … the administrators didn’t inform us, the presssocial media knew before we did. Disappointed isn’t the word today,” they said.Asos is believed to have beaten other potential bidders including the Chinese fashion retailer Shein, Authentic Brands, the US owner of the Barneys department store – which was linked to a joint bid with JD Sports – and the billionaire Issa brothers, who in October announced they were buying Asda for £6.8bn.Online group Boohoo confirmed last week it had entered into exclusive talks to buy the final three Arcadia brands, Wallis, Dorothy Perkins and Burton. Evans, its plus-size clothing brand, was sold to Australian retailer City Chic Collective for £23m in December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d8f6485298eaf601a8cd53688e97d24aa5784cc/0_0_3681_2209/master/3681.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b651b227b2721031aeaa9574caa1d7ec","title":"silver price squeeze reddit traders gamestop ftse dow uk factories business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsTrading app RobinHood has relaxed its restrictions on purchasing GameStop shares.CNBC points out that other restrictions have been lifted too:Clients can buy 75 shares of AMC, higher than the earlier restriction of just 10 shares. Robinhood clients can now buy 200 shares of Express, instead of the previous cap of 20 shares. However, if a clients owns more than 200 shares of Express, they cannot buy anymore shares of the embattled retailer. Those trading restrictions on a range of shorted stocks, imposed due to ‘market volatility’ last week, sparked a huge outcry, and claims that RobinHood was bowing to pressure to protect major hedge funds.But RobinHood has blamed the ‘plumbing’ in the financial system, which meant it was forced to stump up more capital to cover the trades made by its users as prices soared last week. That’s because clearinghouses use a volatility multiplier to work out how much capital is needed which can also go up based on how much of one stock a firm’s customers holds. Back on Friday, RobinHood explained that:The amount required by clearinghouses to cover the settlement period of some securities rose tremendously this week. How much? To put it in perspective, this week alone, our clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements related to equities increased ten-fold. And that’s what led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of securities that the clearinghouses had raised their deposit requirements on. It was not because we wanted to stop people from buying these stocks. We did this because the required amount we had to deposit with the clearinghouse was so large—with inidual volatile securities accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in deposit requirements—that we had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile securities to ensure we could comfortably meet our requirements. Bloomberg is reporting that hedge funds have cut some of their short bets against GameStop, having incurred hefty losses during last week’s short squeeze.After absorbing a $20 billion hit, bears appear to have started covering their GameStop Corp. positions in earnest.“Short squeezes can only last as long as there is a large short position in a stock. Once that dissipates, the situation changes completely,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak \u0026amp Co.Reuters is also reporting that some short sellers covered their bets against Gamestop, adding that the video game retailer remained “a highly shorted stock”.GameStop had 27.13 million shares shorted, down 35 million over the prior week, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.GameStop shares have dropped, as the gripping tussle between hedge funds and Wall Street Bets’ army of small investors resumes.But, that’s still sharply higher than before the short squeeze began in earnest (GME were trading below $20 at the start of the year)Silver, meanwhile, is holding most of its gains:The US stock market has opened higher, as shares recover from last week’s sharp falls.Bloomberg also points out that a short squeeze in silver is hard to pull off.For one, the scope for a short squeeze in silver is far less obvious: money managers have had a net-long position on the metal since mid-2019, futures and options data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.The market for silver is also by some measures much deeper than those for smaller stocks like GameStop. The bricks-and-mortar video game retailer had a market capitalization of about $1.4 billion in mid-January, before the Reddit frenzy sent the company’s value soaring more than 16-fold.By contrast, London vaults held 1.08 billion ounces of silver at the end of November, according to LBMA data. That’s worth almost $32 billion at current prices.What’s more, it’s unclear how long retail investors will stick to the silver trade. Already some prominent members of the WallStreetBets forum have advised against it, with some noting that Ken Griffin’s Citadel Advisors LLC, a favorite bogeyman of the Reddit crowd, is listed as one of the biggest shareholders of the iShares silver trust.Neil Wilson of Markets suggests that large investors may also be driving the silver price rally, rather than it simply being caused by retail traders.He also warns that such speculation is risky, and usually ends badly for some of those who get caught up: The fact that such a large and liquid market as silver can be targeted by retail investors says much about the shift we are witnessing, though despite appearances this morning it’s going to a lot harder to squeeze silver shorts as the market is so much deeper and more liquid.We should also note that some bigger smart money may have be front-running this trade to piggyback the rally and further fuelling the move up. (George Soros: “When I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy, adding fuel to the fire.”)Targeting physically backed ETFs like SLV may be smart, as it will drive physical demand and push up spot prices perhaps more acutely than just by trading futures. I would reiterate that this kind of herding to coordinate a squeeze up is risky and likely to create a bubble that will hurt more than helps on the way down. Whether GameStop or silver, these are purely speculative bubbles that rely on the Greater Fool to keep it going. Examples of these manias litter the history of financial markets: it’s just the same, only in a different wrapping.Allianz’s Mohamed El-Erian has tweeted that GameStop and silver are not the same kind of short squeeze trade (as some WallStreetBets posts have also been pointing out). El-Erian also cautions that the silver squeeze could undermine the squeeze on hedge funds who shorted GameStop’s shares, as the GME trade depends on keeping retail investors on board (rather than selling to the hedge funds).Another post currently high on rWallStreetBets is also warning against trying to engineer a short squeeze in silver to drive the price up.Titled “There is no silver short squeeze happening. NONE. NEVER.”, it argues that:Silver might go up nicely and for a time but don’t get high on hopium, this is not gonna got in the 100s.The post outlines the famous attempt to corner the silver market over 40 years ago by the Hunt brothers (sons of Texas oil billionaire Haroldson Lafayette Hunt Jr). Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt managed to control billions of dollars of silver, driving the price higher and higher, but came unstuck when regulators tightened up the use of leverage to buy silver. The price promptly crashed on Silver Thursday, and the Hunts were hit with huge margin calls on their silver futures contracts. They later declared personal bankruptcy, and were fined and banned from trading in the American commodities markets.David Jones, chief market strategist at Capital, makes an important point. WallStreetBets traders may not be pushing silver up (given those concerns about hedge fund manipulation flagged earlier), but the suggestion that they are could be enough to move silver....Media news: The New European, the weekly title launched five years ago to battle Brexit, has been bought by a consortium of investors including ex-BBC director general and New York Times chief Mark Thompson and Lionel Barber, the former editor of the Financial Times.A group of around 10 investors are backing a management buyout of The New European from Norwich-based publisher Archant, which was bought by private equity group Rcapital Partners last year.Matt Kelly, who launched the title and led the fundraising, will majority own and run the title as chief executive and editor-in-chief. Gavin O’Reilly, former chief of the previous owner of The Independent, will take the role of executive chairman and is also an investor. Other backers include TransferWise founder Taavet Hinrikus, Robin Klein, founding partner at LocalGlobe, Balderton Capital founder Barry Maloney and Jeff Henry, the former ITV executive who gave The New European the green light when he ran Archant. The title, which costs £3 per issue in print, was launched immediately after the Brexit referendum in 2016 as a pop-up publication on a shoe-string budget designed to give Remain supporters a voice. Its editor-at-large is Alistair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former communications director. Post-Brexit it remains a permanent publication with a combined weekly and online circulation of around 20,000, with 2m page views monthly. “Since the Referendum, The New European has shown that there is a significant market for high-quality, informative, provocative and entertaining journalism written for an audience who care deeply about both Britain and Europe’s future.“With new investment capital in place and seasoned media investors, we have a very clear vision of how we can better enhance the experience for our readers and employ new innovations and product developments.”The title, which has consistently made a small annual profit, is expected to make a loss this year but is projected to return to profit next year. Investors in China also drove up silver prices today, Reuters reports:“Since last week’s Reddit discussions to buy long, funds have flowed into the silver market,” said Xu Ying, precious metals senior analyst at Orient Securities Research.“In the short term, silver’s rise has little to do with fundamentals. Sentiment to go long is high, the market rally is not over yet.”Silver is dubbed the “poor man’s gold”, as it is cheaper to buy and invest in while impacted by the same factors as gold.Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades, says silver’s gains are ‘startling’. Fear, however, is pushing many of the traders who have shorts on silver to start covering their positions. Sellers of the physical metal are also rushing to cover their short positions, to avoid finding themselves at a loss in the face of the startling increases.We must also stress, however, that a successful attack on the commodity sector could trigger an intervention by central banks in the medium term to avoid dangerous inflationary spirals.Adrian Ash, director of research at physical trading platform BullionVault, says the surge in silver in the last few days is quite remarkable: “The flood of new interest in silver has emptied coin shops, but there’s plenty of metal in wholesale storage, and any talk of a ‘shortage’ will in truth refer more to trucking and handling capacity rather than physical stockpiles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9e9e4b80acd7d2650dbdd52a9b3490d05d7e01a/0_428_6423_3854/master/6423.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=57aeb413a5b347339770de5a184ac50e","title":"joe biden climate change action","story":"Analysis: The new president has framed the challenge of global heating as an opportunity for US jobs, saying: ‘We have to be bold’For a landmark moment in the global effort to stave off catastrophic climate change, Joe Biden’s “climate day” at the White House was rather low-key. The US president bumped elbows with his newly appointed climate tsar, John Kerry, who he called his “best buddy”, then gave a short speech before perfunctorily signing a small stack of executive orders, donning his mask and striding out without taking any questions.The vision laid out in the actions signed by Biden on Wednesday, however, was transformative. A pathway for oil and gas drilling to be banned from public lands. A third of America’s land and ocean protected. The government ditching the combustion engine from its entire vehicle fleet, offering up a future where battery-powered trucks deliver America’s mail and electric tanks are operated by the US military.Biden may eschew the politically contentious framing of the Green New Deal but there was even an echo of the original New Deal with his plan for a civilian climate corps to restore public lands and waterways. “The whole approach is classic Biden working-class values, putting people to work,” said Tim Profeta, an environmental policy expert at Duke University.The dizzying list of actions demonstrated the breadth and depth of the climate crisis. Biden’s administration will spur new climate-friendly policies for farmers while also devoting resources to the urban communities, typically low-income people of color, disproportionally blighted by pollution from nearby highways and power plants. In all, 21 federal agencies will be part of a new, overarching climate body. “This isn’t time for small measures,” Biden said. “We need to be bold.”“It truly is a new day for climate action,” said Carol Browner, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton. “President Joe Biden is taking unprecedented actions and sending an unmistakable message to the world that the United States is back and serious about tackling the climate crisis.”Biden is yanking every possible governmental lever, it seems, to lower emissions but is also cognizant of attacks from Republicans, and unease among some unions, that ditching projects such as the Keystone XL oil pipeline will kill jobs. Battle lines have already formed – Republicans are trying to prevent any halt to drilling, with Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, vowing to “protect the oil and gas industry from any type of hostile attack launched from Washington DC”.The counter to this backlash will be framed around jobs. Those who know Biden say the president views the climate crisis as a destabilizing threat to American might and national security but also an opportunity to create employment in a Covid-ravaged economy. “When I think of climate change I think of jobs,” has become a Biden slogan.The president argues a $2tn clean energy plan will bring millions of new jobs by refashioning the power grid to run on carbon-free sources such as solar and wind within 15 years, building a new generation of energy-efficient homes and electric cars and mopping up pollution from oil and gas wells. “People have been in pain long enough,” said Gina McCarthy, Biden’s new domestic climate adviser, in reference to the pandemic. “We are not going to ask for sacrifice. If we fail to win the heart of middle America, we will lose.”But emissions won’t get to zero via presidential action alone and Democrats’ hopes of sweeping climate legislation appear remote in a finely balanced Senate where climate denialism is still rife, as demonstrated on Tuesday by the Republican senator Rand Paul promoting a baseless theory that global heating is caused by the Earth’s tilt rather than human activity. Joe Manchin, a key Democratic vote who represents the coal heartland of West Virginia, once shot a climate bill with a rifle in a TV campaign advertisement.“Congress seems to be the last bastion of climate denialism left in America,” said Todd Stern, the lead US negotiator of the Paris climate agreement.There will probably be bipartisan agreement in certain areas, such as tax breaks for wind and solar and upgrades to ageing infrastructure that is being increasingly battered by floods, storms and wildfires. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, is confident some climate spending can sneak into overall budget bills. Biden could do more unilaterally if he declared a state of emergency over climate, Schumer has suggested. “Trump used this emergency for a stupid wall, which wasn’t an emergency. But if there ever was an emergency, climate is one,” the New York senator said last week.The Trump years may well have been the death rattle of influential denialism. The American public’s concern over the climate crisis is at record levels, with even a majority of Republican voters supporting government intervention in the wake of a year of unprecedented wildfires and hurricanes that cost hundreds of lives and tens of billions of dollars. The question is now whether the US is able to change quickly enough to avert further disaster, rather than if it will change at all.“We are already spending the money, folks,” Kerry, the former secretary of state who is now Biden’s climate envoy, said of the recent climate-fueled disasters. “It’s cheaper to deal with the crisis of climate than to ignore it. This is life or death, a challenge to the fibre of our society. The stakes on climate change couldn’t be any higher than they are now. Failure is literally not an option.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1598e1d48e20c766deb7a6f39bb31f3fb9786d9/0_412_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d45cab09507db11881748f8f64b8258","title":"bat boxes greened streets and insect hotels barcelona embraces its wild side aoe","story":"The spring lockdown brought butterflies and bioersity to the Spanish city, and inspired a reimagining of its relationship with natureWhen Barcelona’s inhabitants emerged from a six-week lockdown at the end of April last year, they found that while the city had lain dormant, nature had been busy transforming the streets and parks into a bucolic wilderness.“The parks were shut, so there was no pressure on them from humans or dogs and no gardening was carried out,” says Margarita Parés, who heads the city’s bioersity programme.“It was spring and it rained a lot more than usual. The result was an explosion in plant growth, so there were more insects and more food for birds. And there were many more butterflies, as they are a species that reacts very quickly to changes in the environment.”Once the gardeners went back to work, the question was whether to return everything to its neat and tidy state, or let nature take its course?The answer is neither. Parés says the council spent the previous two years working on plans to “naturalise” or rewild the city – and was about to announce this change of policy when the pandemic struck. By the time the lockdown ended, it was a lot easier to sell rewilding to a public craving fresh air and open spaces.The city is now in the process of creating 783,300 sq metres of green open space, including an area around the landmark Sagrada Familía basilica, and 49,000 sq metres of “greened” streets.The city is also encouraging bird and insect life with around 200 nesting towers for birds and bats, 40 beehives and around 80 plantings designed specifically as insect “hotels”. The council has also published a bioersity atlas listing all the city’s flora and fauna.When it comes to embracing nature in its cities, Spain lags behind many countries. But it is hoped that Barcelona’s new policy will go some way to rectifying that.“In a city like Barcelona, it’s a case of replacing what exists with green infrastructure,” says Lorena Escuer, who runs Hydrobiology, a natural pest control company, and has worked in Barcelona on a pilot scheme called Alcorques Vivos, which plants wildflowers at the base of trees in the streets rather than surrounding them with pavement or grating.“It’s not just having a park surrounded by asphalt but introducing nature into the city,” she says. “People need re-educating. Their idea of a clean space is somewhere where there’s no life, where the ecosystem is dead. There’s this idea that nature is something outside and that what’s natural for the city is for there to be nothing.”Francisco Bergua, president of the Spanish Association of Parks and Public Gardens (AEPJP), says it is important for people to see that rewilding is not just a policy of negligence. “No one looks at a flower growing in a stone wall in the mountains as something ugly but the same flower growing in a city wall is seen as a sign of neglect,” he says.Barcelona is unusual among Spanish cities in that it has its own parks department whereas most local authorities contract work out. As a result, in most urban areas the work is seen essentially as cleaning and maintenance rather than nature conservation.“Some people believe that rewilding is an excuse for local authorities not to carry out maintenance and cut jobs, but they’re mistaken,” says Escuer. “These spaces need to be managed but not in the traditional way, which means gardeners have to be re-educated too.”“Naturalising the city isn’t the same as making it a wild space,” says Bergua. “But instead of parks and gardens we need to think in terms of green infrastructure. Doing the same thing in a different way.”Parés says the new approach to gardening should be understood in the context of the city’s commitment to conserving bioersity with a policy that saves water, energy, material and money, and is more sustainable.She adds that there are plans to dig up areas of asphalt in order to make the city greener, but in a city as dense as Barcelona the other option is to go up. Architect Sergio Carratalá and his MataAlta Studio have created a roof garden on an unusually large 19th-century block situated near the old port. Carratalá, who sees rewilding as a form of deconstructing the built environment, has planted the roof with 10,000 native perennials that are pollinator friendly and drought resistant, to provide flowers all year round as well as feeding and nesting places for birds.Rainwater is collected in tanks and the garden is irrigated with pumps driven by solar panels on the roof. When the scheme is complete, it will provide a vibrant slice of nature for the building’s more than 200 residents.Carratalá says Covid has forced us to look at nature in a different way. “It’s made us look at how we live and how we want to live,” he says. “There’s no going back from here.”Bergua agrees. “The lockdown gave us a glimpse of nature in the city and we liked it.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96c346c9a5d88b4cade415547695dafc9db4a4c5/0_1200_8000_4800/master/8000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=2a43523365b7bedc4596e4b741c4fe9c","title":"spurs nouveau newcastle plus racism on social media football weekly","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Marcus Bean and Jonathan Wilson to discuss a full slate of Premier League fixtures, plus Troy Townsend talks about a number of racist attacks on players in the last weekRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Luckily, it’s easy to boost your hydration levels with these quick fixesAlong with temperatures sneaking to frosty lows and an optimistic to-do list for the months ahead, January tends to arrive with a clutch of familiar niggles dull, dehydrated skin, sporadic breakouts and flaky patches, not to mention a general lethargy that can seep from the brain to the body. Sound familiar?But for a truly solid hydration routine, it’s important we don’t stop at the external. Water, after all, is crucial fuel for the whole body, not just a glowy complexion. Muscles can cramp up when we teeter towards dehydration – water keeps clicky knees at bay by ensuring joints stay lubricated and flexible, while the kidneys need plenty of it to remove toxins from our bodies.Optimum water levels also help our mental health studies show that even mild dehydration can dampen moods, increase irritability, make focusing on tasks far trickier, and leave our motivation for just about anything seriously flagging. So if your hydration routine is somewhat lacking, these easy tips can deliver the boost you need …Drink eight glasses of waterNothing beats getting your hydration straight from the source. Official advice recommends we drink six to eight glasses (around two litres) of water a day, sipping on small amounts often. You can take it one step further by opting for electrolyte-infused drinks such as coconut water or watermelon juice, which are natural sources of minerals including sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium.Helping to regulate the fluid balance in your body, electrolytes are essential for sparking healthy cell function and are thought to help speed up recovery after exercising too, particularly if you’ve gone all-out during a sweaty session.Look to smart skincareJust as certain foods deliver key hydration from the inside, smart skincare powered by ingredients that draw in moisture and protect your skin’s natural moisture barrier can work wonders on the outside. “Skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace. Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearances of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin,” says Psomadakis. “Key ingredients to look for are glycerin and hyaluronic acid.”Vichy Minéral 89 Hyaluronic Acid Hydration Booster, aptly described by beauty editor Funmi Fetto as “a glass of water for your skin”, combines both of these hydrators with the brand’s signature mineralising water to plump up tired skin and protect its barrier function.Calm your mindOur state of mind can have wide-reaching effects on the body, and during bouts of stress or anxiety our skin – the body’s largest organ – can bear the brunt of it. Hormones such as cortisol, which increase in the body when we’re stressed, can lead to inflammation, and flare conditions such as acne, eczema and psoriasis. They have also been shown to impair our skin barrier and increase transepidermal water loss (when moisture is lost through our skin). Daily mindfulness and meditation can help to break the cycle if you’re feeling overwhelmed. Try it with the meditation experts at Headspace, who are currently offering three months of free membership with every Vichy Minéral 89 purchase made on lookfantastic*. “With as little as three minutes practice a day, people can experience the benefits of science-backed meditation, helping the mind to be calmer, clearer, kinder, and more resilient,” says Eve Lewis, director of meditation at Headspace.Prioritise beauty sleepDuring sleep the body repairs itself and replenishes moisture levels in the skin. But studies show that about a third of us don’t get the recommended seven hours of sleep each night. “There is actually some scientific basis to the concept of beauty sleep,” says Psomadakis. “Sleep deprivation leads to increased production of stress hormones and decreased production of antioxidants. This imbalance impairs our skin’s natural defences against external aggressors. This can contribute to loss of hydration, also known as transepidermal water loss, making moisturising all the more essential.”Creating a relaxing bedtime routine can help your mind to switch off before sleep, making good quality rest easier to come by. Try avoiding electronic devices for an hour before bedtime, enjoy an evening meditation to clear your mind, or incorporate a few minutes of relaxing massage into your skincare routine with a hydrating serum to replenish tired skin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83c68fbc4deec8ac240e4d1a6b7c849e611f775b/549_163_1663_998/master/1663.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=af8ecfb1575f7cebaf69b855ecbca7d6","title":"conversations with kids about coronavirus podcast","story":"Children across the UK talk about how the pandemic has affected their livesAnushka Asthana talks to children across the country about what life has been like under lockdown.

Aryan is at home again, which means “loads of sheets of papers to print off” for home schooling, and he says he can’t wait to see his friends again.

But making the adjustment can be difficult without the proper tools and supportSince the coronavirus crisis began, many of us have adjusted to a hybrid work life that combines working from home with time in the office. But combining these two different styles of working can be a challenge, and employees and employers each have important roles to play to ease the transitions and dispel some common misunderstandings about how to be effective in a rapidly evolving working environment.Below are some of the popular misconceptions about hybrid working that may be ready for retirement.Hybrid working inhibits an organisation’s responsivenessIn fact, businesses have been able to be highly responsive to changes – for instance, when the pandemic’s second lockdown began, businesses were able to shift their workforces back to a work-from-home paradigm with relative ease. Hybrid work arrangements, moreover, allow companies to potentially shift the weight of their workforces in either direction – either toward more remote or more in-office hours – as needed as the pandemic and public policy play out.Organisations have also been quick to respond to new health and safety requirements to keep customers safe – with retailers pivoting to online and click and collect models, even if this wasn’t a core channel for them before. Aldi supermarket, for example, changed its business model to offer online deliveries in response to customers needing to isolate this year. The new service meant it could retain customers, rather than see them going elsewhere.Hybrid working diminishes company culture While it’s obviously harder to foster a shared workplace culture, many companies have found ways to strengthen professional bonds among team members through virtual social events and other activities. ServiceNow, the leading digital workflow company, has offered wellbeing activities to employees, their families and friends, including fitness events, engagement exercises that allow employees to share news and achievements, and an allowance that tangibly boosts an employee’s wellbeing.A culture of innovation should be accessible to employees regardless of where they are working, says Nerys Mutlow, innovation evangelist at ServiceNow, and companies should make a point of demonstrating and sharing how iniduals are being innovative while working remotely, which reinforces culture irrespective of physical location.The hybrid work model impedes mental health and wellness Many companies have been implementing mental health-focused support strategies. “We are mindful that the pandemic has taken its toll on people’s mental health and wellbeing,” says Susanna Yallop, chief people officer at Starling Bank. At the start of lockdown, for instance, the bank launched an internal employee initiative, called Never Home Alone, focused on mind, body, nutrition and personal development, through a series of online events and workshops. Ensuring support is in place and having a holistic approach to health, coupled with the increasing flexibility of hybrid working, can only improve mental health moving forwards.It reinforces outdated gender norms The many reports that working from home has turned back the clock on gender roles, because it leaves women to manage the bulk of childcare and housework, must be taken seriously. But as more working parents negotiate the proper balance of work and parenting, there is also more evidence that fathers are rising to the challenge. For instance, Mutlow says, she’s observed a noticeable increase in dads at school gates, which is an encouraging sign that more couples are challenging traditional stereotypes while providing healthy role models for children.Hybrid working is a waste of office spaceTop architects and designers are already well on their way to creating the post-pandemic office, including new models of desk density, ventilation and common work spaces. The changes will require getting used to, of course, but with change comes innovation, and, in the future, office space may be better used for creative collaborations and knowledge sharing.Hybrid working requires complex technologyThe Covid era has accelerated the demand for technology and collaboration tools that increase productivity, engagement and customer relationships. The digital workflows platform provided by ServiceNow, for instance, has shown that digitising processes makes employees’ jobs easier, which leads to higher levels of workforce engagement and productivity. Those digital innovations have also enhanced the safety of the office environment. Mutlow says: “We’ve created applications to manage the workplace environment safely and we ensure we educate and disseminate the information about what is needed before going into the office, so employees are mentally prepared about what to expect.” For instance, ServiceNow has built a suite of return-to-work applications that enable employees to check-in on their mobile the day before coming into the office and tell employers if they have any symptoms, and book a desk.“It’s important,” Mutlow adds, “that when people do return to the office that they know it’s safe.”ServiceNow gives you the power to make work, work better – no matter the circumstances. So employees can be productive, wherever they are.

Contact-tracing resources will be focused on areas where the testing is carried out.It states that all adults in affected postcode areas within those boroughs will be urged to get a PCR swab test and public health officials will start going door-to-door this week.The eight postcode areas are W7, N17 and CR4 in London, WS2 in Walsall, ME15 in Kent, EN10 in Hertfordshire, GU21 in Surrey and PR9 in Lancashire.It means public health officials will seek to test 80,000 adults either door-to-door or through additional mobile testing units that Public Health England said will be deployed. Positive tests will be sequenced for their genetic markers to track any further variations.The 11 cases in the eight areas were discovered with no link to travel from South Africa and are likely to be second or third generation infections from cases originating from South Africa, public health officials believe. It brings to 105 the number of cases of the variant found so far in England. There is as yet no firm research on the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine against the variant, although work is under way to establish that.Officials want to use the tests to break chains of community transmission in a way that it was too late to do with the UK variant that spread from Kent before Christmas. Surrey Local Resilience Forum, Public Health England and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said they would carry out “surge testing”, in which residents in the Goldsworth Park and St Johns areas of Woking would be visited and requested to take a PCR test regardless of symptoms.Ruth Hutchinson, the director of public health for Surrey, said: “This is a precautionary measure – the more cases of the variant we find, the better chance we have at stopping it from spreading further. By playing your part and taking the test, you’ll be helping to keep your community and your loved ones safe.“It’s really important to say that there is currently no evidence that this variant causes more severe illness, so you don’t need to worry.”The area affected in Hertfordshire is the EN10 postcode, which is Broxbourne. Authorities there are also planning systematic waste water sampling to determine how widespread the South African variant is.The briefing states: “There is currently no evidence that this variant causes more severe illness, or that the regulated vaccine would not protect against it. Virus variation and mutation occurs naturally. The more we suppress new variants the more we will avoid variants which cause problems for treatment or vaccination.”The South African variant, like the UK variant, may be more transmissible than the original form of coronavirus but health officials stressed there was no evidence it is more transmissible or dangerous than the UK variant.Door-to-door testing is set to start in Hertfordshire on Thursday. It has previously been used by authorities in high-infection areas such as the London borough of Redbridge, Leicester and Oldham.Dr Alison Barnett, a regional director at Public Health England South East, said: “The UK has one of the best genomic systems in the world, which has allowed us to detect the variant originating in South Africa here in Surrey. I urge everyone offered a test to take it up to help us to monitor the virus in our communities and to help suppress and control the spread of this variant.“The most important thing is that people continue to follow the guidance that is in place: limit your number of contacts, wash your hands regularly and thoroughly, keep your distance and cover your face. If you test positive by any method, you must isolate to stop the spread of the virus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db37fffaec645c7c578a713d3e4ad53e61faa6e0/0_219_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0bc5fb18584bd0a16a7658d532e34c8c","title":"two london clinics mistakenly offer covid jab young people","story":"Admin and computer errors blamed as healthy patients in 20s and 30s receive inviteTwo London clinics have blamed administration and computer errors for accidentally offering the Covid-19 vaccine to young, healthy people.A patient from one clinic in Tower Hamlets got in touch with the  to express their “disbelief” at being invited for a vaccine, along with a flatmate, despite being in their 30s and not classed as extremely clinically vulnerable.Both phoned their GP to check it was not a mistake and say they were told the invitation was legitimate and that they were free to book, which they then did. Each received the vaccine last week at the Cable Street surgery in Limehouse.“We were in disbelief. Both healthy and in our 30s. I called the GP to check this was legitimate – we thought surely it was an admin error. When I got through the receptionist said I wasn’t the first person to call and she would check and confirmed it was legitimate,” said one patient.“Of course I am extremely grateful to be in this position but it does feel a little under the table given the over-70s and vulnerable I know still waiting in other parts of the country,” they added.In England, only four groups of people are currently eligible for the vaccine: those over 70, care home residents, health and social care workers, and the extremely clinically vulnerable.The government’s joint committee on vaccination and immunisation has published a list of groups of people who will be prioritised to receive a vaccine for Covid-19 in the UK. The list is:1 All those 80 years of age and over and health and social care workers.2 All those 75 and over.3 All those 70 and over.4 All those 65 and over.5 Adults under 65 at high at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.6 Adults under 65 at moderate risk of at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.7 All those 60 and over.8 All those 55 and over.9 All those 50 and over.10 Rest of the population.But in the west London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, about 100 young people were erroneously offered the vaccine, the  understands. None actually received it.Another  reader got in touch to say their 22-year-old daughter was invited to book her first vaccination from her GP at Hammersmith and Fulham. “She called the surgery and they told her that they had already vaccinated everyone in the vulnerable category (which seems hard to believe). She did not attend because she is currently at home in Devon but was told she could come back anytime and book an appointment for the vaccine,” they said.Both clinics confirmed they had invited young people to be vaccinated, but said it was a mistake.In Tower Hamlets, Omar Din, the chief executive of AT Medics, the primary care provider for Cable Street surgery, said: “Recent national changes in the way medical records are coded (moving from Read codes to SNOMED coding) has contributed to some patients being erroneously included in high-risk groups. This only affects a small number of overall patients.“If patients find they are being recalled and are otherwise fit and healthy, we would encourage them to contact their registered GP practice and to have themselves removed from the invited group, to allow those who are currently eligible to be vaccinated first.”In Hammersmith and Fulham, a spokesperson for the North West London Collaboration of clinical commissioning groups said: “We are aware of a small number of cases where an inidual has been invited for a vaccine when they are not part of one of the current priority groups. This has been identified by the practice and all appointments have now been withdrawn with apologies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/725ef133bcea00e9fa0ead72f04ce68cf22a5181/0_39_2000_1529/master/2000.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cadf5534ba39a42976c71e27bb085b56 1010w","title":"coronavirus live news eu wants 70 of adults vaccinated by end of summer israel extends covid lockdown","story":"Dutch minister’s comments come as country says primary schools still to reopen next week experts say easing could cause spike in casesAustria’s easing of lockdown will be accompanied by a tightening of its border controls to prevent arrivals from importing new variants of the coronavirus, Reuters reported chancellor Sebastian Kurz as saying on Monday.Speaking at a news conference on the loosening of the country’s lockdown, Kurz did specify which measures would be taken but mentioned the so-called Brazilian variant, which has not been identified in Austria yet. Austria has announced it will relax its coronavirus lockdown from Monday next week, moving to a nighttime curfew and allowing non-essential shops and schools reopen despite infections remaining above the level that the government would like.Pupils will need a negative test in order to attend face-to-face teaching, with others able to join online, the government said in a statement reported by Reuters, adding that tests will be administered in schools and older pupils’ classes will be split into smaller groups.The nighttime curfew will be in place between 8pm and 6am.Customers will have to wear FFP2 face masks in shops, it added.

There were 145 new admissions to intensive care units, while the total number of ICU patients stood at 2,252.The UK has reported a further 18,607 lab-confirmed coronavirus cases – the lowest daily total of new cases since 15 December, when 18,450 cases were recorded. It brings the total number of cases in the UK to 3,835,783, government figures show.There were a further 406 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, taking the toll to 106,564. This is the lowest figure since 28 December, when there were 357 fatalities recorded.Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, together with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show there have now been 123,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK.South African nurses have called on the government to ensure rural healthcare workers are able to access Covid-19 vaccines as the hard-hit country received its first batch of doses.Nurses in remote areas have reported shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic and there are fears that rural areas will be left behind in the country’s vaccine rollout, the Thomson Reuters Foundation reported.“Healthcare workers’ hands are full as we speak, we are very concerned about overstretching them to breaking point,” said Sibongiseni Delihlazo, spokesman for the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (DENOSA), a union. “It is important to not forget them,” Delihlazo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation over the phone.One million shots of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine will rolled out to healthcare workers in the coming months, with 500,000 more due to arrive in February. The health ministry recently showed there were about 1.25 million health workers to be vaccinated and unions are already calling for more vaccines as each employee will need two doses.In places so remote that they cannot be reached by car, healthcare workers fear limited access to vaccines could worsen difficult working conditions.“Ordinarily those clinics don’t have resources or even water, ablutions are not in good conditions,” said Kedibone Mdolo, the north west acting provincial secretary of DENOSA.“Those nurses out there are forgotten so it will be a test for the (health) department to see how best they will reach them,” she said, adding that officials had given only “general answers” on rural roll-out plans.The Department of Health did not respond to requests for comment, but health minister Zweli Mkhize said recently the “entire country” was being considered in the vaccination scheme.South Africa has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in Africa, with more than 1.4 million cases and over 43,000 deaths to date.Denmark, which has been under a tough lockdown since December, will reopen schools for the youngest children from next week.According to the broadcaster TV2, grades 1 to 4 will be allowed back on 8 February. More details are expected to be given by health and education ministers in a press conference this evening.Spain has received another 400,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine and and 52,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine, its health ministry has announced. These shots will be administered this week.Here’s a round up of the latest developments:Elderly people in Poland will not be given the AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab, the vaccination minister said on Monday, adding that the final call will be made following advice from medical experts.Europe’s medicines regulator approved AstraZenecaOxford University’s jab for over-18s on Friday, according to Reuters, but said there were not yet enough results for people over 55 to determine how effective the vaccine will be.Poland follows similar decisions by Germany and Austria. Although the AstraZeneca trial did not include enough over-65s to offer the same level of confidence of its effectiveness as in younger groups, experts have said that while more data needs to be gathered, “there is no data so far to indicate that the vaccine isn’t effective in people over the age of 65”, adding that the vaccine has a good safety profile and encouraging uptake by older people.“If we are talking about the decision of the medical council, we expect it in the coming days or possibly hours, but it is clear that elderly people will not be vaccinated with this shot,” Michal Dworczyk, the prime minister’s top aide, who has been put in charge of vaccinations, told a news conference. “We are waiting for a clear recommendation from the medical council and then … we will take a decision,” he added.Dworczyk said that teachers could be prioritised in the rollout.Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is “doing well” in his recovery from Covid-19, the country’s interior minister said on Monday.Olga Sanchez added that the president is expected to return to a regular morning news conference next Monday, Reuters reported.López Obrador, 67, announced he had tested positive last Sunday, adding that his symptoms were mild and he was “optimistic” about the diagnosis.The variant of the coronavirus first discovered in the UK caused half of all new Covid-19 infections in the Netherlands by 26 January, Dutch health minister Hugo de Jonge has said.Last week, the country’s health authorities said the new, more transmissible variant was responsible for about a third of all new cases in the Netherlands.The Netherlands’ primary schools and daycare centres will reopen as planned on 8 February, education minister Arie Slob confirmed on Sunday. Secondary schools and after-school clubs will stay shut, Dutch News reported."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4473206.1612200441!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"special education set to partially reopen from february 11th","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Irish National Teachers’ Association (INTO) and Forsa, which represents special needs assistants, met this afternoon following talks with the Department of Education over safety concerns.

Special classes in mainstream chools will reopen from 22nd February, in a similar approach.The move paves the way for the wider reopening of schools over the coming weeks.The Irish National Teachers’ Association (INTO) and Forsa, which represents special needs assistants, met this afternoon following talks with the Department of Education over safety concerns.The leadership of both unions said they were satisfied with progress made on its demands for additional safety and support measures. It follows the collapse of two separate plans to reopen schools last month amid safety concerns among schools staff unions.At the time Minister for Education Norma Foley accused unions of rejecting public health advice that schools were safe environments, while unions insisted the Government move to reopen schools was premature.Over the past fortnight, both unions have been engaged in intenseive talks with the Department over safety issues, Following a special meeting of the INTO’s central executive committee this afternoon, INTO president Mary Magner said revised protocols and plans set out by the Department offer a “proportionate and limited reopening of special education provision, led by public health advice”.“They provide critical protections for our members and deliver a carefully planned, phased return to the classroom for our most vulnerable pupils and their teachers,” she said. “We will continue to monitor the situation on the ground closely both ahead of the reopening and thereafter, to ensure that the weekly testing and tracing reports back up Nphet’s conclusions.” She added: “Over the coming weeks, our attention will turn to the general reopening of all primary schools. Against an improving public health landscape, we believe this is possible. However, the power to make this happen rests with each and every one of us. We must all do what we can to limit our movements and abide by the current restrictions. By working closely together classroom learning can resume in safer schools.”Fórsa’s education ision executive committee also met this afternoon and backed the proposals, which it said hd been developed on the basis of intense engagement with unions, and in the context of a wider phased reopening of primary and post-primary school services. The union said progress had been possible against a backdrop of declining numbers of Covid-19 cases, and the significant improvements in schools safety measures achieved since the first proposal for full reopening was announced in early January.Fórsa said enhanced safety measures had been achieved in a range of areas including PPE, the numbers of people in classrooms, provisions for pregnant and medically-vulnerable special needs assistants (SNAs) and teachers, school transport, childcare supports, remote provision to students whose parents don’t want them to attend school, and school risk assessments.It also said SNAs - who are have recently been designated as ‘essential workers’ - would be among the first 30 per cent of the population to receive Covid vaccinations."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4472860.1612171127!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state exams should proceed with modified papers asti president says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere was a growing expectation ahead of the Cabinet committee on education’s meeting that Leaving Cert students will be offered a choice between sitting their exams in June or being awarded calculated grades. Photograph: iStockThe president of the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI), Ann Piggott, has said that their preference is that State exams should proceed this summer, with modified papers.Ms Piggott told Newstalk Breakfast that modified papers would be fairer since students have missed so many days of school.Modified papers would mean plenty of choice for students to omit certain areas of the curriculum and would not cause “too much anxiety.”Ministers and senior officials will meet on Monday afternoon for crucial talks on the Leaving Certificate, efforts to restart classes for children with special educational needs and the likely timetable for reopening the State’s schools.There was a growing expectation ahead of the Cabinet committee on education’s meeting that Leaving Cert students will be offered a choice between sitting their exams in June or being awarded calculated grades.A final decision could be made at tomorrow’s Cabinet meeting, though sources said it could also be delayed until the end of the week.While the traditional written exam would be the ASTI’s preference, Ms Piggott said, issues could arise if students got to choose between sitting the exam or getting predicted grades.“The problem with a choice like that is there isn’t an equivalence in terms of a choice – they’re two very different paths.“One would involve a grade being given to students, and from our perspective, we would be worried that if a grade is given, does that mean then that motivation is gone? That students would not remain at school in May?“What would teachers do if they’re teaching for the Leaving Cert as well? If the choice is given, you will certainly have a huge cohort of students as well who will choose the traditional exam.“That would make it very difficult for us.”Ms Piggott said she hoped the country was weeks away from a phased return of children to schools. If the number of Covid-19 cases was to drop it would be a starting point.“We would like to know that they would be safe in terms of new variants, we would like risk assessment, we would like contact tracing to continue. But certainly if the numbers are going down, our members are more than ready to go back to school.”Until recently, Minister for Education Norma Foley said it was the Government’s “firm intention” to press ahead with traditional exams. Now, however, the Department of Education is examining “possible alternative options”.Previously undisclosed records of contingency plans examined last year and interviews with key stakeholders this year throw fresh light on some of the options facing decision-makers.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Boards talk the talk on climate and social inequality but don\u0026rsquot actReductions \u0026lsquodo not negate the need for targeted\u0026rsquo action, says environmental bodies"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Government and its agencies finally taking threats of storms seriously"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4473151.1612198148!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ecdc credits ireland with giving double the vaccine doses actually administered","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA health worker prepares a dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine. Photograph: Jack Guez  AFPThe European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) has credited Ireland with administering twice as many Covid-19 vaccines as it actually has.According to the ECDC’s vaccine tracker published earlier today, Ireland leads the way in the EU for vaccine distribution, with over 10 per cent of the population covered.The State has administered 438,006 vaccines to its population, according to the ECDC. It gave the same figure for the number of vaccines distributed to Ireland, and said 100 per cent had been administered.However, this is at least twice the official figure published by Irish authorities. The Department of Health said this morning the number of first dose vaccines administered here was 147,700. Some 13,800 have received an additional second dose. Latest HSE figures show 199,800 doses have been administered - 150,800 first doses and 49,300 second doses.Over 220,000 people have been vaccinated in Northern Ireland, leading to online speculation that its figures had been added to the Republic’s on the vaccine tracker. The online tracker went off line at lunchtime as the errors were pointed out.However the ECDC said it did not include figures from Northern Ireland. It said there appears to have been an issue with the data reported from Ireland which it was in the process of getting corrected. Contacted about its figures, the ECDC said its vaccine tracker strived to give an overview of country efforts, providing data “that is as accurate as possible and as timely as possible”.A spokeswoman said member states upload data at any time, but at least twice a week, and this can lead to “discrepancies” between figures.She said the ECDC was constantly reviewing the quality and completeness of national data to address any possible inconsistency or discrepancy with data published in national reports.“Data are subject to retrospective corrections corrected datasets are released as soon as processing of updated national data has been completed.”The HSE and the Department of Health have also been asked for the number of vaccines distributed here, though officials have said in general doses are administered as soon as they are received.The publication of detailed updates on vaccine rollout figures has been delayed by IT issues, the HSE has said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4473154.1612196630!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland can achieve zero covid without sealing country campaign group","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Anthony Staines, professor in health systems at Dublin City University is one member of the group calling for the adaption of a zero Covid policy. It is not necessary to seal Ireland off from the rest of the world to achieve zero Covid, a campaign group seeking to eliminate the virus from the island has said.On Monday, the Independent Scientific Advocacy Group (ISAG), a multidisciplinary group of scientists, academics, and researchers, launched a public campaign calling on the Government to introduce a zero Covid strategy when dealing with the pandemic.The group said zero Covid did not mean there would be no cases of the virus on the island, but that there would be no cases arising in the community from unknown sources.Speaking at the online launch of the campaign, Prof Anthony Staines, professor in health systems at Dublin City University, said a zero Covid approach is “not about sealing the island off from the outside world”.“Even if it were possible – and it isn’t possible – it would be a very bad idea and it is not required to achieve zero,” he said.Prof Staines said the zero Covid strategy would require staying with “significant restrictions probably for as long as the Government plans right now”, until around the end of April.Following that, it would require controlling the borders, providing fair ways for people living at the borders to live their lives and it means quarantining people coming in from airports.It would also require, Prof Staines said, regional public health units being “pushed” and financed to maximise the tracking and tracing of remaining cases to control outbreaks.“The gain of all of this is we get our economy back to something closer to normal for the vast majority of summer. The alternative is to wait until winter, perhaps November, when vaccination would have reached a level at which the virus is under sufficient control to open up again,” he said.‘Sentinel’ zoneWith regard to the Northern Ireland Border, Julien Mercille, an associate professor in Geography at University College Dublin, acknowledged the border counties were at a “disadvantage”, but said outbreaks could be managed through specific checkpoints and zones.“Wherever there are cases, you need to contain those outbreaks with red zones. We would put Garda checkpoints around and hope it wouldn’t spread anywhere else,” he said.Out side of the red zones would be buffer zones, and then a “sentinel” zone outside of that again, which is where Covid-infection is measured to see if it’s spreading out of the red zone.Mercille said under this plan, trucks and trade will continue with designated truck stops so truckers don’t interact too much with other people when in the South.Aoife McLysaght, a professor of genetics at Trinity College Dublin, said the country can get the Covid numbers down again, but “we need the Government to their part to keep it down” through these measures.Dr Gabriel Scally said the country was at a “crossroads”, adding that the “ true public health border is the shore”.The call for zero Covid has become more popular in recent weeks, particularly among opposition TDs. However, members of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) have expressed scepticism about its feasibility .Prof Philip Nolan, chair of Nphet’s epidemiological modelling advisory group, last week said it was an “utterly false promise” to suggest we could go to Level 0 or Level 1 in the “space of weeks or months”.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan, said zero Covid would be very difficult to apply “in a realistic way in an environment like ours”.Ireland is a small economy dependent on its links with Europe and “we simply couldn’t realistically seal the borders of this country and stop people moving in and out”, Dr Holohan said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4472564.1612131367!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"china s president responds to higgins letter about detained dubliner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael Higgins and Chinese president Xi Jinping in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, December 2014.

His is the first known exit ban imposed by China on an Irish citizen.Mr Higgins wrote to Mr Xi on December 23rd raising humanitarian concerns about the south Co Dublin man, whose family has expressed deep concerns about his deteriorating physical and mental health.According to a spokesman for Mr Higgins, the Chinese leader replied last Friday to the President’s letter suggesting “the relevant authorities on both sides may maintain communication and co-ordination to create conditions for an early and proper solution to the case”.The businessman’s wife, Tara O’Halloran, said last night she was constantly asking the Government and Irish authorities “to make more noise about Richard’s case” but there had been “no line of communication” from the Government to the family about his case.Second anniversaryFebruary 26th will mark the second anniversary of Mr O’Halloran last seeing his family.Details of the exchange between the presidents over Mr O’Halloran’s continued detention come three weeks after the father of four from Foxrock was denied entry on to a flight home from Shanghai after being told his exit ban had been lifted.Mr O’Halloran, a relative of former Fine Gael taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, was told by police during an interrogation three weeks ago that the ban had been lifted but he was escorted out of the airport by seven police officers.He travelled to China in February 2019 to try to resolve the affairs of the leasing firm. He has never been charged with any wrongdoing and has testified as a witness several times in the prosecution of Mr Min.Mr O’Halloran was asked during a recent interrogation by the Chinese authorities that he personally repatriate a $36 million (€30 million) payment to China.The Chinese authorities have demanded the return of a leased aircraft owned by the company but Mr O’Halloran’s family have said he is not permitted to do this under Irish law."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4472896.1612177116!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach s st patrick s day visit to us should go ahead coveney says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe tradition of the Irish taoiseach of the day presenting the US president with a bowl of shamrocks on St Patrick’s Day dates back to 1956.

File photograph: EPAMARTIN DIVISEK Aung San Suu Kyi (75) rode to power after a 2015 landslide election win that established Myanmar’s first civilian government in half a century.The daughter of independence hero Aung San, who was assassinated when she was two years old, Suu Kyi spent much of her youth overseas. At Oxford University, she met British academic Michael Aris, who would become her husband. They had two sons and settled in Oxford.In 1988 Suu Kyi returned to Yangon, then the capital, to care for her dying mother. There, she was swept up in student-led protests against the military, which had ruled since a 1962 coup.An eloquent public speaker, Suu Kyi was a likely candidate to lead the movement but the protests were crushed, its leaders killed and jailed, and she was soon imprisoned in her lakeside family home, where she remained until 2010 despite brief releases from house arrest.Suu Kyi made a decision to remain in Myanmar to lead a campaign for democracy. Although the military made it clear she could leave, she feared she would not be allowed to return.She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, which her elder son Alexander collected on her behalf.In August 2011, Suu Kyi had her first meeting with then president Thein Sein, a former general and head of the quasi-civilian administration, marking the start of a pragmatic period of engagement with the government of former soldiers.PowerIn 2015, she came to power on a platform of ending civil war, drumming up foreign investment and reducing the army’s role in politics. Suu Kyi also promised Western allies she would address the plight of the Rohingya Muslim people, forming an advisory commission headed by former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan. A day after Annan’s report was released in August 2017, advising sweeping changes, Rohingya militants attacked security forces in Rakhine State. The military responded with a campaign that included the torching of hundreds of villages and killings, and was described by the UN human rights high commissioner as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.Suu Kyi blamed “terrorists” for an “iceberg of misinformation” about the crisis and said the military was exercising the “rule of law”. In a September 2017 address to the nation, she appeared baffled about the exodus, saying in reference to refugees: “We want to know why they are leaving.”She went to the Hague in 2019 to face charges of genocide brought against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice at the Hague. She acknowledged the possibility war crimes had been committed but framed the crackdown as a legitimate military operation against terrorists.In 2020, a survey by election watchdog the People’s Alliance for Credible Elections, found that 79 per cent of people had trust in Suu Kyi – still beloved as “the Lady” – up from 70 per cent the year before.After a November 2020 parliamentary election, official results show her ruling party, the National League of Democracy (NLD), had won enough parliamentary seats to form the next administration. The NLD said it would seek to form a government of national unity.After weeks of disputes about the election results involving the military, in the early hours of February 1st Suu Kyi, president Win Myint and other senior figures from the ruling party were detained in an early morning raid. – Reuters Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4472928.1612179659!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"japan and south korea take the slow road to covid vaccinations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople take part in a Covid-19 coronavirus vaccination drill at the Kawasaki City College of Nursing on January 27th. Photograph: Philip FongAFP via Getty ImagesJapan’s biggest cities are under a state of emergency as coronavirus deaths rise, even while the country tries to convince the world it can safely hold the summer Olympics.South Korea is prohibiting gatherings of five or more people to keep a recent surge in cases under control. Hong Kong imposed stringent lockdowns on some of its poorest neighbourhoods to stop an uptick.And yet none of these places have begun to carry out the only solution with any hope of putting the pandemic behind them: vaccinations.While the United States and most nations in Europe as well as Asian behemoths China and India have begun inoculating their populations, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong have stood out by proceeding much more slowly.Japan will not even begin to vaccinate medical workers – those at the front of the line – until the end of February. The same is true in South Korea, and those older than 65 will not start receiving inoculations until May. Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous territory of China, will begin vaccinating “high-risk” groups in the middle of February.To a certain extent, the three east Asian economic powerhouses have the luxury of time. Despite recent increases in infections, they have not experienced the kinds of outbreaks that have devastated the United States or Britain. The three governments say that they will approve vaccines after standard regulatory reviews and that they are laying the logistical groundwork for a smooth rollout.“Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong are in the enviable position that their strong application of public health controls and preventions has allowed them to strongly control the disease burden,” said Dr Krishna Udayakumar, director of the Duke Global Health Innovation Center. “So it’s not vaccination or nothing. The countries that are feeling a more urgent need to accelerate vaccinations are those that are suffering most.”OpportunitiesThe delays, which come as more contagious and perhaps deadlier variants of the virus are emerging around the globe, could hamper these governments’ efforts to protect the public and restore normalcy for their weary populations.But postponement also offers opportunities. The laggards can take the time to learn from the troubled rollouts in the United States and Europe, where supply problems, challenges with refrigeration and debates over who to inoculate first have dogged the vaccine campaigns.By moving more deliberately, the east Asian governments may also be able to alleviate some concerns among the public about the remarkable speed with which the vaccines have been created. In Japan and South Korea, polls show that many people are reluctant to get vaccinated right away.“The bottlenecks are really going to be on the demand side,” Udayakumar said. “Can we actually convince people to accept the vaccine and can we roll out implementation quickly enough to reach herd immunity through vaccinations?”Supply, too, may restrain the speed of the rollout. While Hong Kong approved Pfizer’s vaccine in January, neither Japan nor South Korea has approved any yet. Both countries have contracts with multiple vaccine makers for enough doses to cover more than their entire populations. Manufacturers are scrambling to fill these orders and many others.“If vaccines are secured, South Korea will proceed in vaccination quicker than any other countries in the world, and this is what South Korea is good at,” said Kim Woo-joo, an infectious disease specialist at Korea University. “The problem is that it is uncertain and not guaranteed that the vaccines will arrive at the right time.”Olympic GamesIn theory, Japan has a more urgent deadline. The government is insisting that it will proceed with the Olympics despite intensifying questions about the feasibility of doing so. The games, which were originally scheduled for 2020 in Tokyo but postponed to this summer, are scheduled to open on July 23rd.In January, Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, encouraged athletes, Olympic officials and others likely to travel to Tokyo for the games “to get vaccinated in their home countries, in line with national immunisation guidelines, before they go to Japan”.But vaccination will not be required, officials have said. In comments about the Olympics before the Japanese parliament in January, prime minister Yoshihide Suga said that “by taking proper measures against infection, we are preparing to hold a safe and secure tournament without having a vaccine as a prerequisite”.That has spurred worries in Japan that large numbers of unvaccinated people could be arriving this summer. In turn, those travelling to Japan to compete might feel more confident if local residents have been vaccinated in large numbers.Even as these pressures build, there have been signs that the government is lowering expectations for a speedy distribution schedule. This past week, Taro Kono, a cabinet minister appointed to manage coronavirus vaccinations, said that residents older than 65 would not start getting jabs until at least April. Herd immunity would most likely not come until months after the Olympics.Another major potential complication for the Japanese government is a public that has demonstrated among the highest levels of scepticism about vaccines in the world. Misinformation, fuelled by the media, has thwarted earlier campaigns.After the human papillomavirus vaccine to prevent cervical cancer was introduced in Japan in 2010, local media widely reported that some girls who had been inoculated were suffering from side effects that experts later found had no connection to the vaccine.Yet memories of those media reports – however vague – still influence public opinion. Kazuo Inoue (68), a semi-retired consultant in Tokyo, said his attitude was “wait and see”.“Generally, any new vaccine or new medicines have side-effects,” he said. “And we had several cases before. I forgot the name of the vaccine, but it was a vaccine for girls, for HPV, a new one and it had a lot of side effects for many people.”Talk showsErika Yamao (33), a hairstylist and mother of three young children in Tokyo, said she had been watching midday talk shows where celebrity hosts warned about possible side effects of the vaccines. She said she was disinclined to get a shot when it became available.“I don’t know how much it can actually protect me,” Yamao said. “And there are a lot of risks associated with it.” Government advisers say they will have to tread carefully with public health campaigns promoting the vaccines.“I think that just asking people to get the vaccine will be a source of more backlash,” said Takashi Nakano, a professor at Kawasaki Medical School and a member of the health ministry’s advisory board on vaccines.“People may think, ‘Why is he suggesting I take the unsafe vaccine along with the government push?’”In part to assuage domestic concerns, Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have been conducting small clinical trials in Japan in advance of obtaining regulatory approval for their vaccines. Japan has contracts with the three companies and recently announced plans to manufacture doses of the shot developed by AstraZeneca domestically.Given the government push to host the Olympics, officials are particularly concerned about tethering an immunisation campaign to the success of the games.“Vaccination and the Olympics should be separated,” Shunichi Shinkawa, an official in Japan’s Cabinet Secretariat Office for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control, said in an interview. “Vaccination is for the people and to protect human life in Japan.”Even some athletes are wary. Mei Ichinose, a Paralympic swimmer who is competing for Japan and currently training near Brisbane in Australia, said she had been asked if she feared that the vaccine might affect her performance.“Performance aside, I don’t know if I feel 100 per cent safe to get it as just a human being,” she said. “Vaccines usually take a lot of time to be created. But this time, the vaccines were made so quickly, so I worry about their safety.”In other cases, decisions about whether to take the vaccine may just come down to whether it allows people to do something they really want.Yamao, the Tokyo hairdresser, said she would be vaccinated if it meant she could visit her parents in Osaka. “If I can’t ride the bullet train without the vaccine, then I would consider it,” she said. “It’s a last resort.” – New York TimesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4472835.1612190936!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"myanmar coup military announces ministers as suu kyi and other politicians detained","story":"Professor Melissa Crouch, an Australian expert on Myanmar politics, says that there is a lot of confusion and devastation\u0027 in the country, following the military seizing power in a coup against the democratically elected government.

Photograph: STRAFPGetty Images.Myanmar’s ruling junta on Monday announced a purge of Aung San Suu Kyi’s government, removing 24 ministers and deputies and naming 11 replacements in its new administration after seizing power in a coup.The announcement was made on the military-run Myawadday Television and included new appointments in the portfolios for finance, health, information, foreign affairs, defence, borders and interior.Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party earlier urged Myanmar’s people to oppose Monday’s apparent coup and any return to “military dictatorship”.The National League for Democracy (NLD) released a statement on the Facebook page of its party head, Ms Suu Kyi, saying the military’s actions were unjustified and went against the constitution and the will of voters.Myanmar military television said on Monday that the military was taking control of the country for one year, while reports said many of the country’s senior politicians including Ms Suu Kyi had been detained.A presenter on Myawaddy TV announced the takeover and cited a section of the military-drafted constitution that allows the military to take control in times of national emergency.He said the reason for the takeover was in part due to the government’s failure to act on the military’s claims of voter fraud in last November’s election and its failure to postpone the election because of the coronavirus crisis.The announcement and the declaration of a state of emergency follows days of concern about the threat of a military coup – and military denials that it would stage one – and came on the morning the country’s new parliament session was to begin.The takeover is a sharp reversal of the partial yet significant progress toward democracy Myanmar has made in recent years following five decades of military rule and international isolation that began in 1962.It would also be a shocking fall from power for Ms Suu Kyi, who led the democracy struggle despite years under house arrest and and won a Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts.International condemnationThe military’s actions received swift and widespread international condemnation.The White House said US president Joe Biden had been briefed on the detentions.“The United States opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of recent elections or impede Myanmar’s democratic transition, and will take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.The office of the UN secretary-general was also among those to issue a statement condemning the developments as a “serious blow to democratic reforms”.The detention of the politicians and cuts in television signals and communication services on Monday were the first signs that plans to seize power were in motion. Phone and internet access to Naypyitaw was lost and Ms Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party could not be reached. Phone service in other parts of the country was also reported down, though people were still able to use the internet in many areas.The Irrawaddy, an established online news service, reported that Ms Suu Kyi, who as state counsellor is the nation’s top leader, and the country’s president, Win Myint, were both detained in the pre-dawn hours. The news service cited Myo Nyunt, a spokesman for the NLD.Its report said that the party’s Central Executive Committee members, lawmakers and regional cabinet members had also been taken into custody. – APStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: 80,000 people need testing after South African variant spreads - watch live Prince Harry forced to dilute \u0026#39unduly tendentious\u0026#39 attack on media as judge rules he must pay£32,500 costsMonday evening news briefing: South African Covid variant spreads in UKPolitics latest news: No return to tiers after lockdown, Boris Johnson hints - watch Matt Hancock liveComment: Britain should choose vaccine internationalism in the face of EU threatsHuge snowstorm hits US east coast as New York declares state of emergencyPrime Minister ‘optimistic’ about summer holiday chances UK weather: Flood warnings as  January named coldest in a decadeMacron camp clash with Le Pen over border closures as poll sees her closing in on French presidencyBritain buys up vaccine doses for next four yearsComment: TV licence bullying of over-75s is a scandalPrisoner attacked officer after his Xbox was confiscated in wake of terror attackIsle of Man \u0026#39returns to normal\u0026#39 as face masks and social distancing is ditchedWatch: Why Boris Johnson\u0026#39s vaccine roll-out could be a \u0026#39shot in the arm\u0026#39 for his premiershipAfrica’s first major shipment of Covid vaccines due to arrive in South AfricaUrgent children\u0026#39s operations cancelled due to Covid, Royal College of Surgeons warnsEvan Rachel Wood claims she was abused by Marilyn MansonTroubles veterans face new charges months after Boris Johnson vowed end to \u0026#39witch hunt\u0026#39 Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pressure mounts von der leyen shortcomings brutally exposed","story":"Ursula von der Leyen was sitting in her converted flat next to her office in the EU\u0027s palatial HQ in Berlaymont when the phone started ringing.It was Friday evening, around 9.20pm, and on the line was the British Prime Minister.Boris Johnson was demanding to know why the EU had invoked Article 19 of the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol, effectively blocking imports of Covid vaccines through the Irish Republic to the UK.At 9.50pm - about half an hour after the call had concluded - Number 10 issued a damning account of that call, saying that the PM expressed his grave concerns about the potential impact which the steps the EU has taken today on vaccine exports could have.An hour after their call - around 10.30pm London time - Mrs Von der Leyen called back making clear to Mr Johnson that the EU would not disrupt vaccine supplies into the UK.Number 10 stressed there were no raised voices on the calls, but it was a torrid end to what had been a dreadful few days for the EU - days had seen the Commission accused of trying to bully the UK and drugs companies into giving up Britain’s share of precious vaccines.Mr Johnson and his team in London had caught wind of the Commission\u0027s plans earlier last week, but chose to adopt a low key approach, arranging for a call between Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, and his counterpart in Brussels on Wednesday.By Friday morning the talks had gone up a notch and the emerging crisis was discussed at the Prime Minister\u0027s 8.30am meeting in Number 10.Although officials had been gaming what the Commission might do and how the UK would respond the response from the Commission to invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol still came as a shock.Following a meeting between Mr Johnson and his senior officials Number 10 made public the concerns in London, saying they did not expect the EU - a “friend and ally” - would do “anything to disrupt the fulfilment of these contracts.Mr Johnson decided to call Micheal Martin, the Irish Prime Minister, to discuss the Commission\u0027s actions. Again concerns about peace in Northern Ireland were raised and the PM stressed the UK’s enduring commitment to the BelfastGood Friday agreement.Mr Johnson then phoned Mrs von der Leyen.By now the warnings about threats to the Good Friday Agreement had been heard in Washington DC, where sources said the White House was urgently trying to clarify what the move would mean.In the face of such raw anger and growing international concern, Brussels backed down.Just before midnight UK time on Friday Ms Von der Leyen posted a message on Twitter saying she agreed with Mr Johnson not to add restrictions to vaccine exports.It was a week that began very differently. Brussels had been determined to force AstraZeneca to its knees. It ended, however, with the European Union humiliated.Mrs von der Leyen was facing calls to resign on Saturday, and fierce criticism in her home country of Germany.It was after all the Commission President who, having taken personal charge of the AstraZeneca issue, and was now seen to have badly botched the response to the pharmaceutical company’s failure to fulfil EU orders of jabs.By moving to impose a “vaccine border” on the island of Ireland she was seen as having trashed the bloc’s reputation worldwide and sacrificed the moral high ground the Commission had taken over the Irish border during the Brexit negotiations.Her decision to trigger Article 16 of the Brexit treaty’s Northern Irish protocol, achieved the once unimaginable feat of uniting an unimpressed Michel Barnier, Irish prime minister Micheál Martin and Boris Johnson against her.Mrs von der Leyen may have ordered a U-turn late on Friday and blamed the crisis on “an oversight”, but the damage was done.It should have been very different. Brussels had planned for the first AstraZeneca jabs to be rolled out across the bloc once the European Medicines Agency approved the vaccine on Friday.The European Commission, which negotiated the supplies on behalf of the 27 member states, would use the delivery as a symbol of the benefits of EU unity.The inconvenient fact that the EU’s vaccination roll-out was lagging far behind Brexit Britain would soon be forgotten in a flood of up to 400 million jabs enough to vaccinate about half of all EU citizens.The day couldn’t come soon enough for the EU’s heads of state and government, who had decided not to use the emergency authorisation procedures Britain used to fast-track the approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine.Commissioners in Brussels sneered that this was a safer, more responsible route than that taken by Boris Johnson.Many EU governments had chosen not to buy doses of rival vaccines, preferring to wait for the cheaper and easier to store jab from the British-Swedish company.The slower pace was, however, exacting a political price on the bloc’s national leaders.Polls in France showed Marine Le Pen trailing Emmanuel Macron by just 48 to 52 in second round voting intentions for next year’s presidential elections.While the UK has distributed 11.86 jab doses per 100 people, France, where anti-vax beliefs have taken root, has only managed 2.08.European newspapers were reporting that Mr Johnson’s vaccine gamble had paid off, which they said was a source of great frustration to the French.Perhaps that is what motivated Mr Macron to trash the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying it was almost ineffective for those over 65, and some say over 60.The cynical ploy came on Friday, the same day that the European Medicines Authority approved the vaccine for all ages, despite an earlier decision by German regulators to restrict it to the over 65s.The German government was also facing questions about why it was lagging so far behind the UK, US and Israel.The strain was showing elsewhere in Europe as well. The normally docile Dutch erupted into days of rioting, their worst in 40 years.The Italian government was tearing itself apart over the handling of the second coronavirus wave. On Tuesday, Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte resigned as his coalition government collapsed.The pressure was on the European Commission to deliver, which explains the furious reaction after AstraZeneca broke the news that there would be a shortfall in the supply.The company would only be able to deliver a quarter of the jabs promised in the first quarter of the year, it said. There would be about 75 million vaccines missing because of production problems at its Belgian plant.Mrs von der Leyen was determined that the member states would not point the finger of blame for the delays at her commission and so the decision was made to launch a full frontal, and unprecedented, attack on AstraZeneca.Suspicions grew in Brussels that AstraZeneca may have sold reserved EU vaccine stock to countries such as Britain, which they claimed had paid a higher price for the jab.Despite the fact that AstraZeneca was providing the vaccine at cost price, the story was given legs by the Brussels spin machine. Their message was clear this was not our fault.Diplomats from the EU’s capitals in the Belgian capital began circulating news stories from last year, when the UK signed a deal with AstraZeneca first.AstraZeneca had imported millions of vaccines from its EU plants to compensate for a delay in production of UK supplies of the jab. Perhaps these were jabs meant for the bloc, the anonymous briefers suggested.The commission, which prides itself on its legal expertise and respect for the rule of law,  turned the screws on AstraZeneca, accusing it of breaching its contract with Brussels.Mrs von der Leyen gave Pascal Soriot, the CEO of AstraZeneca, a dressing down in a morning phone call. It was the first of three grillings for the boss, who was summoned to further two video conference meetings with the EU and national officials later that day.Then Stella Kyriakides, the European commissioner for health and food safety, dropped a bombshell. Brussels would introduce an “export transparency mechanism” by the end of the week, Ms Kyriakides said.  Cyprus’s EU commissioner said that manufacturers in the EU would have to ask Brussels for permission before exporting vaccines out of the bloc.The threat of an EU export ban was clear. Britain, less than a month out of the Brexit transition period and expecting almost 3.5 million vaccines from Pfizer’s Belgian plant, was in the firing line.It was the first of many signals that, as far as the commission was concerned, British public opinion of Brussels simply no longer mattered.On Tuesday, AstraZeneca’s CEO hit back. There was no contractual obligation to supply the vaccines beyond an obligation on the company to make “best reasonable efforts” to provide it, he said.The company’s two production plants in Britain could help with the EU supply but, under the terms of the supply contract with the UK, only after a British order of 100 million jabs had been supplied.An infuriated Brussels hit back hard on Wednesday. It demanded that AstraZeneca ert supplies of millions of UK-manufactured vaccines to the bloc and accused Mr Soriot of breaching confidentiality by revealing details of the contract.Ms Kyriakides said the firm had contractual, societal and moral obligations to use all its facilities to make up the shortfall, and that there was no hierarchy of factories.MEPs began to talk of a vaccine trade war unless the pharma company caved to the demands. Meanwhile Mr Johnson was looking like the only adult in the room.On Thursday, Belgian authorities, acting on a European Commission request, raided AstraZeneca’s plant in the French-speaking region in Wallonia.The reason was to see if the company’s explanation of production problems was genuine but another motivation was to keep the pressure on the company.Having secured AstraZeneca’s permission to release a redacted version of its contract with the EU, Mrs von der Leyen had a salvo planned for Friday.After the contract was released, the commission pointed to clauses it claimed supported its arguments.In one, AstraZeneca appeared to confirm that no other agreement would interfere with its supplies. Another clause said that, for the purposes of the deal, the two UK factories should be considered part of the EU.But eyebrows were raised as Mrs von der Leyen had, that very day, said there were no “best endeavours” clauses in the contract. The published deal, which in another sign the wheels were coming off, was accidentally released unredacted. It had those clauses.She either told an intentional lie to 447 million people or she didn\u0027t know what was in her own contract, Germany’s Bild Zeitung said on Saturday.As EU officials demanded Britain publish its contract with the pharma company, there was growing disquiet among some member states the commission was going too far.But despite the warnings of her own trade experts over the triggering of Article 16, Mrs von der Leyen was set on imposing the hard vaccine border on the island of Ireland.Among the voices arguing against the move was Sabine Weyand, the EU’s top official on trade and former deputy Brexit negotiator. She was the woman who designed the Irish border backstop during the Brexit talks, which was ultimately ditched in favour of a regulatory and customs border in the Irish Sea.In an astonishing gaffe, Mrs von der Leyen only informed Ireland she was triggering one of the most sensitive clauses in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement after the announcement.She also did not give notice to Britain about the move, which was meant to prevent Northern Ireland becoming a backdoor entry of vaccine supplies to the UK.Considering that the European Commission had spent the previous four years preaching the importance of open borders and peace on the island of Ireland, as well as criticising any suggestion from Britain of using the clause, it was an astonishing move.It wasn’t long before both the Irish and British prime ministers were on the phone to Mrs von der Leyen, both urging a change of tack.So it was that at 11.45pm local time, about eight hours after the announcement, a statement was released saying that Article 16 , the so-called safeguard clause, would not be triggered after all.What Mrs von der Leyen planned as a show of strength and a reassertion of control had demonstrated anything but.The European press was unforgiving, describing it as the “Brexit own goal” and potentially Mrs von der Leyen’s greatest failure.As one EU diplomat told the : “The pressure on von der Leyen is huge and increasing. This is not a good look.”The question for Britain this weekend is how will Mr Johnson use the moral high ground he has gained in the row over vaccine supplies, perhaps to improve Brexit relations with Brussels?One Government source said: There is a window of opportunity and we want to work together, we want things to get better.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dogs womans best friend new study reveals","story":"While kings, poets and philosophers have repeated the adage ‘dog is a man’s best friend’ a new study argues that it was women who first created the bond between canines and humans thousands of years ago.In one of the first anthropological studies of its kind, researchers at Washington State University revealed that dogs’ relationships with women “might have had a greater impact on the dog-human bond than relationships with men”.  Men may have wanted dogs for hunting or herding livestock but it was women who gave them names and treated them with affection in the way humans do today, they said. “Humans were more likely to regard dogs as a type of person if the dogs had a special relationship with women, the study in the Journal of Ethnobiology found.  Although dogs are one of the oldest and most widespread domesticated animals, very few anthropological studies have directly focused on the human relationship with canines. Anthropologists at the university examined earlier studies on 144 ancient communities from all over the world where there was evidence of dogs being kept. Researchers found thousands of mentions of dogs in the ethnographic documents inside the Human Relations Area files database. In the earliest human settlements where dogs were associated with women, they were given names, allowed to sleep indoors with people and mourned when they died. This bond also allowed the dogs to be more easily trained and thus their \u0027usefulness\u0027 to humans also increased as they were used more for hunting. Conversely, when food production increased, due to advances in crop growing and herding of livestock, the ‘utility’ of the dogs diminished. Jaime Chambers, lead author of the study and PHD student at the university said: “Humans were more likely to regard dogs as a type of person if the dogs had a special relationship with women.“They were more likely to be included in family life, treated as subjects of affection and generally, people had greater regard for them.“We found that dogs’ relationships with women might have had a greater impact on the dog-human bond than relationships with men.” The team also discovered that the warmer the climate the less useful dogs tended to be to humans. Robert Quinlan, a professor of anthropology and co-author of the paper said: “Relative to humans, dogs are really not particularly energy efficient.  “Their body temperature is higher than humans, and just a bit of exercise can make them overheat on a hot day. We saw this trend that they had less utility to humans in warmer environments.” Although there were some exceptions to this with a few dog-loving cultures in the tropics, it was a fairly consistent trend, he added. The findings of the study adds evidence to the evolutionary theory that dogs and humans chose each other, rather than the older theory that humans intentionally sought out wolf pups to raise on their own.  Ms Chambers said: “Dogs are everywhere humans are.  “If we think that dogs are successful as a species if there are lots of them, then they have been able to thrive. They have hitched themselves to us and followed us all over the world. It’s been a very successful relationship.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"myanmar leader aung san suu kyi detained raid","story":"A military coup took place in Myanmar early on Monday as the country\u0027s leader Aung San Suu Kyi was detained in an early morning raid.The army said it had carried out the detentions in response to election fraud, handing power to military chief Min Aung Hlaing and imposing a state of emergency for one year, according to a statement on a military-owned television station. The announcement on military-owned Myawaddy TV followed days of concern about the threat of a military coup and comes as the country\u0027s new Parliament session was to begin.Myo Nyunt, spokesman for the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party, told Reuters by phone that Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other leaders had been taken in the early hours of the morning.Adding that he also expected to be detained, he said: I want to tell our people not to respond rashly and I want them to act according to the law.”He told AFP that  he was extremely worried about the pair. With the situation we see happening now, we have to assume that the military is staging a coup, he said.The Irrawaddy, an established online news service, said that the party\u0027s Central Executive Committee members, lawmakers and regional Cabinet members had also been taken into custody.Soldiers took up positions at city hall in Yangon and mobile internet data and phone services in the NLD stronghold were disrupted, residents said. Internet connectivity also had fallen dramatically, monitoring service NetBlocks said.State-run MRTV television said in a Facebook post that it was unable to broadcast due to technical issues.The NLD said Suu Kyi was calling on the public not to accept the coup by the military and urged them to protest.The actions of the military are actions to put the country back under a dictatorship, the NLD said in a statement which carried leader Suu Kyi\u0027s name.I urge people not to accept this, to respond and wholeheartedly to protest against the coup by the military.The US, Australia and others were concerned by the reports and urged Myanmar\u0027s military to respect the rule of law.The United States is alarmed by reports that the Burmese military has taken steps to undermine the country\u0027s democratic transition, including the arrest of State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian officials in Burma, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a statement from Washington.She said President Joe Biden had been briefed on the reported developments.The United States opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of recent elections or impede Myanmar\u0027s democratic transition, and will take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed, the statement said. Burma is the former name of Myanmar.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne called for the release of Suu Kyi and others reported to be detained. We strongly support the peaceful reconvening of the National Assembly, consistent with the results of the November 2020 general election, she said.Japan said it was watching the situation and currently had no plans to repatriate Japanese nationals from Myanmar.Tension had been rising between the civilian government and the military in Myanmar, with the army describing the recent election as fraudulent.In November Ms Suu Kyi ‘s party offered to form a government of national unity after winning an overall majority in the election.She had approached 39 ethnic minority parties to work with the NLD, which had trounced the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which was backed by the military.According to international observers the vote had gone smoothly without any major irregularities, although this was disputed by the opposition. But polls in some parts of the country were cancelled for “security reasons”, leaving an estimated 1.5 million voters disenfranchised – including hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims.Tension had also been reported in Rakhine state in the west of the country, where clashes between the Rakhine militant group, the Arakan Army and the military is estimated to have displaced  around 200,000 peopleThe party’s win represented a vindication for Ms Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Laureate, who had endured a turbulent first term having restored democracy in a country which had been under military rule for nearly five decades.The party’s spokesman at the time described the win as a “landslide” which had shown the Myanmar people still had faith in Ms Suu Kyi’s leadership.After years under house arrest, Ms Suu Kyi’s release and electoral victory was hailed by human rights groups as bringing an end the military’s grip on the country.She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, while still under house arrest.Ma Suu Kyi was hailed as an outstanding example of the power of the powerless.However her international reputation was severely dented by the country’s treatment of the Rohingya Muslims.It saw the country accused of genocide, an accusation which has been strongly denied by Myanmar.Daniel Russel, the top US diplomat for East Asia under President Barack Obama, who fostered close ties with Suu Kyi, said another military takeover in Myanmar would be a severe blow to democracy in the region.If true, this is a huge setback - not only for democracy in Myanmar, but for U.S. interests. It’s yet another reminder that the extended absence of credible and steady U.S. engagement in the region has emboldened anti-democratic forces, he said.Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at Washington’s Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the situation was a challenge for the new US administration.The US as recently as Friday had joined other nations in urging the military not to move forward on its coup threats. China will stand by Myanmar like it did when the military kicked out the Rohingya,” he said.John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said Myanmar\u0027s military had never submitted to civilian rule and called on the United States and other countries to impose strict and directed economic sanctions on the military leadership and its economic interests.As the news broke, Avinash Paliwal, associate professor in International Relations at SOAS tweeted: “One step side-ways, two steps back.“These last 48-hrs have altered Myanmar’s political trajectory —it was never liberal democratic, even if elections took place— again. And I think this might the be end of Suu Kyi’s pol. journey (hopefully not life).”​More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british troops mali commanded chinese officer emergesas first","story":"British troops are being commanded by a Chinese officer for the first time, it has emerged.The 300 British troops deployed to counter Islamist violence in Mali will work under a Chinese sector commander as part of the United Nations (UN) force.Lieutenant Colonel  Tom Robinson, Commanding Officer of the Light Dragoons, said the Chinese military had provided a hospital to the UN mission and were responsible for protecting the camp which houses the British troops.“I work for a Chinese Brigadier who is sector commander,” Lt Col Robinson said.“He’s a professional guy who I very much enjoy working with.”It is thought to be the first time British forces have been under command of a Chinese officer, although the Royal Navy has worked alongside the Chinese navy in counter-piracy operations around the horn of Africa. The news comes as tension between Britain and China, after human rights abuses in Hong Kong, aggressive Chinese sovereignty claims in the Indo-Pacific and questions over the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic, have soured relations between London and Beijing. The British Taskforce, comprising troops drawn primarily from the Light Dragoons and 2nd Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment, has just successfully completed its first patrol in the West African country. Around 200 soldiers patrolled in 60 vehicles specially designed to handle the harsh desert conditions. The initial deployment saw the troops venture only 30 miles into the countryside, an area largely beyond the reach of the Malian authorities. Future patrols are planned to go much further.   “That was an opportunity for us as the first British troops deployed in Mali to really understand how it is we\u0027re going to operate,” Lt Col Robinson said.“There\u0027s nothing like going out of camp for the first time, testing our vehicles on unfamiliar African scrub, meeting the Malian people and really getting that proper feel for what this country is all about and how we can help.”He said the British patrol had been the first UN peacekeepers encountered by some of the Malian people in the eight years the mission has existed. Writing exclusively for the  in December, the Defence Secretary said it was in the UK’s interests to join the 14,000 UN troops, drawn from 56 countries..“History tells us that extremist groups opposed to our way of life can thrive in the lawless spaces that spring from the absence of governance, Ben Wallace said.The UN force is separate from the French-led counter-insurgency mission also in Mali, which is hunting local Islamist groups in the region affiliated to ISIS and al Qaeda.Britain supports the French mission, called Operation Barkhane, with three Chinook heavy-lift helicopters and around 90 personnel. The two British missions are entirely separate, but senior commanders accept the fighting groups opposed to Malian and Western forces may not see the difference.    “This is a dangerous country and if we were complacent and we were not taking that threat seriously then my command team and I would be failing our soldiers in not keeping that focus on making sure they are doing everything they can to deter and protect themselves from the people who wish to do us harm,” Lt Col Robinson said.Speaking as the troops deployed last month, Major General Nick Borton from the MoD\u0027s Northwood headquarters accepted the mission was dangerous but said it fitted perfectly into Britain\u0027s wider strategy for the region.He also said it was “a chance to drive reform in United Nations peacekeeping operations”, largely seen as expensive and inefficient. The UN mission in Mali started in 2013 and French forces deployed on the separate counter-terrorist operation the following year.

They are taking a lot of risks with their vaccination programme. I can understand that. They have spaced out massively the delay between the two injections, up to 42 days. Our scientists tell us you mustn\u0027t do that, he said.They are relying primarily on one single vaccine, which is AstraZeneca, and the German authority has already said there are doubts about its efficacy for the over 65s. In the UK they\u0027re using it for that group.Therefore I believe that, clearly because they\u0027re in a difficult sanitary situation, they\u0027re taking these extra risks. I don\u0027t think our public would accept that we take all those risks against the advice of our scientists.His comments came after Mr Macron on Friday suggested the AstraZeneca vaccine was quasi-ineffective for the over 65s. He was referring to Germany\u0027s vaccine committee, which last week recommended AstraZeneca should only be given to people under that age, citing a lack of sufficient data from the clinical trials.That sparked an irate reaction from Sir John Bell, a leading member of the team that developed the Oxford AstraZeneca, who said the French president was lashing out to compensate for his country not having adequate supplies of the drug.This statement suggests he has not looked at the clinical or immunogenicity data which shows it is excellent in the over-65s, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme on Saturday. There is ample evidence of strong antibody responses in this age group and you can be certain they will respond to the vaccine. Perhaps he is trying to reduce demand for the vaccine for some reason.Mr Beaune denied France could have secured more vaccine doses by negotiating them nationally rather than collectively.Au contraire, he said, France would have risked falling further behind its neighours had it gone it alone.“I defend tooth and nail the European framework of common purchasing, he said.“Can you image Germany, France and Italy phoning labs to get (vaccine) shipments to the detriment of their neighbour?“Would France come out better (without the EU)?” he asked. “What would people say if the Germans succeeded in having twice as many doses as us? I would remind you that the first vaccine (Pfizer) is US-German and that France has a privileged link with one laboratory Sanofi whose vaccine will arrive very late.“If we had told the French we are waiting for Sanofi at the end of the year and haven’t negotiated with Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca I think we would have made a political and sanitary error.Beyond the EU vaccine row, President Macron\u0027s government is coming under rising domestic criticism for its inability to ramp up vaccinations.According to the respected Covid Tracker website, the country only administered 26,585 doses on Sunday.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland does not need vaccines uk","story":"Ireland will not need excess UK vaccines as a pledged ramp up in EU deliveries will enable the country to meet its inoculation targets, political sources have said.Like many EU member states, the vaccination roll-out has ground to a halt as a supply crunch across the bloc has choked deliveries to Ireland.Ireland had the second highest rate of vaccinations per capita in the EU up to the end of last week as official figures show that 3 per cent of the population have been inoculated – 77,000 frontline health workers and 66,000 residents of elderly care facilities.Dublin had been heavily reliant on the AstraZeneca vaccine to meet its target of fully vaccinating 700,000 people by the end of March.Last week it emerged that Ireland would receive 300,000 AstraZeneca jabs compared to an original pledge of 600,000 doses.Last night however, following negotiations between Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, and AstraZeneca, Ireland will receive an extra 100,000 doses of the vaccine.The government has lowered its target to vaccinating 600,000 people by the end of the first quarter, although following the announcement by Pfizer that it will deliver an extra 75 million jabs to the EU in the second quarter, Irish officials are confident that they will meet the overall target of inoculating 70 per cent of the adult population by September.The view in Irish government circles is that by the time the UK has reached herd immunity, Ireland should have access to more than enough doses through the EU program to meet vaccination capacity.Ireland has access to 1 per cent of the Commission’s portfolio of 2.3 billion vaccines, which is enough to cover the population twice.Even though there has been a lot of criticism in Ireland of the EU Commission’s procurement policy, which was seen as overly bureaucratic, privately political sources have said that if it had been a free-for-all among member states, the country would have been in a much worse position.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"israel exports settlement wines united arab emirates latest","story":"Israel has begun exporting wine, olive oil and honey from West Bank settlements to the United Arab Emirates, a major deal secured by the Abraham Accords which has delighted Jewish expats but alarmed Palestinian leaders.Tura Winery, in the Rehelim settlement, and Paradise Honey in Hermesh, have sent shipments to Emirati clients which they hope will quench a thirst in the Gulf state’s Jewish community for kosher wines.It follows a historic normalisation treaty, the Abraham Accords, which was signed by the US, Israel, Bahrain and the UAE. The pact has set up full diplomatic ties and unlocked dozens of lucrative trade deals.Though popular in the UAE, the goods are controversial as they were produced in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which the Palestinians claim as their own land. The settlements are regarded as illegal under international law by many countries, though Israel disputes this.Britain has said it is “deeply concerned” about settlement expansion in the West Bank, while President Joe Biden has signalled that he will adopt a tougher stance on them than the Trump administration.But an Emirati official told the  that it had no issue with the settlements, as they support Palestinians by offering job opportunities.Wines from Israel have already seen strong demand in the UAE, with alcohol supplier MMI offering a line of whiskies produced in Tel Aviv called Milk and Honey.Lindsay Trivers, a sommelier and founder of The Tasting Class in Dubai, said demand had significantly increased in the wake of the Abraham Accords.“There are five labels here or on their way in so we are looking at desert-themed wine tasting and an ancient world wine lesson looking at the history and differences in styles.”Vered Ben-Sa’adon, the owner of Tura Winery, which is sending Made in Israel-labelled bottles to the UAE, said Emiratis were curious to learn more about the settlements.The deal on settlements has alarmed Palestinian leaders, who vehemently condemned the Abraham Accords as a “stab in the back.” The Palestinian Authority says Arab states should not embrace Israel until the creation of a viable Palestinian state.Ammar Hijazi, an assistant minister for foreign affairs at the Palestinian Authority, said they were considering international legal action over the deal.The bottom line is every product made in a settlement is stealing Palestinian resources, he said. We will ensure these companies are held to account.One Palestinian official said: Allowing Arab brothers and sisters to consume goods produced on stolen land and resources- to consume Palestinian blood diamonds - is utterly immoral, illegal and a vindictive policy against world efforts to end Israel’s occupation, colonisation and annexation.The  approached UAE representatives in London for comment but did not receive a response.However an Emirati official said, on condition of anonymity: “The UAE government always supports the Palestinian people and has always supported them, and always will.“As such, the UAE government encourages purchase of products which come from companies and organisations that provide jobs and monetary support to Palestinian people regardless of the location of the factory.Elie Abadie, senior rabbi of the Jewish Council of the Emirates, strongly rejected criticism of the settlement deal.“Boycotting products from those areas will be hurting the Palestinians themselves, so why would the UAE boycott the goods of the occupied territories? he asked.When you normalise with a country, it has to be an all or nothing process,” he added.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"reckoning coming vladimir putin","story":"Even in the depths of a Russian winter and under pain of a beating from the police or years in jail, thousands of protesters took to the streets yesterday in the biggest series of demonstrations seen in the post-Soviet era. Ostensibly, they were demanding the release of Alexei Navalny, the opposition politician who returned to Moscow after recovering in Germany from an attempt to kill him with a nerve agent.His courage in risking imprisonment or even assassination by going back has helped galvanise a growing hostility to Vladimir Putin, whose 20-year grip on power is facing its biggest challenge. The Russian president has seen off similar protests in the past because they were largely limited to activists in the major cities. He has relied on the support of the vast bulk of the populace, using military adventurism to stoke nationalist fervour, such as the annexation of Crimea.But in the midst of a pandemic that has thrown world economic growth into reverse, Russia is suffering more than most. Sanctions have caused foreign investment to dry up apart from in the energy sector and there is not much domestic investment either. The Russian people can see that Mr Putin’s two decades in power have not brought prosperity, nor made “Russia great again”. His one advantage is that the opposition is disunited and has no coherent vision of Russia’s future.This year will see elections that Mr Putin will try to manipulate by banning opponents from standing against his United Russia party. In a bid to stifle demonstrations, Moscow has portrayed Mr Navalny as a “puppet” of the West seeking to undermine Russia. But these protests are not about Mr Navalny.

The latest, a report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS), suggests that each pupil at home today could go on to lose an average of £40,000 in future lifetime earnings.When schools shut their doors to the vast majority of children last March, few suspected they would remain closed for so long. Following September’s return, many were subsequently sent home again, often more than once, if someone in their bubble tested positive for coronavirus. By the time they are finally allowed back in school, most will have suffered a whole year of educational disruption in one form or another.Almost twelve months on, children remain at home even though we can see the damage this is doing. Most schools have improved remote teaching since the first lockdown but, sadly, even the very best online learning is no substitute for the discipline of the classroom and the interaction of face-to-face teaching.Research published last week shows that year 2 pupils, those aged six and seven, had significantly lower achievement in both reading and maths in autumn 2020 when compared to children of the same age in previous years. A survey carried out back in September suggested pupils of all ages were, even then, three months behind in their studies. The current lockdown will only compound these learning deficits.We know that school closures do not impact all children equally: those from the poorest homes suffer most of all. The research into year 2 pupils suggests disadvantaged children have fallen seven months behind their wealthier classmates in both reading and maths. This means that poorer children will potentially leave school with fewer qualifications, or score lower grades, than they would have done if their education had not been so badly disrupted.The IFS has now put a price on this educational short fall. It points to the World Bank’s calculation that, in advanced economies, each year of schooling increases an inidual\u0027s future earnings by an average of eight per cent a year. This means that school closures could lead to a combined loss of £350 billion in earnings for the UK’s school children with disastrous implications for tax revenue and national economic growth. We know that, just as with education, it will be children from the poorest families who stand to lose most financially, reproducing inequalities across the generations.Evidence is also mounting of more immediate harms from keeping children out of school. We know that the number of children being referred for specialist mental health support has hit a record high. There are concerns that short-sightedness in children could be on the rise due to excessive screen time. We know that children are now less physically active, with 43 per cent doing less than half an hour of activity a day. This is, of course, in addition to the immeasurable impact of loneliness and isolation.The government is clearly concerned about the risks of children transmitting Covid-19 if schools are open to all pupils. But risk aversion in this one area is overshadowing growing evidence of the multiple harms inflicted upon children by keeping schools closed. Now, even lockdown advocates like Scotland’s Professor Devi Sridhar, are expressing concern about the harm to children of being kept out of school.The truth is, in shutting schools our children have been made subjects in an unprecedented national experiment. We can conjecture, but no one really has insight into the long term impact lockdown will have on their employment prospects or earnings potential. But we do know the damage school closures are doing right now to children’s educational, mental, physical and social development. It is time for the government to be far more concerned about the risks of keeping children out of school.The IFS argue that the £1.3 billion so far pledged for provision to help children ‘catch up’ is not enough. But neither is it sufficient for the Prime Minister to announce that some pupils may, perhaps, begin returning to school on March 8th. The evidence that children need to be back in school has become too vast to ignore. We need to stop experimenting on our children and reopen schools to all pupils before yet another month passes us by.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"union isnt just keeping scotland happy","story":"When the next Scottish independence referendum comes, and come it will, one big difference from 2014 will be the silence of the English. Last time, we rushed north to say “please stay!”, and some of us will do so again. But fewer. Is it any wonder? We’ve had seven years of being told we’re rich Tory monsters and the average Scot hates us. This has had its effect on British self-perception. Unionists shoulder some of the blame.The SNP are just being the SNP, and the irony is that their most successful theatre of operation isn’t the Scottish Parliament, which no one bothers to watch, least of all the Scottish, but Westminster where they have reinforced the lie that Scotland is a one party nation and a one issue polity.The strategy is to go on and on about the same damn subject to the point that English (or Welsh or Northern Irish) voters are no longer angry about it, they’re sick of hearing about it. It’s like living with a grumpy teenager. You love them, sure, but they’re so relentlessly morose that you’re secretly looking forward for the day they move out, when you can get on with your life and turn their bedroom into a gym.The Cabinet is ided over the best way forward. Some Tories, linked to Michael Gove, want to work constructively with devolved administrations others, closer to the PM, favour a “muscular unionism” that perhaps takes powers away from Edinburgh and redistributes them to local authorities – with agreement on both sides that they should splash the cash on big projects and smother them in the Union Jack (not unlike the EU used to do).But the wider problem is that since 2014, Westminster has conceded that the future of the Union is a wholly Scottish question, that whenever it comes up the priority is to ine what the Scots want and what will keep them happy. All our establishment really has to say to the Scottish people is “how much will it cost to persuade you to stay?”, which is tawdry. Unions are meant to last “in sickness or in health”. We all like a bit of romance.I love Scotland. I can say that more intelligently than I did in 2014 because, since then, I’ve made an effort to get to know it and now have an infinitely better appreciation for its landscape, art and people - and how they relate to my own identity (I bet I’m the only  journalist who goes to bed in Celtic pyjamas).I’ve also realised that I like Unionism precisely because, like my Catholicism, it connects me to utter strangers. The English and the Scottish are chalk-and-cheese, ain’t that the truth, but the idea that very different cultures can be united in a single national project is exhilarating and provides a necessary alternative to ethnic chauvinism. Britishness is both provincial and cosmopolitan the differences between us can be a point of tension but also, as in a marriage, of fascination and affection. Crucially, however, that interest has to go both ways.Right now, Unionism is uni-directional: it feels like everything is focused on pouring love on Scotland. When did we last hear a Unionist hymn for the wonders of Wales, Northern Ireland or England, which has its own poverty as well as treasures?When the PM visited Scotland last week, the tour was treated as politically awkward. Even some Scottish Unionists were on edge, warning that Boris embodies the qualities of England most Scots dislike.This is not on. Putting aside the fact that 38 per cent of Scots voted for Brexit, and a quarter of them voted Tory in 2019, the claim that Boris is beyond the pale because he is posh and conservative can only be read as an insult by Englishmen who are posh and conservative, along with the millions who are neither of those things but still think it should be uncontroversial for a British PM to visit a part of Britain in the middle of a pandemic that Britons are fighting together.And we know full well that this isn’t just about Boris. It was also agreed that David Cameron should avoid campaigning in person during the 2014 referendum in case he reminded some Scots of why they hate us – and even the appearance of Ed Miliband in Edinburgh, the most inoffensive man you could hope to meet, was a PR disaster. He had to escape through a side-door, chased by protestors calling him a “liar” and, bizarrely, a “serial murderer.”Those people, of course, are the worst of the nationalists, and another reason to fight for the Union is to defeat them and their risible claim that they are Scotland and anyone who doesn’t sign up to their narrow, often spiteful definition of Scottishness isn’t.But it’s hard to conceive of a bigger, cross-class, cross-national unionism when the English politicians who most love the Union are regarded as best kept away from the debate. When that happens, one has to ask, first, “what is the acceptable face of England in 21st century Scotland?” and, second, “what kind of Unionism are we fighting for here?” One in which we are all included, or which is packaged purely to keep one constituent group on board?My fear is that unionists will have to fight the next referendum on two fronts, not just one, and that while the battle for the Union is being waged in Scotland, the war is being quietly lost in England.

Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch publicly attacked a reporter, baselessly accusing her of “sowing distrust” and “undermining” efforts to increase take-up of Covid- vaccines, after she sent an email asking why she didn’t take part in a video campaign. And today Number  refused to condemn the minister’s outburst, saying she felt she “has grounds” to describe basic journalism as “creepy” - and that she had been civil. HuffPost journalist Nadine White had approached the minister, as well as her press team, to ask for her comment on claims she had refused to take part in the cross-party video. But instead of replying to the question, Ms Badenoch tweeted images of the emailed request for comment, accusing the journalist of trying to sow distrust in the vaccine by making up claims. No article was published about the claims prior to Ms Badenoch publicly complaining about the routine email. Boris Johnson ’s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, refused to say whether Ms Badenoch should withdraw the comments, or whether she would face disciplinary action.Ms Stratton suggested contacting Ms Badenochaposs office for comment on her motives. It comes just a week after she said the Prime Minister wanted people to remain “civil” in political discussions. “I think Kemi has been civil to Nadine White,” Ms Stratton said. “Kemi felt that she was working very hard to improve confidence in the black community in taking the jab, and she felt that questions about why she wasn’t in the video were not right when she was not in the video because she was taking part in a trial.” She added: “I think this is a case of a misunderstanding between the two parties and the key thing is that both Nadine White and Kemi Badenoch are working hard to try and improve confidence in vaccine-hesitant communities, making sure those communities feel greater confidence in the vaccine.” But she would not say who was responsible for the “misunderstanding”. Despite defending Ms Badenoch’s outburst, Ms Stratton said the Prime Minister “respects” the work of journalists, saying it was an “important role.”In a y Twitter thread on Friday, Ms Badenoch claimed it was unimportant that she had not taken part in the video.Instead, she claimed the HuffPost website had published numerous articles about how Covid impacts black people, yet are quite happy to undermine our efforts to build trust in the vaccine by making absurd claims. She added: Itaposs also creepy and bizarre to fixate on who didnapost participate in a video and demand they explain themselves.” “As a govt minister I have a ,” she added. “But it worries me that other people with less of a voice can be smeared in this way.

The MP was serving as the Party’s Shadow Secretary of State for the Home Department and Justice. Tommy Sheppard, the partyaposs shadow Cabinet Office spokesman, has also lost his role and been moved to constitution spokesman in a reshuffle of the SNP pack. Cherry tweeted: Despite hard work, results and a strong reputation I’ve been sacked today from the SNP front bench. My constituents  fellow party members who gave me a resounding mandate in recent NEC elections should rest assured that I will continue to work hard for them.” A prominent feminist, Cherry has been caught up in the massive internal row in the SNP over gender recognition and trans rights. However, she is also seen as potential leadership challenger to Nicola Sturgeon and was voted onto the partyaposs ruling NEC this year well ahead of fellow candidates. Last week First Minister Nicola Sturgeon intervened in the trans row after a number of young members left the SNP over the issue and the leadership’s perceived failure to tackle transphobia. Westminster leader Ian Blackford MP announced the reshuffle in a press release welcoming four new additions to his front bench. They are: Patricia Gibson MP as Shadow Spokesperson for Housing, Communities and Local Government Angela Crawley MP as Shadow Spokesperson for the Attorney General Richard Thomson MP as Shadow Spokesperson for Northern Ireland and Stephen Flynn MP as Shadow Spokesperson for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.Blackford said: We have a wealth of talent and experience and this reshuffle of SNP MPs ensures we are in the best possible position to hold the UK government to account during this global pandemic and the aftermath of Brexit, to support colleagues ahead of the Scottish elections, and to deliver independence. Cherry was frustrated in her attempt to gain a nomination for the Edinburgh Central seat in the Scottish parliament by a rule change from the party’s governing body. She also backed Alex Salmond by asking for his role in the party history to be restored after he was cleared of sex charges in a court case last year.

Ministers are deciding when to act after the UK stormed ahead with its rollout - with roughly million first doses delivered so far. Yesterday, Trade Secretary Liz Truss said Britain would help further-behind neighbours and not become a vaccinated island”. “In future months we hope to be in a position to help other countries with vaccine supply, she told Times Radio. But it’s believed that offer is unlikely to come until at least all the UK priority groups - including all over-s - get a first dose. A government source said: “It’s certainly not something we would look at until we’ve vaccinated the entirety of Phase .” First doses for the whole of ‘phase ’ are currently expected to be finished by the end of April. But help for other nations could come much later. Ms Truss yesterday indicated the UK might only help other nations by September, once all UK adults have a first dose. The top Tory told Sky News of course we first need to make sure our population is vaccinated. Sources made clear no doses would be sent abroad before the end of Phase  - but would not be drawn on plans for after that.  In total the UK has ordered million doses of seven dferent vaccine candidates since the pandemic began. That is enough to give two doses to everyone in the adult UK population almost four times over. But some of these doses are not due for arrival for several months and many are for vaccines yet to pass trials. The UK today added million doses to its million order from French firm Valneva, which would be made in Scotland. However, results from an early study are only expected in the next three months and the extra jabs would only come in . Scientists have previously suggested people may need to be re-vaccinated against Covid but that is not known for sure yet.

Being a doctor, she feared the worst straight away and she could spot the lumps on her scan immediately. After Sadie, now four, was born she had an operation to have the tumour removed and the surgeons found that it had not spread. She was back on her feet not long after, but had an important decision to make - what to do next. The -year-old, from Glasgow, said: After somebody has thyroid cancer, they are usually given radioactive iodine, a form of radiotherapy, to make sure it does not come back.  But that means you have to isolate for seven days after the treatment and avoid personal contact, because you are radioactive.   With two young children, I felt it was impossible to do.   Instead, after consulting with her doctors, she decided not to have the treatment and was put on thyroid hormones to replace the ones her body was no longer creating, which she will be taking for le.  Despite her healthy weight and active lestyle, blood tests before surgery showed Lauraaposs cholesterol levels to be double what they should be, which she now attributes to eating animal products like chicken and dairy.  Determined to reduce her cholesterol and remain cancer-free, she hit upon the benefits of a plant-based diet.  I conducted considerable research and found overwhelming evidence that it reduces the risk of heart disease and diabetes, she said.   But what really stood out for me was the reduced cancer risk to people with a plant-based diet.  It was backed by reputable science, rather than just opinions - papers from leading physicians like Dean Ornish and books like How Not To Die by Michael Greger, which has more than  scientic citations.  So, in July , Laura ditched red meat, dairy and processed meats for more fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, unprocessed foods and soya-based proteins like tofu and tempeh - convincing Roger to join her after showing him some documentaries on the subject.  Initially, we said we would still eat meat and dairywe went out for dinner, but when we saw the results almost instantly - feeling more energised and in a better mood - we committed completely, she said.   There was an adjustment, but neither of us crave any of the food we used to eat. I can never go back to my old diet now.  Laura, who was living in Canada with her husband Roger, , and their two children at the time, knows that she is extremely lucky that her cancer was spotted. She said: Not many obstetricians would have examined their patientaposs neck. He was exceptional and being extremely thorough. I am so grateful to him for that. The first time I looked at myself in the mirror afterwards, it was extremely obvious - but I had been so distracted by working and being pregnant, and with a young child to look after, that I hadnapost noticed.  Concerned, while the obstetrician did not suggest what the lump might be, he told Laura he would monitor it throughout her pregnancy. But she put her own health worries on hold when Sadie was born in August with two holes in her heart and without a thyroid gland - which is a one in , occurrence, according to Laura. I was worried about my health, but then my fears for my daughter took over, as they would for any parent, and she became my priority she said.  Luckily, at four months old, Sadieaposs condition stabilised, giving Laura breathing space to investigate her own health issues.  Sent for a scan of her neck in February , doctors then performed three biopsies and she was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer in March - a highly treatable form of the disease, which is three times more common in women than men, according to the NHS.    Receiving the news on her second day back working as a GP in Midtown Toronto after maternity leave, Laura - who was born in Glasgow and met her Canadian husband while backpacking in New Zealand aged , before marrying him in , and moving to his hometown of Toronto in  - said being a doctor meant she was expecting the worst.   She said: When I was shown the results of the first scan I had I knew what I was looking for - microcalcications in the lump - and I spotted them straight away.   That was so dficult, because I knew it was a strong sign I had cancer.  Although the result was what I expected, it was awful because I was still breastfeeding Sadie, had a two-year-old at home, a patient list of over  people and was away from my mum and dad, who Iaposm very close to.   Around two weeks after the diagnosis, she had the tumour and her thyroid removed at the cityaposs Mount Sinai Hospital in a four-and-a-half hour operation - which was far longer than planned.  Laura said: My husband was beside himself, because he had been told it would only take an hour, but the medical team thought it may have spread to my lymph nodes, so they needed to perform more extensive surgery. Thankfully, they were just inflamed.  My experience as a patient taught me more than any textbook or lecture in my  years of medical training.  It was in the patientaposs seat and the waiting rooms that I learned more about the importance of having compassion and empathy for my patients than I ever had before. She has now her personal experience into an online health  to spread the vegan gospel.  She said: Having a plant-based diet has saved my le itaposs been nothing short of transformational for me and my family.   Personally, it means Iaposm doing everything in my control to reduce my cancer risk but, professionally, I feel Iaposm doing a much better job as a doctor. Before, I was feeling like the typical burnt-out GP, handing out prescriptions left, right and centre to patients with high blood pressure and diabetes. But it is so powerful as a physician to get people off their medication and see them living healthy lives.  And the more she has advised patients about the health benefits of going vegan, the more she has seen some coming off their diabetes and blood pressure medication, as a result -  which she finds is aposcompletely empoweringapos for everyone involved.  Laura has also convinced her mum Susan Freeman, , of Glasgow, who has survived two types of cancer, and her dad Jeff, , who had a stroke in , to become vegan, too, for their health - saying they have not looked back.  Even Sadie, now five, whose holes in her heart have almost fully closed up by themselves, loves vegan food and cannot get enough of dishes like chickpea and caullower curry.  Louie has taken slightly longer to adjust and, while the children follow a plant-based diet at home, they can choose to eat dferently when they visit friends or go to parties.   Meanwhile, Laura has ramped up her research by starting a lestyle medicine diploma in  and going on a four-day course at Hard University in the USA, where one of the key speakers was Dean Ornish, the physician who first inspired her.  I was on the edge of my seat, I really felt like I had found my calling, she said.   In August , by then living in Scotland, Laura received her diploma.   In all my medical training, this is the qualication that means the most to me, she said.  My message to people now is donapost wait for a cancer diagnosis like I had to have before you start to think about your health. Sadly, her plans for two lestyle medicine clinics in Edinburgh and Glasgow have been curtailed by the pandemic.She said: Before Covid-, people took their health for granted but now it has made people more conscious of their own wellbeing than ever before, and as an unhealthy lestyle has been shown to make Covid patients more prone to getting very sick, now felt like the right time to spread the message about how diet and lestyle can positively impact your health. So, inspired by the success of virtual GP consultations, last month Laura launched her own online , Plant Based Health Online, with colleague Dr Shireen Kassam - pairing clients with medical professionals to meet their health goals by following a whole food, plant based diet. And in June last year, at her most recent check-up, Laura - who decided not to go back into a traditional GP surgery setting when she moved back to Scotland but is still in practice - was cancer-free, despite tests when the disease was first detected showing she was genetically predisposed to develop thyroid, skin, breast and bowel cancer.Laura said that because the tests she had are still new, it is hard to tell whether Louie and Sadie will be more prone to these cancers too, saying: At this stage, it wonapost make any dference to them, but it is why following a plant-based diet is so important for me and my children.” Registered with the Care Quality Commission, Laura hopes one day that the NHS will use her  as part of their care.  But she feels that doctors need more training to take nutrition seriously as a form of treatment.  "},{"url":null,"title":"brit man faces caning singapore","story":"NewsBrit man faces caning in Singapore after molesting girl, , while teaching her EnglishRichard Christopher Monks, , was employed to teach reading to a class of five children aged between four and five at a language centre where the alleged abuse took placemirrorShareByJames King:,  FEB NewsRichard Christopher Monks, , was employed to teach reading to a class of five children aged between four and five at a language centre \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for use in the UK on December , becoming the first coronavirus vaccine to be authorised anywhere in the world.The Government began administering the vaccine on December , with Margaret Keenan, a grandmother from Coventry, the first person in the world to receive a Covid vaccination. This was followed on December  by the approval of the cheaper and easier to distribute Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.  A third vaccine, produced by Moderna, was approved for use in the UK in early January, with several others expected to follow in the first quarter of . Nearly m people have already received the first dose and , the second, as of February  In December, the government published a list of nine vulnerable groups who will be given priority, following the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.

The plan has three phases, with the government committing to offer the vaccine to the top four priority groups, around m people in the UK, by mid-February.  Then the vaccine will be offered to the remaining priority groups, around m people in the UK, by mid-April, and all remaining adults in the UK by the autumn.

All businesses required to close or switch to a take-away service were told they were free to reopen. The BBC visited one Isle of Man pub that opened at one minute past midnight on Monday to serve eager punters the moment it was legal. Good morning ladies and gentleman, a pub worker cried cheerily as he welcomed customers indoors. Worth the wait, one punter told the cameras, as he took his first sip of a freshly-poured pint.

The self-governing British crown dependency had entered its second lockdown on January  after a rise in cases following seven months Covid-free. The islandaposs Chief Minister Howard Quayle last week announced the restrictions would lt. Mr Quayle said this morning in a statement: After almost a month of lockdown, this is the moment we have all been waiting for. The Isle of Man has achieved local elimination of the virus for a second time, meaning the risk of community spread of Covid- is extremely low. We beat the virus once and we have done so again. This has only been possible due to the seriousness with which the public have approached the measures set out by government to bring the virus under control and eliminate its spread.  This achievement is thanks to the collective determination, the sense of duty, and the community spirit of the Manx people, for which they are to be commended. But he warned locals must not let down their guard, urging people to remain vigilant. Signicant restrictions on travel to the island would remain in place and new arrivals to the island were warned to follow quarantine rules to the letter. Mr Quayle added: Last time we achieved local elimination, we enjoyed almost seven months of relative normality here in the Isle of Man. With this record, our strengthened testing regime, and the growing pace of our vaccination programme, I hope this lockdown represents a blip to the start of , with brighter days ahead.

The island has maintained strict border controls to keep out coronavirus, allowing its population to enjoy a relatively free way of le during the past year, compared to the UK.

Little Archie was born on May , , and his birth was registered  days later before an amendment was made on June . The totaposs birth papers no longer shows aposRachel Meghanapos as his mum instead it reads aposHer Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussexapos. The unusual change occurred as rumours were growing of a rt between Harry, brother William and their partners, The Sun reports. They claim the move is a snub to the Cambridges as all three of their children have Kateaposs names on their birth certicates. It may also be viewed as Harry placing Meghan at equals with his mum Princess Diana who always used “Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales”. Days after the changes were made, Harry and Meghan walked away from the Fab Four’s joint charity and had quit the Royal family within months. The caustic split from the royals was dubbed aposMegxitapos by commentators. Harry and Meghan have since moved to North America with Archie and secured lucrative deals with powerhouse companies like Netflix and Spoty.  Lady Colin Campbell, who discovered the amendment, said: “It is extraordinary and raises all kinds of questions about what the Sussexes were thinking.” Dickie Arbiter, the Queen’s ex-press secretary, said the changes could be an early part of their plan.” Royal expert Ingrid Seward added: “For a royal to change a birth certicate is unprecedented but to remove forenames is remarkable. “Perhaps this is another sign they were desperate to do something dferent to the Cambridges.”  The news comes as reports claim Meghan may notto Britain with Harry during several planned visits later this year. The Duchess of Sussex is said to be unlikely to accompany her husband at a number of s this summer - although the move is not said to be a snub. Sources, speaking to the Daily Mail, said the choice has been made for several reasons and her absence will avoid the inevitable public and media hype a joint appearance would bring. Insiders also stressed that the situation is still very much up in the air due to the ongoing global pandemic and other factors.

The omission of aposPrinceapos alongside Harry’s name was simple enough to correct , a challenge us mere mortals will thankfully not have to contend with, although particularly important for historical record one could argue. Latterly was Meghan’s alteration, but on first examination the original document appears to be entirely accurate.  The entry read ‘Rachel Meghan, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex’.  The amendment, which garnered the attention of the royal sleuths, saw Meghanaposs names dropped in favour of stylising the former actress simply as aposHer Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussexapos.  A range of royal experts queued up to deliver their verdicts - ‘Unprecedented’ cried one, ‘extraordinary’ said another, as one more declaredthat perhaps ‘this was an early part of their plan’. Within hours, palace sources attempted to quell the initial outcry, with the suggestion that both changes were down to “clerical error and nothing more than that.  But no sooner had daylight broken on the West Coast of America, Meghan has instructed her spokesmen to publish an extraordinary rebuke of the Palace, suggesting it was they who “dictated” the amendments, while calling out “senior Palace officials” as the culprits.  Royal sources have revealed this has been met with a sense of “bewilderment” in the Palace. One royal source revealed to me that Meghan ordered her staff to make the change to Archieaposs birth certicate in order to to fall in line with amendments sheaposd already made to her passport. The amendment was made by Meghan and Harryaposs personal team when they had their own staff based at Kensington Palace, who in turn reported to Buckingham Palace, so the sharp rebuke of the Palace makes even less sense.Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, Wiliaml, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis and the rest of the family.

In short, Meghan already stylised herself as aposHRH The Duchess of Sussexapos, dropping her given names - and wanted some form of continuity. Well, no harm there of course anditaposs good enough for Prince and Pele I suppose why not! However, courtiers have diplomatically suggested the tone of Meghanaposs statement from her spokesman was somewhat unfortunate. One aide revealed: There is no set protocol with these things. The birth certicate is a civic document so there are options on how it is filled out. The language used suggesting it was aposthe Palaceapos who aposdictatedapos it is somewhat unfortunate, as it certainly wasnapost addressed like that. The statement and its wording poses more questions than it answers unfortunately. Diana may have preferred to style herself as HRH The Princess of Wales, while Kate is listed with her full name on all three children’s birth certicates - ‘Catherine Elizabeth Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge’.  Some will no doubt suggest, does any of this actually matter or should we even care, especially given - as Meghan’s statement puts it herself - “Thereaposs a lot going on in the world letaposs focus on that”.

Samantha Spicer was nervous to attend her  week scan but her worries soon turned to giggles when she saw her unborn baby looked like it was wearing a mask in the womb. The -year-old hairdresser said: “It was a shock to see my baby wearing a mask in the womb, but so funny and it really summed up being pregnant during Covid. Even more so when just days later I was diagnosed with the virus. Due to lockdown restrictions, Samantha from Rushden, Northamptonshire, was forced to attend her antenatal appointment without her husband, David, . But family were quick to point out the funny side of the photo when they shared the news of their pregnancy. The couple who have been together  years and married in , have an older son, Harry, nine, and their daughter is due in May. The mobile hairdresser and her mechanical worker husband were left laughing when their -week scan photo proved their daughter was already fully aware of everything going on in the world around her. The ying sketchy shadows on the scan are visibly lighter across the nose, mouth and chin of baby’s face and the same lighter colour makes a clean line back across the side of baby’s head, like the string of a mask tucking behind her little ear. “It was so clear to see, plain as day,” laughed the soon to be mum-of-two.  And it wasn’t just a mother’s eye that saw the distinct oval shaped shadow on her little oneaposs face. “The staff looked at the monitor and then looked at me and we both started to laugh. I said ‘ yes I can see it too! She looks just like she is wearing a mask’,” added Samantha. In another scan photo, their daughter can be seen waving, with her tiny hand raised in the air. However, just a short while after the scan, Samantha tested positive for Covid and while they initially thought the photo was just a light-hearted coincidence, Samantha said she now feels the unusual photo had a deeper meaning. “We didn’t know it at the time, but after I was told I had Covid, it felt like a sign from baby telling me she would be safe, she said. We joked she was wearing her mask to protect herself from me and it helped me keep calm. It was a very worrying time to be pregnant and fighting Covid, but thankfully I am now over the worst of it and looking forward to a less stressful pregnancy going forward.” Samantha said the photo is very apt for the current global situation. “It just sums up being pregnant during lockdown and this crazy time. It’s an odd world we are living in right now and I think it was her way to let me know she is safe and happy.

The changes will affect millions of drivers across the UK with many of the changes already being finalised. Anyone who falls foul of the upcoming rules could be slapped with fines or have penalty points put on their licence. In some circumstances, motorists could have their car insurance revoked as companies decide to invalidate agreements, The Express reports. Hereaposs a list of seven changes drivers need to be aware of. MOT extension ends Test extensions come to an end on January  for many drivers after months of backlogs causing chaos in garages. During the first coronavirus lockdown, the Government announced a six-month extension for MOTs between  March and  July. Driving without a valid MOT certicate could see road users fined up to £,.  Brexit changes Although a last-minute agreement between the UK and the EU means British drivers will not need an International Driving Permit in most cases when travelling abroad, some documents are still needed. The biggest change is the need for a car insurance green card which is proof you have a valid policy in place These can be obtained from a car insurance provider but road users must have a physical copy at all times. Drivers will also need to take their VC logbook with themtheir vehicle is less than -months-old.  Mobile phone use According to comparison website Go Compare, a loophole which allowed motorists to get away with taking photos or videos while driving has been closed. Under the new rules, drivers can be issued a £ fine and six penalty points by simply holding a phone under any circumstances. New ALKS lane-keeping tools Late last year, the Department for Transport announced new Automated Lane Keeping technology could be available on new UK cars from spring . A government consultation was run at the end of  to look at whether the tools could run safely at speeds of up to mph.  New Clean Air Zones London’s expensive ULEZsystem will be expanded to several Outer London boroughs from October adding an extra daily charge of £. to millions of motorists. Bath and Birmingham will be the first cities outside of London to introduce new Clean Air Zone charges this year. Birminghamaposs scheme will charge this with the highest polluting vehicles up to £ per day to use the roads.  Green number plate changes Owners of electric and zero-emission vehicles can now buy the brand new green number plates. The scheme could launch a range of benefits for owners of fully-electric models with the Government hinting at cheaper parking and special zero-emission zones.

Each time the myth is basically the same - that for  years a man collected money from visitors parking outside Bristol Zoo. One day the man didn’t turn up for work, and it turned out that Bristol City Council thought he was collecting for the zoo, and the zoo thought he was collecting for the council. Meanwhile, he’d collected the money for himself and, as the urban myth finishes with a flourish, disappeared with a fortune to retire to a beach in the sun.Bristol Zoo has always consistently said the story isn’t true - and it isn’t, Bristol Live reports.But the campaign group Downs For People said it has unearthed the kind of historic situation with regards to zoo parking, which shows where the story may have come from. The group says there is no evidence that people unofficially collecting parking ticket money from zoo visitors did anything illegal, or even wrong. Instead, the myth was born out of the disorganised way the zoo’s parking worked for decades, itaposs claimed. The group is a coalition of local residents and environmentalists who have, for more than  years, been trying to stop the use of a large area of land on the Downs opposite the entrance to Bristol Zoo being used by the zoo as an overflow car park. The group’s spokesperson Susan Carter explained that there were people who took it upon themselves to collect parking money from motorists pulling up onto the Downs to visit the zoo, and no one quite knew who they gave the money to. “We made a surprise discovery when doing research in the Bristol Archives for our current court case: There is truth behind the myth of Bristol’s phantom zoo parking attendant, she claimed.  The failure to provide properly for zoo visitors arriving by car goes back a century, to the s. “For almost thirty years, from  until the mid-s, and quite likely for  years before that, people were able to make their living as parking attendants, collecting ‘voluntary’ donations from motorists parking on rough ground outside the zoo. It is unlikely that anyone made a fortune, and from  onwards attendants were authorised either by the Downs Committee or, from , the zoo . “It is not clear when the system of voluntary donations ended: attendants only started wearing unorms in , when a system of parking stickers was introduced,” she added. So for decades, volunteers not in unorm and ‘authorised’ by a loose mix of the Downs Committee or perhaps the zoo, organised the parking, and took money from visitors telling them because they were volunteers, they might want to make a donation. Downs For People even found the name of one of these volunteer supervisors - although there is absolutely no suggestion he did anything untoward with any money he received. In fact, Downs For People want to try to trace him or his family to find out more about his role.  “We even found the name of an attendant: Mr S W Barrett of  Westbury Lane, who supervised parking from ,” said Ms Carter. He issued tickets making it clear he was unpaid. Maybe Mr Barrett or his relatives will read this and tell us more about his role. “Unsurprisingly, motorists objected to this ‘voluntary’ system. Not only did they pay: the parking was chaotic and unsatisfactory, she claimed. “But the real losers, then as now, were the people of Bristol, deprived of the use of parts of the Downs by parking for zoo visitors, not just outside the zoo but on the grass off Ladies Mile,” she added. By the late s, the zoo had formally taken over the area in front of its main entrance. Despite the news in November last year that then zoo would be moving away anyway, and the issue of the Downs being used as a temporary car park apparently over, a l egal challenge from Downs for People is continuing.“Although closure will bring an end to zoo parking on the Downs, Downs for People remains very concerned,” said Ms Carter.

Juan Carlos Flores was delivering parcels in the Sunnyside neighbourhood of Houston, Texas, when he spotted the tot in a car-carrier on the pavement A nearby home surveillance camera captured the moment Juanaposs van pulled up in the quiet street before the shocked driver rescued the baby. Juan said he wanted to cry after seeing the baby on the roadside, before approaching residents to askthey knew who the baby belonged to. Describing his bizarre morning at work, Juan said: It was around .am and my first thought was when I saw, aposoh thereaposs a baby seatapos - never imagined a baby was in it until I passed. Then my second thought was probably somebody in the neighbour left the baby on the side of the street while they were moving things or on their driveway. So I continued making deliveries, but then the baby was still there.Juan then alerted a neighbour to the baby, who was equally as shocked - before the family took in the baby and Juan continued with his work, reports abc news.He added: After ing to the baby, I thought aposthis is not normalapos so I went to the nearest house and knock the door.They said aposare you kidding me apos and they come with me and I showed them the baby. The family contacted police and after Juan jumped back in his truck to continue work - he came across a police officer and stopped his truck to ask himthere had been reports of a missing child. He added: I saw an officer face-to-face and I asked himheaposs looking for baby and he said yes.

Melody Rose Gravitt revealed how she goes to extreme cost-cutting measures to spare the familyaposs purse-strings - which include even using the same bathwater. The mother-of-two offered an insight into her frugal le at the family home on Oklahoma, America, saying: I donapost buy toilet paper. I use newspapers that we get free in town. Melody even said there are rules to how the family can use the newspapers. She explained to TLCaposs Extreme Cheapskates: You take one sheet, you don’t need more than that, crumple it up, use it, and then you put it when you get done into this bag. And when this bag is full we take it out and burn it. Melody said she has had offers from friends and family to buy toilet roll- but the adamant mum said: Itaposs not that I canapost buy a roll of toilet paper. I donapost need to, we donapost need it. The family also cut down on costs by using only electricity, not gas, to heat and power their home. They also use a well for water and share one tub of bath water a day. She added: “To save money on water and electricity, we use cold water and the whole family takes a bath. My husband will take a bath, then I do, then Brandon then Ronnie. Saves us a lot of money.Son Brandon told the show that he sometimes wouldnapost mind a more private experience in taking a shower - but said he canapost really do much because my parents like to save water. Melody went on to explain how she only owns three pairs of shoes, a pair of trousers and around  tops. Defending her unique lestyle choice, Melody said the family have been able to save hundreds each year - meaning they can put their money towards a holiday.

But a teacher has left people stunned after revealing the names of three kids who have been in her class - and some people are having a hard time believing they are real.User @Ttcskrb says: So, I am a teacher and during my pre-service placements Iaposve heard some pretty unique childrenaposs names that theyaposve had in class.These three that Iaposm about to say are the most unique and most unforgettable names, erm, ever.

The teacher continued: The next one was a little girl, her name was spelled out aposH-i-j-k-m-n-oapos and her name... was Noelle. The clip has racked up more than . million views and , comments as one user explained for those who missed it: I just got the Noelle name. Itaposs spelled Hijkmno but the letter L is missing.

It is being hailed for inspiring people in countries around the world to band together in a call for an end to systemic racism. The global movement came to the fore at the death of unarmed black man George Floyd, after a police officer knelt on his neck. Protests spread across the globe, as the incident became a flashpoint for action in years of calls for justice over police brutality and routine racism in the United States. Over the course of the last year, the movement spread and broadened into a klaxon call for an end to racial injustices across the world. In the UK, the movement also turned the spotlight onto the bloody legacy of Britainaposs colonial history, leading protesters to take to the streets to topple slaversapos statues. The demonstrations rippled around the world as countries grappled with the coronavirus pandemic. A  report from the  Armed Conflict Location  Event Data Project  showed that about % of the protests in the US since Floydaposs death last May were peaceful and non-destructive.Norwegian MP Petter Eide nominated the global BLM movement for their struggle against racism and racially motivated violence.According to CNN, the Socialist Left party politician wrote in his official nomination papers: BLMaposs call for systemic change have spread around the world, forcing other countries to grapple with racism within their own societies. The BLM movement traces its origins back to  after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida. It was founded by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi, and has gained wider recognition throughout the events of . The movement rapidly spread around the world since Floydaposs death in May, as millions - bolstered by the connectivity of social media - organised action in the streets and declared solidarity with the cause. Mr Eide, a former secretary general of Amnesty International Norway, told CNN he saw the legacy from the US civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa in todayaposs BLM movement.  The Norwegian Nobel Committee has always recognized a strong connection between racial justice and peace, he added. Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, the World Health Organisation and young climate campaigner Greta Thunberg are among others nominated for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize. All are backed by Norwegian lawmakers who have a track record of picking the winner. Thousands of people, from members of parliaments worldwide to former winners, are eligible to propose candidates. Nominations closed on Sunday and do not imply an endorsement from the Nobel committee.

As boss of Tesla, SpaceX, and co-founder and founder of Neuralink, and The Boring Company, the -year-old clearly knows what heaposs doing when it comes to business. Plus he recently became the worldaposs richest person with a net worth crossing £ billion, so itaposs not a surprise that everyone wants to know his hiring trick.Musk is not interested in which school a prospective employee attended or even their level of education, reports the Daily Star.“There’s no need even to have a college degree at all, or even high school, Musk said during a  interview with Auto Bild. Instead, the father-of-seven looks for evidence of exceptional ability when it comes to hiring new staff. If there’s a track record of exceptional achievement, then it’s likely that that will continue into the future, he said. Of course, itaposs easy for someone to lie on their CV or about their achievements, but Musk has a question that is designed to catch liars out. Speaking at the World Government Summit in , Musk admitted he asks each candidate he interviews the same question: Tell me about some of the most dficult problems you worked on and how you solved them. A study published in the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition in December  uncovered several approaches to spotting liars based on a job interviewing technique that actually backs up Muskaposs technique.  One such method is called “Asymmetric Information Management”and is designed to provide an interviewee with a clear means to demonstrate their innocence or guilt to the investigator by providing detailed information. Small details are the leblood of forensic investigations and can provide investigators with facts to check and witnesses to question,” Cody Porter, one of the study’s authors and a Senior Teaching Fellow at the University of Portsmouth, wrote in an article for The Conversation. She specically said that interviewers should give clear instructions to interviewees thatthey provide longer, more detailed statements about the event of interest, then the investigator will be better able to detectthey are telling the truth or lying.  In contrast, liars wish to conceal their guilt,” Porter explained. This means they are more likely to strategically withhold information in response to the AIM method. Their assumption here is that providing more information will make it easier for the investigator to detect their lie, so instead, they provide less information. The study also found that using the AIM method can increase the likelihood of detecting liars by nearly  per cent.

The photo shows Levi playing with a yellow spade on the sand and his dad Duncan swimming in the ocea. It was the last time the boy was pictured with his dad. The family, from Victoria, had been camping at Port MacDonnell last month when Duncan disappeared in the water. His remains were later found near the popular tourist spot. When his torn wetsuit was discovered they first believed that he had been the victim of a shark attack - but further investigations led authorities to believe Duncan died suddenly from an undisclosed natural cause before his body was eaten by a shark. The family said in a statement: While we may never know for sure, based on the evidence we do have, we now believe it is most likely Duncan suffered a medical episode long before the arrival of the shark. It brings us comfort to know that he would have passed away peacefully in the water.

The coup was carried out during a series of dawn raids on Monday, just over two months after Suu Kyiaposs National League for Democracyparty won a landslide in a general election that the military disputed. Suu Kyi is popular at home but has been condemned for her treatment of Rohingya refugees and has defended the armyaposs crackdown on the minority, which has been called a genocide with more than , deaths, according to the UN.World leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, condemned the actions and unlawful detention of the countryaposs leader, President Win Myint and other senior figures from the ruling party as they called for the immediate release of those held by the military.The coup set off celebrations in the streets of Yangon by supporters of the army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, but the mood where was laced with fear, anger and frustration. Are you in Myanmar  Email us on webnews@mirror. There were major disruptions to internet connections for mobile phones that many people rely on for news and keeping in touch, and there was panic as queues formed at ATMs and banks were forced to close, and markets were busy as people stocked up on essentials. Here is a look at the crisis in Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country which gained independence from British colonial rule in  and had previously been under military rule for decades. What led up to the coup  Myanmar suffered almost  years of oppressive military rule before it moved towards democracy in , when the former regime agreed to hand power to a civilian government. On November  last year, incumbent Suu Kyiaposs National League for Democracyparty won a landslide in the general election to hold on to power. It claimed  out of  seatsin the two houses of parliament. But the army maintains a grip on control and a permanent role in the political system thanks to the constitution it created in . It it automatically gets an unelected quota of  per cent of seats in parliament. It controls the defence and interior ministries.The -year-old, first elected in a  landslide election after  years under house arrest, vowed to form a government of national unity as the military-backed main opposition party disputed the outcome. The Union Solidarity and Development Partywas drubbed in the vote, winning just  seats . It demanded a new one in order to have an election that is free, fair, unbiased and free from unfair campaigning. Myanmar’s army, known locally as the Tatmadaw, last week threatened to “take action” over the election. On Sunday, the military rebuked foreign embassies for voicing concern over developments in the country, where threats from the army and fears of a coup have overshadowed the planned opening of parliament.The army said in a statement posted on Facebook it “categorically denies” impeding the democratic transition and warned the diplomatic community “not to make unwarranted assumptions about the situation”.But it launched a coup in the early hours of Monday, the day when Myanmaraposs newly-elected parliament was expected to convene and Suu Kyiaposs once-banned party was due to begin its second term. What happened  Suu Kyi was detained along with other leaders of her political party in a military coup at dawn on Monday. The army said it had carried out the detentions in response to “election fraud”, handing power to military chief Min Aung Hlaing and imposing a state of emergency for one year, according to a statement on a military-owned television station. A veried Facebook page for Suu Kyi’s party published comments it said had been written in anticipation of a coup and which quoted her as saying people should protest against the military takeover. The coup derails years of Western-backed efforts to establish democracy in Myanmar, also known as Burma, where neighbouring China also has a powerful influence. The generals made their move hours before parliament had been due to sit for the first time since the NLD’s landslide win in an election viewed as a referendum on Suu Kyi’s fledgling democratic rule. How did people in Myanmar react   Swaggering supporters of the army chief swung through the streets of Yangon, waving national flags from pickup trucks to cheer on his coup against a democratically elected government. Footage posted on social media showed a crowd of several score gathered in the centre of Myanmaraposs biggest city to celebrate. But the mood where in the city was laced with fear, anger and frustration. Pro-democracy activists gave little credence to an army statement that it would hold a fair election and then step down. Activist Maung Saungkha told Reuters: They took power by force. Everyone feels angry and upset... I absolutely donapost trust the fact that elections will be held after one year and they will transfer power back.Zizawah, a -year-old commercial director who only wanted to give one name because of fear of reprisals, said: I feel angry. I donapost want more military rule. The way they act is like a dictatorship. All of us know who we voted for. Theinny Oo, a development consultant, added: We had a lawful election. People voted for the one they preferred. We have no protection under the law now. We feel insecure and in fear. Student activist Si Thu Tun said: Our country was a bird that was just learning to fly. Now the army broke our wings. Phone and internet connections in the capital, Naypyitaw, and the main commercial centre of Yangon were disrupted and state television went off air after the NLD leaders were detained.  News of the coup, announced on military-controlled media, broke sporadically because of major disruptions to internet connections for mobile phones that many people rely on for news and keeping in touch. Queues formed at ATMs, but many stopped working because of the disruptions to the internet while banks announced that they were being forced to close. Markets were busy as people rushed out to stock up on essentials. There was no sign of any anti-military protests on the streets of Yangon or in the administrative capital Naypyidaw, where parliament had been due to start its first post-election sitting later on Monday. Pro-democracy demonstrations were held in cities such as Bangkok and Tokyo on Monday. How have world leaders reacted  The UK, US, EU, Japan and Australia were among those who condemned the militaryaposs coup and detentions, and its declaration of a state of emergency. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: I condemn the coup and unlawful imprisonment of civilians, including Aung San Suu Kyi, in Myanmar. The vote of the people must be respected and civilian leaders released.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on behalf of the new Joe Biden administration: We call on Burmese military leaders to release all government officials and civil society leaders and respect the will of the people of Burma as expressed in democratic elections on November . The United States stands with the people of Burma in their aspirations for democracy, freedom, peace, and development. The military must reverse these actions immediately. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the developments were a serious blow to democratic reforms and urged all leaders to refrain from violence and respect human rights, a spokesman said. Chinaaposs response, however, was more muted. Beijingaposs foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said: We have noted what has happened in Myanmar and are in the process of further understanding the situation. China is a friendly neighbour of Myanmaraposs. We hope that all sides in Myanmar can appropriately handle their dferences under the constitution and legal framework and safeguard political and social stability.  Singaporeaposs Foreign Ministry urged all parties to exercise restraint and work towards a positive and peaceful outcome in comments that were echoed by Malaysia and Indonesia. However, other fellow members of regional grouping, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , took a more hands-off approach. Itaposs their internal affair, Thailandaposs deputy prime minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters Cambodia and the Philippines made similar comments. What now Experts told the BBC they arenapost sure why the military acted now. There are hopes the crisis can be resolved through negotiation.Gerard McCarthy, a postdoctoral fellow at the National University of Singaporeaposs Asia Research Institute, said: It is worth remembering that the current system is tremendously beneficial for the army: it has complete command autonomy, sizeable international investment in its commercial interests and political cover from civilians for war crimes. Seizing power for a year as it has announced will isolate non-Chinese international partners, harm the militaryaposs commercial interests and provoke escalating resistance from millions of people who placed Suu Kyi and the NLD in power for in another term of government. It is possible that the military hopes to improve the USDPaposs chances in future elections, but the risks of that are signicant, he added.. Phil Robertson, of Human Rights Watch, said Myanmar is in danger of again becoming a pariah state, but the people do not want a military future. He added: I do not think the people of Myanmar are going to take this lying down. Who is Aung San Suu Kyi   Aung San Suu Kyi, , is the daughter of Myanmaraposs independence hero, General Aung San who was assassinated just before Myanmar gained independence from British colonial rule in . She has been Myanmaraposs leader since  and is hugely popular as the figurehead of decades struggling to end previous juntas despite anger in Western countries over her treatment of Rohingya refugees after many were killed by the army. She was only two-years-old when her father was killed, and she spent much of her youth overseas. At Oxford University, she met British academic Michael Aris, who would become her husband. They had two sons and settled in Oxford. She ed to Yangon, then the capital, in  to care for her dying mother. There, she was swept up in student-led protests against the military, which had ruled since a  coup. An eloquent public speaker, Suu Kyi was a likely candidate to lead the struggle to bring democracy to Myanmar but the protests were crushed, its leaders killed and jailed, and she was soon imprisoned in her lakeside family home, where she remained until , despite brief releases from house arrest. Suu Kyi made a decision to remain in Myanmar to lead a campaign for democracy. Although the military made it clear she could leave, she feared she would not be allowed to . Related video from :  She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in , which her elder son Alexander collected on her behalf. In August , Suu Kyi had her first meeting with then President Thein Sein, a former general and head of the quasi-civilian administration, marking the start of a pragmatic period of engagement with the government of former soldiers. In , she came to power on a  of ending civil war, drumming up foreign investment, and reducing the army’s role in politics. But she has fallen from grace due to her treatment of the Rohingya Muslim people and defence of the armyaposs crackdown on them. She had promised Western allies she would address the plight of the Rohingya, forming an advisory commission headed by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The UN concluded that she was not complicit in the alleged genocide in , but she had failed to use her moral authority to help prevent the murder and rape of thousands of Rohingyas by the army.

The next day, Cindy, a hospital call centre worker, also passed at the Centinela Hospital in Inglewood, Calornia. Brianna, who described he parents as two angels urged people to be more careful. She said: My dad was going to get the second dose. He was so close but he passed away. People need to be more careful. The virus can take out an entire family in the blink of an eye. Brianna told how her mum Cindy, was the first to be taken to hospital and test positive when she started having breathing dficulties on January . She added: From that day on, it was a downward spiral. Cindyaposs oxygen levels were dangerously low and she was taken to hospital. She later tested positive for COVID, as did Ruben and Brianna. Brianna said: My mom said: aposBe goodapos to me as she was wheeled away. Thataposs the last thing she said to me. Two days later Ruben was admitted to hospital. He was feeling dizzy and his oxygen levels were really low, Brianna added.I didnapost know how bad it was. I always knew my dad as healthy and strong. Ruben passed away on January  at .am - that same day, Brianna was admitted to hospital for monitoring as she was having dficulty breathing. The next day, Cindy also passed away from COVID. Both Ruben and Cindy suffered from diabetes. I was in the overflow tent and my dad was upstairs, Brianna said. I left the hospital the next day, when my mom passed away. My aunt called me and told me. At first, I was just in shock - I didnapost think it was real. I kept telling my parents that they would be fine and they would come home.  Brianna was particularly shocked as her dad had received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine due to his work on the mental health ward in the Southern Calornia Hospital of Culver City. According to Pfizer data published in December, the vaccine is roughly  per cent effective after the first dose although the protection doesnapost kick in until at least  days after the vaccine has been administered. The vaccine is % effective at preventing the virus taking hold a week after the second dose has been administered. Brianna said that she and her mother had also tried to get the vaccine, but the hospital had run out of doses. She added: We were going to get it from my dadaposs hospital but we didnapost get there in time and they said that they didnapost have enough.  Brianna, who lives with her aunt, Salina, , and her grandmother Dolores, , is now facing her future without her parents. She said: I never imagined losing my parents so young, I thought I had time. Now my future is totally dferent. She paid tribute to her parents and said that it gave her comfort to think they were together. I think of them as my angels and I know they are together in Heaven.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the COVID- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us.From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government#s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month to fundraise in your  area, you can help to make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk or contact jen.lindsay@nspcc.org.uk by email.Jen Lindsay, community fundraising manager, NSPCC Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"boaters urged to abide by covid rules","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We can set up a chat within  hours and the service can be used as many times as needed.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind People Scotland, EdinburghDear Alister,In the weeks since the UK left the European Union, I have been contacted by numerous Argyll and Bute residents and businesses who share my very deep concerns about the future sustainability and, indeed, the survival of our vital shellfish and fishing sector.The seafood sector is a vital component of our already-fragile regional economy and is now hit by the inability, virtually overnight, for producers and processors to get their time-sensitive products to market or to customers.If allowed to go unresolved, this sector is likely to disappear, badly affecting Argyll and Bute’s overall recovery and future growth.Fish and shellfish from Argyll and Bute are high quality products of international renown.The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.I am now hearing from long-standing fishing families, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people that,urgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single-family operated vessels, smaller fleets and artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.As a council we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.We are also speaking to Argyll and Bute producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that these valuable products reach buyers.Delays on both sides of the border have already seen valuable products being lost, together with valued customers who are seeking their produce where.Very urgent action and assistance is needed now from your government in order to prevent this traditional Scottish industry sector from disappearing altogether.Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and speeded up.These products need to be prioritised over products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 29 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thatrsquos because it helps build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells. These are key to fighting infections.Popular citrus fruits include grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, lemons, limesand clementines.ZincldquoZinc is necessary for a healthy immune system,\" according toMelissa Snover, founder and CEO of Nourished.\"A lack of zinc can make a person more susceptible to disease and illness.\"This essential nutrient helps maintain the bodyrsquos ability to make new cells and enzymes, process carbohydrate, fat and protein in food and also increases the speed of healing muscles and wounds.\"Foods high in zinc include red meat, shellfish, eggs, nuts, wholegrainsand legumes, such as chickpeas, lentilsand beans.BroccoliBroccoli is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. Packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as many other antioxidants and fibre, broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables you can put on your table. The key to keeping its power intact is to cook it as little as possible - or better yet, not at all.GingerGinger is another ingredient many turn to when they are feeling under the weather. The antioxidant is believed to fight off cold and flu symptoms, combat nausea, and is full of iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium.However, itrsquos worth noting that a study from  showed fresh ginger may help boost the bodyrsquos respiratory system, but dry ginger did not show the same results.GarlicBefore it became a staple in cooking, garlic was actually used for medicinal purposes. From manganese to vitamin B and C, as well as selenium and fibre, it is high in immune-boosting compounds.\"Garlic is a potent anti-viral, anti-fungal agent, and eating it raw, or as an uncooked puree alongside your normal foodwill wipe-out most miscreants,\" Sara Davenport, health expert and author of Reboot Your Health told the .YogurtLook for yogurts that have live and active cultures printed on the label, like Greek yogurt. These cultures may stimulate your immune system to help fight diseases.According to Healthline, yogurt can also be a great source of vitamin D, so try to select brands fortied with vitamin D. Vitamin D helps regulate the immune system and is thought to boost our bodyrsquos natural defences against diseases.Sunflower seedsSunflower seeds are full of nutrients, including phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamin B. Theyrsquore also incredibly high in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant.Vitamin E is important in regulating and maintaining immune system . Other foods with high amounts of vitamin E include avocadosand dark leafy greens.Mushrooms\"There are approximately  species of fungi that have been identied with medicinal properties, and many have antiviral, antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory qualities,\" says Euan MacLennan, herbal director at Pukka Herbs and medical herbalist at an NHS practice in London.\"Mushrooms are high in beta glucans ndash natural substances found to help prime our immune system, making sure itrsquos ready for action to fight off infection.\"Red peppersAccording to Healthline, red peppers contain twice as much vitamin C as citrus. Theyrsquore also a rich source of beta carotene. Besides boosting your immune system, vitamin C may help maintain healthy skin. Beta carotene helps keep your eyes and skin healthy.Fermented foodsldquoIf you like saurkraut, miso, kefir and their immune-boosting relatives, add just a spoonful or two each day to your diet, says Sara Davenport.ldquoFermented foods encourage the growth of good bacteria in your gut and when their levels are high, so are your immune levels, defending you from viral infections."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-man-ordered-80-hours-unpaid-work","story":"WHEN police officers visited a womans house in Galashiels while enforcing a warrant, they discovered a -year-old man in the premises.But Andrew Atkinson was already the subject of a non-harassment order not to contact the woman and was subsequently arrested.Depute fiscal Ross Price told Selkirk Sherf Court the police had visited the house in connection with an unrelated matter at around .pm on December .They discovered Atkinson and also his partner who he was banned from contacting.The court heard that the partner had asked for the non-harassment order to be revoked.Atkinson, who gave an alternative address in Galashiels, was sentenced to  hours of unpaid work for breaching the order.Sherf Kenneth McGowan agreed with a request from defence lawyer Mat Patrick to revoke the non-harassment order."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-vaccine-passport","story":"A Covid- vaccine passport system may soon be introduced in Scotland.Jason Leitch, the countrys national clinical director, said the passports are an \"interesting concept\".But what are the passports, and how would they work in Scotland What is a vaccine passport A vaccine passport is an internationally recognised travel pass which would prove whether or not people have had a Covid vaccine.It could,implemented, allow people to prove their status and potentially travel abroad.It is being pushed forward by former prime minister Tony Blair, who told Boris Johnson thatBritain should use itspresidency of the G to launch theldquointernational Covid Pass.What would a vaccine passport look like It is far too early to say, however Mr Blair says he believes the passport scheme should consist of a single, standardised digital system. He says it should be capable of tracking and verying an iniduals vaccine status across the world.It could, according to Blair, involve not only how many vaccinations someone has had , but also any test results they may have had in the past.It is hoped that the data would be transferred using a QR code, which would be scanned by participating countries at borders and ports.Will vaccine passports be introduced in Scotland In evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Covid- Committee on Thursday, Professor Leitch said coronavirus is likely to be present in some sort of ldquoendemic form for years to come.When he was asked about vaccine passports, hesaid: ldquoI agree it is an interesting concept, the WHOhave begun to look at it.He stressed the latest scientic evidence suggests vaccination is not a ldquobinary state, but there is precedent for travel restrictions based on vaccination ndash including yellow fever certicates.Prof Leitch said: ldquoI think we will probably move towards that.

Labour has demanded a national taskforce be established to ldquoget a grip on the cladding crisis.Party leader Sir Keir Starmer, who visited residents of Royal Artillery Quays in Woolwich, south-east London, on Monday, said it was a ldquoscandal that tenants and leaseholders were being asked to ldquofoot the bill for interim safety measures.Housing minister Chris Pincher said the Government will announce ldquovery shortly a financial solution to protect leaseholders from high costs to deal with unsafe cladding, but told MPs: ldquoThere is no quick fix.Timea Szabo, , who lives in a flat with

Woolwich Labour will push for a vote on a non-binding motion demanding the Government urgently establishes the extent of dangerous cladding and prioritises buildings according to risk.Sir Keir said a national taskforce would ldquoput some energy into efforts to identy and address dangerous and at-risk buildings and he hoped the debate would be a ldquoturning point.It comes more than three and a half years after the disaster at Grenfell Tower in , which claimed the lives of  people.ldquoThis is not on, three and a half years after Grenfell, and this is not party political, he said.Appealing to politicians on both sides he said: ldquoLetrsquos come together, get something done about this, get the cladding inspected, get priorities in place, put the money behind the schemehellip and make sure the burden is not on those that bear no responsibility for this.Speaking during the Commons debate, Conservative minister Mr Pincher said the Government ldquowill not tolerate unnecessary delays to remediation work ndash more than three years after the Grenfell Tower tragedy.He highlighted more than pound billion allocated to improve the safety of buildings before saying of a remedy to protect leaseholders: ldquoWe have to bring forward a solution that is right and proper, that demands of owners and developers that they put right the problems and defects they cause, that is fair to leaseholders who should not have to carry unfair costs for problems that they didnrsquot cause or envisage, and that is fair to the taxpayer ndash who is already shouldering a signicant burden in the of many buildings.Mr Pincher said a further announcement will be made ldquovery shortly, adding in his conclusion: ldquoWe will work to restore the inalienable right for everyone in this country to live somewhere which is decent, which is secure and, above all, which is safe, a place that they can rightly and proudly call home.Ms Szabo, who works in financial services, said service charges for her home had risen from pound to pound per month, which was a ldquohuge and unaffordable increase.She added that many of the flats are now ldquoworthless and residents faced unspecied increases on

Everyone who did not request a refund of their  entry fee has a place in the  race.All other Covid-secure measures to be introduced will be explained in the race information email, issued closer to the time.Gail added: #Unfortunately, there will not be the usual post-race ceilidh in , as we feel it is unlikely to be acceptable to hold an indoor event of that size in May.#However, this is a part of the traditional event weekend which we will bring back in future years.#Entries for the junior race, to be held on Saturday May , will not be opened until closer to the time, when organisers can be certain that the event can go ahead # as much notice as possible will be given before race entry opening through the group#s websiteand Facebook page .In the event that public gatherings of this size are still unable to be staged in May, the race will become a virtual event, where participants will be invited to complete a K or half-marathon distance in their home area between May  and June , and submit proof of their run. T-shirts and medals will be posted out to participants on completion.Gail said: #It is fully the committee’s intention to host a live event, but we acknowledge thatthis is not possible then a virtual race is the best alternative, after the cancellation of the  event.

He is a part-time music teacher, with a passion for jazz, whose le has not gone the way he expected.Long story short, he gets an opportunity to play with his dream band. After this amazing gig, we find his character outside the jazz club, downcast and not feeling any dferent. His friend says: #You’re like a fish who’s looking for the ocean only to discover that the water you’re in is the ocean.#He missed the joy of the day-to-day experiences, thinking the big dream would make everything better. What a lesson. We can chase the dream only to miss the journey.Le in front of us is to be grasped and appreciated daily.

I was brought up in Princes Street and it was the first time I had been out the Wee Toon. I was only  or  so it was strange to me.I loved the folks on the island who made us so welcome. Once I qualied, I went around a bit, to Africa, west and east, and the West Indies, but Jura was better than anywhere I went. I hope the people of Jura see this.Leslie McArthur, Carluke, South Lanarkshire.I have contacted our roads department about the icy and, at times, ungritted pavements in my council ward.Many of my justiably concerned constituents have been in regular contact with me on this matter.With all that is going on, whether it#s the latest lockdown or a decreasing local authority budget, our hard-working roads workers are thinly stretched and do not have an easy task. However, when it comes to our pavements and roads, safety must always come first.Our pavements must be safe to walk on all year round.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands.The Scottish Government spin machine’s use of phrases last week like #encouraging progress# about the works at the Rest and Be Thankful cannot disguise its failure to make any real progress towards a solution.At an online briefing session last month, I questioned Transport Minister Michael Matheson on why it says it could take at least five years before it even starts work on a proper solution.He waffled on about planning permission, environmental impact assessments and compensating landowners. This is ridiculous. I’ve attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will delivers results, not spends all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people’s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal.The new year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the Covid- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 15 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It is stating the obvious, I know, but as we live through another lockdown, it is tempting to focus on the liberties lost and freedoms curtailed, when there are many good things still to celebrate.Not least of these is hope, another word that is used a lot in these days. We hope the vaccines will make a dference we hope things will get better we hope our children will get back to school we hope the planet can be brought back into balance we hope.But where is the ground for hope  Science and human skill A talk on the radio a few weeks ago, before Christmas, spoke about gts, and posed the question that the vaccines that have been developed might be God’s gt to humanity this Christmas, and the skills of the scientists ultimately come from God.Because for people of faith, the ultimate hope is in the God who is the source of le and who Christians believe came to earth in Jesus to show us the way forward.#For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son…# John :Where is our ground for hope  Surely the power of love is our only hope, the steadfast love of the Lord who #never leaves us nor forsakes us#and is with us every step of the way.Just be glad you have a glass.Reverend Steve Fulcher,"},{"url":null,"title":"sponsors kit out young pupils players","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The problem is, Smithy, a teacher#s nightmare, causes so much chaos that the head teacher ends up on a le support machine.Enter Dr Hannibal Lecture, the replacement head, and the stage is set for a war of nerves. The musical is on next Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the curtain going up at .pm.West Coast Motors will be extending its local town service to include the school on the three nights of the production.FIFTY YEARS AGOPaul abroadWhile the financial problems of the Beatles are being investigated in London, Paul McCartney is believed to be in America. He left his farm, High Park, on January , after celebrating the New Year there with his we and children.Visit on # but support is neededConfirmation has been received from the mayor of the French village of Montbeliard that a party of Campbeltonians will be welcome at the village#s music festival on July - this year.Provost Dan McKinven told the Courier: #I now propose to call a meeting within the Town Council Chambers of all interested in taking part. I would expect representation from pipers, Highland and Scottish country dancers, choirs and pop groups. Any inidual performer would also be welcome as a cross-section of our community and its talent is essential.#The present plan is to travel directly from Campbeltown to Montbeliard by luxury coach. The village is about km from the Swiss border and the city of Basel.Provost McKinven added: #We would expect to form a committee which would be responsible for organising the finance and travel arrangements for about  people inclusive of press, photographer and artists.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOTwo boys birchedAt a children#s court last Friday – Sherf McMaster Campbell on the bench – two boys were charged with the theft of purses containing money from a house in Burn Road. The crime was admitted.The boys, it appeared, were messengers, and the younger one was in the habit of calling at the house in this capacity daily. The purses were taken on separate days. On the first occasion a purse containing £ s d had been left lying on a small table near the window of one of the rooms. The window was probably partially open. After the younger boy#s visit in the afternoon it was missed.Next day a purse containing s d was left in the same position, and on the boy calling at the house, the occupier challenged him with the theft. He admitted taking the purse and handed it over to the owner. Only  shillings of the  shillings and sixpence remained in the purse.While this interview was going on at the back door of the residence, the older boy, who accompanied the other on the second occasion, appeared to have devoted his attention to the room where the first purse was got, and he possessed himself of the second purse and its contents. His lordship sentenced each of the culprits to receive seven strokes with the birch rod."},{"url":null,"title":"letters january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"mark beaumont goes the extra mile for marys meals","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The promise of food attracts impoverished children to the classroom, where they can gain an education that will one day hopefully be their ladder out of poverty.And thanks to Double the Love, donations made will go twice as far. Give until January , and the UK government with match public donations to the charity, up to £ million.Gillian McMahon, director of supporter engagement at Mary’s Meals, said: #Whether it’s doing your regular run, getting on your bike or upping your daily step count, we hope that lots of people will get moving and take part in Miles For Mary’s Meals.#Those taking part in Miles For Mary’s Meals are asked to ensure that they participate in their chosen exercise challenge safely and in line with Covid- restrictions in their local area.To find out more about organising your own Miles For Mary’s Meals fundraiser, visit marysmeals.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thank you for supporting us during this incredibly challenging time.In July we saw relaxing of restrictions, especially in churches. Was it the light at the end of the tunnel With hindsight, no. I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After nearly a year of people taking exercise and essential journeys on foot during Covid- lockdowns, plans to keep the nation walking are more important than ever.#The increases in people walking, has highlighted the lack of good infrastructure to support safe and enjoyable travel by foot. Communities that lack local facilities within walking distance have had challenges. That’s why we are calling for investment in everyday walking to build back better after the pandemic, and respond to the challenges of air pollution, climate change and Scotland#s health record.#Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, said: #We launch our manesto at a crucial point of change for Scotland as we begin to plan for le after Covid-. During lockdown, we have seen a rise in the number of people walking as many used it as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday le, to reach essential shops and services in their  area, and to connect with others and nature in a safe way.#But we need to do more to make regular walking an enjoyable and accessible choice for everyone in Scotland, from all walks of le. By investing in walking programmes and safe, attractive places to walk we can signicantly improve the nation’s health, reducing health inequalities and pressure on our NHS.#Brendan Paddy, director of Ramblers Scotland, said: #Our joint manesto makes a compelling case for investment to make walking safe and attractive for everyone in Scotland.#We believe walking can play a vital role in Scotland’s response to the challenges of Covid- and climate change # and the obesity, bioersity and mental health crises we face. Booming numbers are enjoying the outdoors in the Covid era and we need to support these people to continue to get all the health and wellbeing benefits of outdoor recreation for years to come.#"},{"url":null,"title":"why your business must act now to continue trading with europe","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It will be aired on March  at pm.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPressure piled on for quick Irish ferry decisionPressure was growing earlier this week on the Scottish Secretary to give Caledonian MacBrayne the go-ahead to operate the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Ballycastle in Northern Ireland.Scottish Office officials are said to oppose state-owned CalMac’s participation in the project.But earlier this week it was revealed they had asked CalMac to submit a business plan for the route. The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This adaptation means that they are ideally suited to being houseplants, particularly in homes where the owners are forgetful waterers!Succulent is a general description for plants that have tissues adapted to store water but doesnrsquot refer to a specic plant. On the other hand, cactus is a botanical name for plants belonging to the plant family Cactaceae and, for specic physiological reasons, may not always be regarded as succulents.Succulent suggestionsAmongst the toughest, most robust indoor succulents is the sanseveria, a wide range of plants whose common names include mother-in-lawrsquos tongue , snake plantand birds nest plant .With bold, thick, simple leaves, theyrsquore almost sculptural in appearance, tolerant of low light levels and, because they require minimal attention, theyrsquore an obvious choice for those with little or no experience of houseplants.Sanseveria are particularly good at improving the indoor air quality theyrsquore known to remove air pollutants including formaldehyde, xylene and toluene and, because they convert carbon dioxide to oxygen at night, theyrsquore popular bedroom plants.Another group of plants that are particularly easy to care for are the aloes, which the ancient Egyptians called lsquoimmortality plantsrsquo because they are almost indestructible.The natural healing benefits of aloe vera has made it popular for centuries and is iously credited with the ability to soothe irritated or burned skin, improve skin, hair, oral hygiene and digestion and to treat acne and arthritis.Like sanseveria, aloe requires very little care, tolerates low light levels and infrequent watering, removes air-borne pollutants and oxygenates the air at night, which aids sleep.One of our favourite succulents is the echiveria, which grows in compact rosettes of succulent, sometimes coloured leaves from which flowering stalks may grow.These plants like a reasonable amount of light, some dilute feed when actively growing and prefer under-watering to over-watering. A happy echiveria will produce little plantlets which can be removed and grown into new plants.Carefree cactusIt would be impossible to talk about easy-to-care for plants without mentioning cacti, which have well-developed survival adaptations.Most cacti have developed spines which in fact are highly modied leaves. Not only do these spines help prevent the plant being grazed, but they also reduce the airflow around the plant, which helps it conserve water.Photosynthesis takes place on the stemand its shallow, far-reaching root system enables the cactus to react quickly and absorb any water reaching the ground.Whilst the enormous tree-like cacti of the American desert may be the first cactus that springs to mind, wersquove highlighted some interesting houseplant types below that are incredibly easy to look after and certainly wonrsquot take over your home!There are many dferent shapes of cacti, including round, flat, columnar, smooth, bumpy, ribbed and fluted, and itrsquos important to note that some of these actually change shape depending on how much water is stored in the stem at the time!Not all cacti have fully developed spines. For example, the popular schlumbergera, of which the best-known culti is the Christmas-flowering cactus, has less modied leaves which look like lsquoteethrsquo along the edge of their stems. Their stems grow in lsquosegmentsrsquo and resemble flattened pads, with their flowers being produced at the end of the segments.Although the Christmas-flowering culti is most popular in the UK, there are dferent cultis which flower at dferent times of the year.In their natural habitat, schlumbergera grow on trees or in rocks and generally enjoy shady habitats with high humidity, making them an ideal choice for bathrooms.If yoursquore looking for an unusual and interesting but easy-to-care-for indoor hanging plant, you might consider the aporocactus ndash a group of tree-growing cactus that grow well in a hanging pot.For a cactus with impact, the gymnocalycium mihanovichii is a sure winner. The top part of the stem on this cactus lacks green pigmentand can be bright red, yellow or other amazing colours.So,yoursquore looking for a plant that thrives on neglect, hopefully wersquove given you some ideas!Just remember that the golden rule for cacti and succulents is to under-water rather than over-water ndash too much moisture will cause disease and rot.For more information, take a look on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"mary-contini-column-food-thought-covid","story":"To be able to buy vegetables from the likes of Crunchy Carrot in Dunbar or Phantassie in East Linton is my foodie heaven !It is probably more expensive to shop locally and, as you need to drive to dferent outlets, it does take longer.For hard-pressed working families, this is not always an option.

He says it should be capable of tracking and verying an iniduals vaccine status across the world.It could, according to Blair, involve not only how many vaccinations someone has had , but also any test results they may have had in the past.It is hoped that the data would be transferred using a QR code, which would be scanned by participating countries at borders and ports.In evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Covid- Committee on Thursday, Professor Leitch said coronavirus is likely to be present in some sort of ldquoendemic form for years to come.When he was asked about vaccine passports, hesaid: ldquoI agree it is an interesting concept, the WHOhave begun to look at it.He stressed the latest scientic evidence suggests vaccination is not a ldquobinary state, but there is precedent for travel restrictions based on vaccination ndash including yellow fever certicates.Prof Leitch said: ldquoI think we will probably move towards that.

While weve ditched single-use plastic bags at stores and supermarkets, cut out microplastics in face washes, and scrapped plastic-stemmed cotton buds, theres still a way to go in effectively reducing our use of non-recyclable plastics - especially in the kitchen.From yoghurt pot films and confusion over meat packaging, to crisp packets and anything that continues to be depressingly labelled not yet recycled, for many of us, the majority of our plastics usage stems from breakfast, lunch and dinner.Bamboo food containers, beeswax food wrap and brown paper snack and sandwich bags are all helping improve things, and are becoming increasingly available and familiar. Sometimes though, you really do just need a bit of cling film, and the traditional kind can make you feel so guilty.But things are changing,Lakelands new compostable cling film is anything to go by. We tested it out...Whats this new cling film Lakelands Compostable Cling Film - it comes in a mxcm roll, inside a cardboard box like the usual PVC kind.How much does it cost pound. - which equates to roughly p a metre.Compare that to Lakelands usual cling filmas well as Tescos own brand cling filmand their recyclablecling film, which comes in at p. Sainsburys PVC stuff meanwhile is p, and Asdas non-PVC version is a mere p a metre.Lakelands compostable version is undoubtedly more expensive, but arguably its worth it, considering you can sling it on the compost, rather than adding to the recycling system. Presumably, as more brands develop their own compostable cling film, costs will shuffle down.Whats it made of The box says its a polyester film specially designed to break down under home and industrial composting conditions, while Lakeland adds the film is derived from fossil origin.Do you feel confident putting it in the compost The cling film is fully certied for home composting, and is designed to break down and disappear within  months. Still, its quite weird to ball up a used stretch of it, and chuck it in with banana skins, mouldy bread and potato peelings. That said, Ive used biodegradable compost bags previously, and they really have vanished over time in the compost bin. Its a case of overcoming the feeling of wrongness when putting what looks like plastic in with the used coffee granules.How dferent is it to normal cling film It behaves almost identically to normal cling film - right down to the box falling apart as soon as it goes in the drawer, the serrated edge nipping your fingers, and, like with sellotape, never being able to find the edge without rucking the whole roll up.I was prepared for it to feel dferent, stickier maybe, or lacking stickiness altogether, but in fact,you hadnt bought it in the knowledge it was designed to rejoin the soil, you likely wouldnt notice any dference.VerdictOften adhering to the stick a plate on top school of storing fridge leftovers , I have long struggled with cling film. One that considers the environment though, does have a certain appeal.I found Lakelands eco iety does un-cling slightly after a couple of days, and doesnt crinkle quite so steadfastly as the truly plasticky original you also cant use it in the oven or the microwave.Butyoure prone to making too much soup, scraping the last of the risotto into a bowl for later, or have been making extra meal portions for neighbours or family members in need, its definitely a feel-good substitute worth investigating."},{"url":null,"title":"man-behind-scottish-art-scene","story":"Art critics tend to be art lovers.

Author, poet, dramatist and photographer, he was also a prolic and pioneering filmmaker, who made more than  Scope and Spectrum arts documentaries for BBC Scotland from  to .It was never intended to be a collection, and after a purchase had been made, artists were usually invited to the home they shared at Inverleith Row, Edinburgh, to view their work. One of the artists, Annette Edgar, recalls: ldquoThe first time I went to their house, Gordon told me in his big booming deep voice that I was going to be sitting next to a handsome six-foot-tall guy. It turned out, I washellip in the shape of a huge painting of mine of a running figure which hersquod bought at the old  Gallery in Edinburgh.ldquoGordon was very unassuming but very, very knowledgable about art. And Jay was a lovely woman who was a great support to him. They were very good at rooting out people and artists and they became very good friends of mine. I was devastated when he died. As were so many of the artists he supported. Gordonsmith kept on buying art after her husband died. In her final years, she was one of the most generous patrons of the visual arts in Scotland, making donations to the main exhibiting organisations in Scotland, all of them artist-run.The Royal Scottish Academy, The Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour, Visual Arts Scotland and the Society of Scottish Artists are the main beneficiaries of her bequest, which provides a ten-year guarantee of funding for prizes and residencies. Some of the artists in the Smithrsquos collection Jack Vettriano, John Byrne, Peter Howson, George Wyllie, John Bellany and Avril Paton, are well-kent figures beyond the confines of the Scottish art world.But to those who follow the comings and goings of the Scottish art scene, the roll call reads like a whorsquos who of mid-th century ndash early st century Scottish art.

In the course of his art critic years, Smith visited several exhibitions a week and his eye was keen and constant.There are several portraits of Smith in the collection, including ones by Moffat and by Hugh Adam Crawford . Both were subjects of TV programmes he made about them in the early s. Highlights from the unique collection are now available to view ndash and buy ndash online in a new exhibition staged by Edinburghrsquos Open Eye Gallery. While itrsquos never ideal viewing paintings and ceramics on a small screen, itrsquos a glorious sight to see an array of paintings, original prints and ceramics of this quality under one digital roof. Broadly-speaking, the couple were drawn to colour, figures, nature, humanity, humour and fine draftsmanship.From John Byrnersquos exquisite Painted Banjo , to a wee scrapyard sculpture of a dog by George Parsonage, and on to early gender-fluid and heavyset figurative paintings by Heather Nevay, there is much to enjoy.

They have long railed against the unfairness of the EUrsquos fishing quotas.

Although the industry is a big fish in the north east, it represents only .% of the UK economy a minnow in national terms. Perhaps thatrsquos why EU negotiators took the industry more seriously than their UK counterparts. While fishing communities complain of betrayal and sacrice, the Foreign Secretary hails a ldquogreat deal for the fishing industry.

But hey, few in Ms Prentisrsquo Oxfordshire constituency rely on fishing for a living.Ream more:Pandemic: Lockdown: Covid deniers should be held to accountThe impact of Brexit on the fishing industry has been immediate. James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink, has likened Peterhead fish market to a ghost town. Landings are down by around  per cent.

If, as Jacob Rees-Mogg claims, British Brexit fish are ldquobetter and happier, the people who catch and transport them certainly arenrsquot.

With most of the English editions of the Sunday papers applauding the Prime Ministerrsquos ldquovictory over the European Commission on vaccine supply, she had a relatively easy sht, her interviews as featureless as the stark white background on her video call.: BBC dismisses third tranche of complaintsThat would have suited Downing Street just fine. It might even have met with a sigh of relief from the Marr team. The programme has hardly wanted for controversy lately. Since last November there have been complaints about three interviews conducted by the Glasgow-born Marr. Allowing for the Christmas break, that is quite a run.Is there something particular to The Andrew Marr Show, or its titular host, that makes it a target for complaints The first batch of complaints arrived after he interviewed Scotlandrsquos First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on November . Marr had said that when it came to the First Ministerrsquos record on Covid, education, and the Alex Salmond row, there was a ldquogap between presentation and reality.The BBC did not agree that the interview was biased or unfair. It ruled: ldquoThe Andrew Marr Show is known for its rigorous and in depth interviews in which politicians and others in positions of power are held to account. The FM was asked a range of challenging questions as were the other politicians interviewed. Every interview is dferent but we believe each showed the scrutiny, detail and due impartiality the audience would expect.Next came complaints about a clash with Ed Miliband, Shadow Secretary of State for Business, on December . Marr was accused of interrupting too much and defending the Government over Brexit. The BBC did not agree, repeating the ldquoeach interview is dferent line as it rebutted the claims.: Protests over Marr-Miliband interview rejectedMost recently, complaints were made about Marrrsquos interview with the Prime Minister on January . Again, they mainly centred on interruptions and perceived bias. Again, the BBC response said the show was known for its rigorous interviews, etc. Again, the complaints were rejected.The broadcast regulator Ofcom received  complaints against the BBC as a whole for ldquodue accuracy or ldquodue impartiality bias in the first half of last year . That does not give an exact picture of the volume of complaints because cases only go to Ofcom after they have been through the BBCrsquos own system. By the end of the first week of January, for example, there had been  complaints to the BBC about the Marr-Johnson encounter.This is not the first time the Marr show has made the headlines for the wrong reasons. In  the BBC apologised for the presenter wrongly accusing Home Secretary Priti Patel of laughing about a no-deal Brexit. The year before, there had been a heated encounter with Shami Chakrabarti, then Shadow Attorney General, during which Marr said she was trying to patronise him.In Marrrsquos defence he had a long, distinguished career in newspapers before switching to broadcasting. Like fellow Scot Andrew Neil, he has interviewed enough politicians to fill the benches of the Commons many times over. With such experience comes confidence.Add to this the obvious preparation Marr does, and his determination to get answers for viewers, and you can see how interviews can become lively. Moreover, in the cases of Johnson Sturgeon Marr he was dealing with experienced politicians able to stand their ground.: The Herald will always strive for balancePost-interview protests, from iniduals or parties, have become an accepted part of the cut and thrust of politics today. Some shows may see complaints, particularlythey come from dferent points on the political spectrum, as a badge of honour, or a sign that they are roughly getting the balance right. If everyone is grumbling no-one is being shown favouritism goes the theory.Social media adds to the impression that there are more complaints about interviews than before. There is no need for the unhappy viewer to go through what can be a relatively y process of lodging a complaint when a tweet, complete with video clip, will make their point.As to why viewers protest, one has to believe they genuinely feel an interview has been unfair. For some, complaining will be a case of ldquosupporting the team regardless. Parties and governments may complain to put the record straight, or to fire a shot across the bow of a broadcaster in the hope their man or woman will get an easier interview next time.Perhaps the increased willingness to complain is part of growing consumer confidence in general. People speak out about interviews because they can. Whether they feel it does any good is another matter.As for the programme that bears his name, it still attracts the biggest names on the Sunday circuit, and the most attention. Marr is certainly not complaining about that."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-independence-unholy-alliance-scots-nationalists-liberals","story":"First up, the videos confirm what everybody already knows, that the SNP is a bit like any other party: an alliance of opposites, a church of zealots and agnostics, a boatful of dferent people sailing under the same flag .

Everybody is supposedly on the same side, but on certain issuesthey are ided.Read more:Why is Nicola Sturgeon backing Goliath and not David Faced with such a problem, every party tries to keep a lid on it, and sometimes they succeed and sometimes they donrsquot. For a while, Labour under Blair had control of the hard left because everyone saw that Blair could beat the Tories, and much the same has happened with the SNP. Nationalists can see their strategy works at elections so therersquos an incentive to keep schtum, and still is. Teddy Hope, a former trans officer with Out for Independence, says people have been encouraged to stay quiet on transphobia for the sake of the bigger cause ndash in other words, to stay wheesht for indy.However, in recent months, the issue of trans rights has increasingly put a strain on the unity-for-indy strategy. There have always been isions in the SNP, between right and left, hard-liners and play-it-safers, and latterly between Sturgeonistas and Salmondistas, but the trans issue is particularly signicant because it touches on something that, in one way, is the SNPrsquos greatest achievement and in another its greatest paradox: the alliance it has managed to forge between hardcore nationalists and modern liberals.The best analysis Irsquove seen of this phenomenon is in the new book by the political scientists Maria Sobolewska and Robert Ford. The main focus of their book, Brexitland, is the trends that led to the vote to leave the EU, but it also looks at Scottish nationalism and the similaritieswith Brexit. The political histories of the two movements may be dferent, they say, but the cores are exactly the same.What theyrsquore referring to is the ethnocentrist: the type of voter who has a view of the world in which their own group is the centre of everything. Sobolewska and Ford suggest the phenomenon may be an aspect of the authoritarian personality type ndash a tendency to value and insist upon conformity . They also point out that ethnocentrism ies by education, with graduates much less likely to express loyalty to a national unit. Ethnocentrists are also likely to reduce society to ldquous and them and feel aggressive towards ldquothem .The point the authors are making is that both the campaigns for Brexit and Scottish independence found their strongest early support from these ethnocentrist types and they still form the core of both movements. Whatrsquos dferent about the SNP is they were able to expand beyond the core and bring together a coalition encompassing ethnocentrists and ldquoidentity liberals: generally more educated voters who express higher support for inidual and minority rights. Identity liberals are the most likely to champion LGBT people in general and trans rights in particular.Read more:If a second independence referendum happens, the question has to be dferentWhat the SNP has been able to do is attract both of these groups by offering ndash in plain sight ndash something for everyone. Herersquos how Sobolewska and Ford describe it: the SNPrsquos narrative, they say, ldquomarried ethnocentric resentment of the English with centre-left economic ideology and promises of a liberal, multicultural Scotland hellip negative views of migrants and minorities wereroughly as widely held in Scotland as in England and Wales, but they were ignored by the SNP, who directed ethnocentric votersrsquo resentments towards London and the Tories.So far, it has to be said, the strategy has worked well, but it isnrsquot easy to hold together. As Sobolewska and Ford point out, levels of ethnocentrism in Scotland are comparable with those in the wider UK ndash similar numbers believe ldquobeing born in your country is important. It also ies in similar ways by education: English school-leavers see European migrants as threatening and many Scottish school-leavers feel similarly about English migrants. Voters of this kind form a big part of Yes support and the SNP needs them.The problem it creates for the party is that theyrsquore left trying to hold together a group that encompasses ethnocentrists who may hate the English and progressive identity liberals championing the rights of trans people. In any ordinary world, these two types wouldnrsquot belong to the same party and, as it turns out, not even independence is enough to keep some of the liberals within the SNP.The important question is where it goes from here and Sobolewska and Ford point out an apparent contradiction. The Brexit movement relied on its ethnocentrist hard-core while the SNP reached out beyond it, and yet Leave won and Yes lost. Why  Sobolewska and Ford say itrsquos because the attachment to Europe in England is weaker than the attachment many Scots feel for Britain. In other words, the SNP church was broad but still not broad enough.The obvious problem this creates for the SNP for the future is they need to broaden their congregation even furtherYes is to win, which means they cannot afford a threat to the coalition they already have.

Whitehall sources have suggested every time there was an intention to publish it, a development in the battle against Covid- pushed it back.Lord True, the Cabinet Office Minister, appealed to peers to have a ldquolittle patience and told them it would be published ldquoshortly. Last week, Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, hinted it could come this month as so-called purdah rules, that ban Government reports ahead of elections, kick in towards the end of March in relation to the Holyrood election in May.But, following the Prime Ministerrsquos visit to Scotland last week and in the context of  consecutive polls placing the Yes campaign ahead, Lord Garnier told peers thatthe UK did ldquonot make an effort, Scotland would become a republic separated from the United Kingdom, not because the moderate majority want that but because to misquote[the th century Irish politician] Daniel OrsquoConnoll ndash Englandrsquos dficulty is Scotlandrsquos opportunity.The former Solicitor General in David Cameronrsquos Government added: ldquoAre not the Unionists from every part of the UK letting Ms Sturgeon, or Glasgowrsquos de Valera[the Irish Nationalist leader], hold the floor because they fear confusing English Nationalism with patriotic Unionism and are thus failing to make the powerful, emotional and obvious economic case for the Union Lord True insisted he ldquocould not conceive why anyone would want to remove the Queen as head of state.He declared: ldquoEverybody should advocate the United Kingdom and our Union. We have no fear in doing so. And that goes from the lowest to the highest in the land and in every corner in our United Kingdom.Later, Viscount Trenchard told peers that the BBC, ldquofunded by the UK taxpayer, had, across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, reduced the airtime given to UK Government ministers while having ldquogreatly increased it in relation to those from the devolved administrations.ldquoThis strengthens the perception of separateness and has contributed to a diminution of appealing of Britishness and an increase in support for independence, explained the elected hereditary peer.He asked the minister: ldquoDoes he not agree in all parts of the United Kingdom much more airtime should be given to UK ministers and will he ensure the incoming chairman and director general of the BBC will correct the current harmful balance.Lord True said he would not give directions to BBC chiefs but noted: ldquoI will say, certainly, some people have found aspects of the coverage confusing and indeed perhaps as not as optimistic as they might in certain circumstances.ldquoI believe the nation does need optimism and it does need hope. I do believe that more emphasis on the joint efforts of the NHS, British Army and other armed services and volunteers right across this country at the moment deserves the fullest exposure, the fullest publicity and the fullest support.The issue of the Dunlop Report was initially raised by Lord Foulkes, who pointed out the Tory peer had been tasked to produce a document on the Union as far back as July .ldquoWhy are they afraid or unwilling to publish this report and the Governmentrsquos response, asked the Labour peer.Lord True insisted UK ministers were not afraid to publish the report and suggested the intention had been to publish it last year.ldquoWe want to ensure we provide a full a response to Lord Dunlop as possible but the key component of thathellipis related to the review of intergovernmental relations and we are hoping to carry both those strands forward at the same time, he explained.Crossbencher Lord Hope of Craighead argued that, as seen from Scotland, strengthening and maintaining the Union was becoming more dficult ldquoas each day passes.He suggested the UK Government needed to do much more now from within Scotland to ldquomake its voice heard there and its message understood.Labourrsquos Baroness Bryan of Partick pointed out the Dunlop Report had been completed before the creation of the controversial Internal Market Bill became law and asked how Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office Minister, could already be implementing the recommendations of the report when he had not shared its recommendations with the devolved administrations.Lord True insisted Mr Gove was second to none in reinforcing the Union and was, by definition, ldquoacting constantly every day around the aspirations of the Dunlop Report."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9426157.jpg?type=article-full","title":"covid-scotland-edinburgh-airport-launches-rapid-covid-19-testing","story":"EdinburghAirportandExpressTest

It pains me to see that with % of our children out of school as a result of school closures, we risk taking away opportunities from our own coming generations.“The pandemic has illustrated better than most things the full consequences of the digital ide, with which we have lived for too long we see those areas of the country that have access to connectivity and those that do not, and the families who have broadband and sufficient devices for everybody to get home schooling opportunities, and those who do not.

However, there is still some way to go before our inter-island service is of a standard we see where in Scotland.#Orkney SNP candidate for the Scottish Parliament elections Robert Leslie said that the additional funding was brilliant news for the islands. He said: “This delivers on the fairer ferry funding calls that have been made by Lib Dems and the local authority and shows that the SNP government is in full listening mode when it comes to island issues.“I look forward to these enhanced services and reduced fares being put in place. The next step will be to engage further with the local authority and other parties on the replacement of Orkney’s ancient internal ferry fleet.”SNP MSP for the Highlands and Islands Maree Todd added: “The additional £.m in funding for inter-island ferries is a positive development and delivers on a key ask from local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Whilst it is the local authority that is wholly responsible for the ferry services they provide, the SNP Government is sympathetic to the financial pressures which fall on inidual local authorities, which we know have been heightened as a result of COVID-.#She added: “It’s worth pointing out that for a long time, local authorities received no funding from the Scottish Government to support inter-island ferries, it is only under the SNP that this has changed and increased over the years. Today, we have a pledge to meet the revenue ask in full, fulfilling the SNP government’s commitment to fair ferry funding.“Considering the draft Budget meets a key ask from the Liberal Democrats, I hope to see the party get behind the budget and support it through Parliament.”Orkney#s MSP, Liberal Democrat Liam McArthur said: “This additional funding for our leline internal ferry services is undoubtedly welcome. Having been promised ‘fair funding’ by the First Minister since the last election, it’s remarkable how the prospect of an upcoming election concentrates the minds of SNP ministers.“Welcome too is the proposal to fund RET on internal ferry services. Some of these are amongst the most expensive routes mile-for-mile anywhere in the country.“Given we are still waiting for RET on Pentland Firth routes three years after it was due to be introduced and  years after it was introduced on west coast routes, it may be premature to celebrate just yet.“Of course, this will not stop SNP politicians from being first in the queue to pat themselves on the back. Let’s not forget, however, that Orkney has consistently been short-changed on ferry funding over the course of this parliament since the promises made at the last election.“There is a strong argument for the millions in under-funding now to be repaid. Indeed, it is a case SNP ministers themselves have been making to the UK Government over VAT payments for Police Scotland. If it’s good enough for police funding, it’s good enough for ferry funding.”The co-covener of the Orkney Greens, Councillor Steve Sankey welcomed the #long overdue# news.#The Scottish Greens won an additional £.million for Orkney’s ferries out of the budget settlement in , and this time around the Scottish Government has finally got there itself, after years of pressure from the three island councils involved and opposition parties,# Councillor Sankey said.“We’ve been saying for years that the knock-on effect of having to fund the deficit in ferry funding has impacted on us here greatly, and has precipitated budgetary pressures throughout Orkney. We emphasised that the situation was grossly unfair, particularly when compared to the huge increases in funding afforded to Calmac out west. The news that OIC will receive £. million next year is a relief, and will enable improvements in service such as Sunday sailings to the outer isles.#Councillor Sankey concluded: “Fairness with funding is all we’ve ever asked for, and now  years after Road Equivalent Tarf was first piloted, it seems that it will also finally be rolled out on our internal routes, although there is still no mention of the Pentland Firth.“Whilst this is good news, it now means that we turn our attention to the replacement process for our ancient ferry fleet which ranges in age from  to  years. It’s essential that any replacement proposals commit to a renewable fuel component, be it hydrogen, ammonia or electric, so that we can greatly reduce the high carbon emissions that afflict our marine transport sector.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time. To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space. The purpose of the licensing scheme is a set of mandatory standards which apply to all short-term lets and I imagine that the vast majority of hosts already comply with all of these standards – and more.”A working group is currently being established to develop guidance, she said, and there will “definitely be a representative from the BB sector, as well as self-catering to “influence, inform and shape” that guidance.She also maintained that the Scottish BB Association responded to both Scottish Government consultations on the issue, in  and , and were “clear that they were in favour of levelling the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb.”Ms Forbes added: “In terms of fees, there has been much concern about fees of several thousand points. The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process.

Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect. Everyone is talking about it.“It would seem, that a system of double standards exists, where one set of rules apply to the long-standing residents and a dferent set for the speculative, corporate developer who demonstrates no understanding interest or empathy for local heritage or the community they impose their developments on.“The progress of this application through planning has totally failed to uphold the objective of the conservation area and fails to recognise the importance of the setting of the listed building. Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/363-Katherine-Dix-Ceit-at-spinning-wheel-outside-Nissen-Cottage-from-Alison-Dix-daughter-via-EM.jpg","title":"traditional journey of the swelling","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSometimes we can follow the journey of a specic story by comparing earlier texts from the great collections of the th century with later recordings, especially those in the School of Scottish Studies archives available online at the digital archive Tobar an Dualchais. We catch characters, plots and inidual episodes changing to reflect new environments, audiences and times as each version is transported by the carrying stream.How a story changes informs us about the people who tell them – their culture, beliefs, and worldview. A setting may be changed to make a story more appealing to a local audience. An episode may be omitted because it isn’t seen to be relevant – or because it is too sensitive. The same story may be repeated because it is an effective warning: be wary of the wilderness lying beyond our township’s boundary.With the help of Tobar an Dualchais, we can follow one story’s journey from Highland moor to the island of Hearmatraigh, near North Uist, in real-time. Folklorists call this kind of story a migratory legend: where the same type of story is told in dferent areas, but with dferent settings and characters, localised where it is told.Catherine Dix, or Ceit an Tàilleir, was a remarkable storyteller who contributed hundreds of items to the School of Scottish Studies Archives. Born in , Ceit spent her early le in Beàrnaraigh, before moving away for work on the mainland at the age of . After a prolonged time away, she ed with her family to the island at the start of World War Two. She was recorded extensively during the s and s.One traditional story features a shepherd and his dog who stay in a shieling overnight. A hag arrives to warm herself by the fire. She swells to the size of a peat-stack, remarking that it’s only her ‘plumage’ rising with the heat. The hag attacks the shepherd but is driven away by the dog. The story is often called ‘m’ iteagan is m’ oiteagan’ : the phrase appears in most iants of this tale.Ceit recorded the story on at least three occasions in  , and with Iain Paterson , himself a native of Beàrnaraigh employed as a collector for the School of Scottish Studies. The  recording is transcribed in the excellent  publication by Ceit’s granddaughter, Alison – Ceit an Tàilleir.Ceit clearly enjoyed telling the story, but during a decade of performances it changed its setting: from a nondescript Highland moor in , to an unnamed island in , and finally to Hearmatraigh in . A story, originally set on the mainland, is gradually reworked by the storyteller, perhaps to make it more appealing to an island audience.It’s in the nature of migratory legends to change – it’s what makes it easier for them to migrate in the first place. But can we also trace where the story came from  Where did Ceit first hear her story: in Beàrnaraigh, or where Folklore recorders are trained to ask about where tradition comes from. At the end of every story, Iain Paterson would ask Ceit where she heard the story. In , she mentioned her father, Archibald Macleodfrom Baile Mhàrtainn in North Uist. But in the  recording she offered an extra explanation: the story in fact came from Archie MacColl of Ardtur in Appin, where she worked on a farm between the ages of  and  years. Paterson, clearly intrigued, asks how the story came to be set in Hearmatraigh. Ceit replied that Archie MacColl had heard the story from a boy from the Outer Hebrides who was working for him.It’s interesting that Ceit maintained here that the story was set in Hearmatraigh in both versions she heard – the one from her father and the one she heard as a teenager working in Appin. In her first recording she had set the tale in the Highlands.By comparing this story and its episodes to similar ‘migratory legends’, we can try to trace how it might have spread. The villain of Ceit’s story is the ‘swelling hag’. This redoubtable character is met with in a type of traditional story that once was told across Eurasia. It is known by folklorists as ‘The Two Brothers’.In the Scottish Gàidhealtachd, we have a version of ‘The Two Brothers’ recorded in Beàrnaraigh. It is called ‘Cailleach na Riobaig’and was collected in  for John Francis Campbell’s ‘Popular Tales of the West Highlands’ project. Despite similar wording between the two tales, Ceit’s story contains episodes not present in the  tale, episodes resembling other versions of the story collected on the mainland, east of Appin.On the whole, Ceit’s story is more similar to these mainland versions than anything recorded in the Outer Hebrides. Although she told Iain Paterson in  that both versions of the story she had heard were set in Hearmatraigh, it may be that, to make the story more attractive to an island audience, Ceit deliberately relocated an originally mainland story to the Sound of Harris. This comes through in the changing setting of her three versions of the story.But why Hearmatraigh  In relocating her story, Ceit chose a location which preserved the kind of setting in the original mainland story. She keeps the shieling, an outpost of civilisation in the wilderness where many stories tell of conflicts between human society and the supernatural.Hearmatraigh might have been chosen as it was one of the principal islands where Beàrnaraigh folk would stay in shielings for short periods to hunt, fish, and harvest peat. One recording on Tobar an Dualchaisnotes that the bothy on Hearmatraigh was built using lime-mortar: this construction technique would have made it stand out among other island shielings built of stone and turf.The Hearmatraigh settlement was centred around the natural harbour known as An Acairseid Mhòr. It is very likely that the fishing station from the time of Charles I mentioned by the Hebridean author Martin Martinwas located here. Could the fishing station’s ruin have been later repurposed as a shieling It may be, then, that when Ceit was looking for a local setting for the story she had originally heard in Appin, moving the tale to Hearmatraigh made it more relevant and appealing to her listeners. But with this clever transfer she also skilfully preserved the cultural signicance of its original moorland setting: a place out in the wilderness where dangerous supernatural creatures could overwhelm the unwary.Ceit Dix’s stories demonstrate the richness and iety of Gaelic traditional culture and offer a glimpse of how skilled storytellers adapt and localise their tales to entertain and intrigue their dferent audiences. contains some , oral recordings of songs, music, poetry and factual information made in Scotland and further afield."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3595857.jpg--.jpg?1611825143000\n","title":"big ballymena response sought for big garden birdwatch 2021","story":"RSPB NI is hoping that more people from the Ballymena area than ever will celebrate their love of nature and unite to count garden birds at the end of January for the annual Big Garden Birdwatch.In the past year, it’s been clear to see how important the natural world is to everyone’s mental health and wellbeing. There has been a surge in interest in the nature on our doorsteps and many people have come to rely on garden birds to bring joy and comfort in these unsettling times. This year’s event takes place on Friday , Saturday  and Sunday  January. People are being asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden, then send their results to the RSPB. Close to half a million people join in the Birdwatch every year across the UK. Just under , people from Northern Ireland took part last year.Anne-Marie McDevitt, RSPB NI Head of Species, said: “With more people having to stay at home over the past year, everyone has been spending more time outdoors and in gardens and I think as a result have been noticing nature more and having more time to engage with it.“Last year people were asking usmore birds were singing during the lockdown, but it’s not that there has been more wildle about it’s just that we’ve had more time and space to notice it.“By taking part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, you are helping to build an annual snapshot of how our birdle is doing. It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it. We’ve noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.”Just one hour every year for the last four decades has made the RSPB’s Big Garden Birdwatch the world’s largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted. Last year’s results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens. Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  , starlings were the most-spotted birds in counties Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry – ahead of house sparrows – while Fermanagh’s number one bird was the chaffinch.Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world. While house sparrows and starlings may be the UK’s most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at Big Garden Birdwatch data shows that numbers have dropped dramatically since the Birdwatch began in . House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %. It’s a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.

I have always been clear that the furlough and the self-employed schemes are essential and must remain in place until there are clear signs of economic recovery.“Since last March, I have lobbied hard with national government on this issue and I will continue to do so. It is vital workers across Northern Ireland must be able to access the support they need, not just to protect their livelihoods now, but to be in a position to plan ahead towards recovery with some degree of certainty.“It is so important that we get infections under control and allow people and business to get back to work as soon as is feasible in order to begin the process of recovery. However, these figures demonstrate that too many workers are still reliant on this essential support. Therefore it is too early to consider stopping it.“That is why I am calling on the Chancellor to extend both schemes beyond the end of April .”According to HMRC figure, Northern Ireland has a % take-up rate on the CJRS of eligible employments as at  December.

The duo also raised money during last summer#s lockdown to buy washing machines for a group of vulnerable families. My background is in teaching and I do a lot of school support work for the organisation I am with now, explained Peter.The big thing over the last while is laptops and devices for homeschooling. The fact we are in another lockdown means this issue has raised its head again.Jackie is a social worker and works directly with families in the area. We spoke a couple of weeks ago and he said this was a real problem.As soon as the money clears from the crowdfunding, we are going to buy loads of devices and second-hand refurbished ones and get them out to local schools around Leicester. If those kids haven#t got broadband and Wi-Fi, we will also be trying to work with companies to get dongles and access sorted.It is quite a local project, but it will make a big dference to those families. I have two kids of my own and it is hard enough as an ex-teacher even to motivate them to do home learning. I just can#t imagine what it is like for families with no devices, or maybe only one between three kids.The Northern Ireland connection to the project doesn#t end with Peter and Jackie, with the studio space for the gigs provided by Jon O#Neill - whose family is originally from Omagh - and his Yellow Bean Studios.Formerly gigging around Belfast in his student days, Peter explained having the chance to play to the virtual audience over the weekend has been a great buzz.It was brilliant being back in a room - albeit socially distanced - and seeing mates and colleagues, added Peter.Lots of the guys have lost out on touring and their careers have been put on hold. They continue to dig deep themselves and are so generous with their talent. Getting to play music again is fantastic. We#re delighted with the amount raised so far and the response to the gigs.Anyone wishing to donate to the BroadBand Aid project should visit: https:www.crowdfunder broadband-aidBelfast Most ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations at loyalist funeral DUP#s support takes a e in wake of Irish sea border rowMichael Stone#s gun used by IRA to kill babyCo Armagh woman accused of forcing man into sexual activity#We#re not out of the woods yet# as freezing weather s to NI againLatest EducationNI schools to take part in first ever Mental Health Festival Time for phased reopening of schools in Republic #approaching#, says health chiefDeluge of parents wanting kids to repeat year #a recipe for chaos#Controversial plans to merge three Co Down schools into new , pupil grammar school press aheadLatest from Belfast Bloody Sunday: low key memorial service heldMarkets boosted by miners enjoying Redditors piling into silverIran launches rocket capable of putting satellites in spaceWartime painting by Sir Winston Churchill to be sold at auctionLost police records will take ‘weeks’ to recover – top Home Office mandarin,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNew guidance on hauliers picking up multiple loads for transfer from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has been published By Michael McHugh, PAJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNew guidance on hauliers picking up mixed food loads for transfer from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has been published.The industry gave a cautious welcome to the Government advice.The Northern Ireland Protocol keeps the country in line with EU trade rules and animal products require special certication.A statement from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairssaid: “Freight volumes into Northern Ireland’s ports are at normal levels for this time of year and there have been no signicant queues.Our new approach to the movement of mixed food loads into Northern Ireland, known as groupage, is more flexible and gives businesses further options as to how they meet the required SPS checksDefra statement“We have always been clear that as the Northern Ireland Protocol is implemented we would work very closely with industry and DAERAto improve ways of operating.“Our new approach to the movement of mixed food loads into Northern Ireland, known as groupage, is more flexible and gives businesses further options as to how they meet the required SPSchecks and we will continue to offer our support to hauliers and suppliers as this beds in.”Agriculture departments in Northern Ireland and Great Britain have worked with hauliers to establish the new groupage model which will aid the movements of these loads into Northern Ireland.Following successful trials with industry involving taking goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, two groupage models have been agreed.Groupage means lorries in the rest of the UK picking up goods at multiple points for transit across the Irish Sea.It is a common method of reducing delivery costs for smaller retailers.Paperwork required due to the protocol had created problems with that because lorry containers were being opened and resealed multiple times.Defra proposed two models, one using “consolidation hubs” in which all mixed products arrived at one premises, were consolidated and certied as a single unit then sealed.Logistics UK is cautiously optimistic that the solution proposed will help prevent delaysAlex Veitch, Logistics UKThe other, known as a “linear model”, meant every inidual consignment like an inidual pallet would be checked and sealed by a certying officer before the haulier moved on to the next pick-up.The consolidated load would be sealed at the final point of dispatch before leaving for the port.Haulage industry body Logistics UK’s general manager of policy Alex Veitch said it followed pressure from the sector to ease the administrative burden after Brexit.He said: “Logistics UK is cautiously optimistic that the solution proposed will help prevent delays, by reducing the number of vehicles needing to be inspected on arrival in Northern Irelandadministered correctly.“The sector will continue to work closely with both Defra and DAERA as the scheme develops, because it is still untested for larger volumes of traffic and it is clear that further IT developments will be required as the system evolves.“As the scheme expands, it will be vital for government to work closely with Great Britain companies sending goods to Northern Ireland to ensure they are fully briefed on how to prepare groupage loads of SPS goods for Northern Ireland.”PAMost ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations

As that snow starts to fall as rain later on and falling on cold ground, it could turn to black ice and turn the snow rather slushy.This could cause further issues as we head into Tuesday evening and is likely to leave many untreated rural roads particularly troublesome for drivers and essential workers.The message is to take extra precautions. We always advise people to keep up-to-date and we do review the warnings regularly. The government advice at the moment is to keep all travel essential. Any journey that can be delayed by a day would be advisable and suggested.Moving beyond Tuesday, while it will briefly turn milder on Wednesday, there is still the potential for further wintry weather into Thursday and the weekend, with colder air ing from the north. More likely is that any precipitation will fall as rain. However, the risk of ice is likely to remain.The middle of the week and onwards will be temporarily less cold for a short time, but ing colder weather is expected for the end of the week and indeed into next weekend, added Mr Miall.We are definitely not out of the woods just yet with regard to winter weather.Belfast Most ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations at loyalist funeral Michael Stone#s gun used by IRA to kill babyDUP#s support takes a e in wake of Irish sea border rowCo Armagh woman accused of forcing man into sexual activity#We#re not out of the woods yet# as freezing weather s to NI againLatest Northern IrelandBloody Sunday: low key memorial service heldQuarter of a million doses of Covid vaccine administered in Northern IrelandBelfast man who swung metal chain at Asda security guards avoids prisonEU could have disrupted vaccine supply, NI health minister warnsStormont still waiting for Treasury green light on retaining Covid millionsLatest from Belfast Bloody Sunday: low key memorial service heldArmed forces ‘will do whatever is needed’ to support vaccination programmeIsle of Man residents ‘grateful’ but ‘cut off’ as circuit-breaker lockdown endsColombia outraged at death threat to -year-old environmental activistMorten Harket: I felt like a drunk crossing the M during The Masked Singer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More importantly, she was a mother to four children. But because she was not married those children were taken away from her. As penance she worked ‘slavishly’ in Derry’s Good Shepherd Home and Laundry for the next  years, according to her son Robert. He sought answers in the s but the nuns who brought him up dismissed those approaches telling him ‘you don’t need to know anything’. As a young boy those same nuns branded his mother a ‘mortal sinner’ while ordering him to clean toilets at St Joseph’s Home – better known as Termonbacca. googletag.cmd.push He learned nothing more of her whereabouts. Out of the blue, Mr O’Connor received a phone call in October  informing him that Bridget had died. A short time later he located a communal grave at Ardmore but his mother’s name did not appear on the headstone. ‘FALSE NAME’ After  years of service in the convent, the Catholic Church had organised her burial but somehow the wrong surname, Conway, was etched on the gravestone. This week, at Ardmore Cemetery with an umbrella in hand to shield him from the elements, Mr O’Connor walks to Bridget’s graveside. “My mother was buried under a  name so it makes me wonder are any of these names correct ” he ponders, “or has the Catholic Church intentionally been putting the wrong names on these headstones so that family members can’t find these women ” googletag.cmd.push When asked to correct the error the Catholic diocese refused saying it would be ‘too expensive’. Holding letters from the Church, he adds: “I found them very defensive, they didn’t want to know really. “They failed my mother in death as they failed her in le.” After legal proceedings were initiated the Church decided to act. He points to the gravestonewhere the wrong name was crudely removed.  The correct name was then added to the bottom of an adjacent headstone, upsetting the chronology of the women’s deaths in the process.  However, confusion remains over the spelling of her first name. On the headstone it is ‘Brigid’ but in correspondence from the Good Shepherd Sisters it was spelled Bridget.     It demonstrates how little information the family were given but Mr O’Connor believes the accurate spelling is Bridget. In contrast to the modest grave containing the  residents, more opulent headstones were erected in the cemetery to remember nuns who ran the Good Shepherd laundry. GRANDCHILDREN Mr O’Connor was the youngest of Bridget’s children and she became resident within the walls of the St Mary’s home following his birth. Along with his siblings, he was raised in a children’s home and feels that his status as the child of a Good Shepherd laundry woman led to his poor treatment in the home. This attitude was reflected in the nature of the duties the young boywas assigned in the home. Furthermore, during his childhood he was not informed that he had two brothers and a sister. In , as a young adult arranging his marriage, he applied for his birth certicate and began to ask questions about his mother. His inquiries were disregarded by the nuns. At the time Robert and his we Kathleen assumed his mother was dead but she didnt pass away until four years later. With sadness and regret, Mrs O’Connor says: “She couldve been at the wedding, she could have met her first grandchild before she passed away.” She points out that in death they were treated with the same contempt. “These women were made to wash the priest’s garments because thats what they thought of these women, that they were dirt, the fallen women who were only good for doing their laundry.” Mr O’Connor adds: “My mother worked in a laundry from the day I was born to the day she died. That’s what’s so annoying about it. She could have been helped, she needed help and they didn’t help her. “I think it was a money-making exercise, it was a business they were running, really, I don’t think it was a charity. “The only people who seemed to be benefitting was the nuns through the labour of the women, rather than helping them to get on their feet. “I don’t know how you explain it, whether Social Services could’ve established them in the community and get them more confidence to run their own lives.” QUESTIONS Once again Mr O’Connor wrote to the Good Shepherd Nuns to request information. He was told that she may have been referred to St. Mary’s Good Shepherd by Limavady Hospital in September  but that there was ‘no solid information in relation to this’. None of the Sisters who were in St. Mary’s when she was referred are now alive, it added. The solicitor acting on behalf of the Good Shepherd Sisters went on to say that the home was run for ‘older girls and women who had fallen into dficulties and often had nowhere  to go’. Mr O’Connor feels insulted by the ‘dismissive attitude’ adopted by the Good Shepherd nuns and Catholic Church. “They said she could leave any time she wanted, but how could she with four children taken from her and no home of her own,” he said in response. The Mother and Baby Homes research report published last week pointed out that the Good Shepherd Sisters closely guard the secrets and privacy of the women who passed through their mother and baby homes and laundries. In some respects this is commendable and it is clear that this is the wish of most women involved, the report said, but it is also the cause of distress to their families. In this case, as a result of the inadequate levels of communication about his mother, Mr O’Connor has been left to speculate about her le and how she came to enter the laundry. He is convinced the nuns did not want the family to find Bridget. “I’m just assuming that we weren’t allowed to be adopted, because she would not sign, and that’s why she was kept in there. “I can’t say that for a fact but that’s what I truly believe.” In reply nuns informed him that his mother was a ‘very happy and pleasant lady’ who made St. Mary’s her home and ‘at no point ever expressed a desire to leave’. They added that she was not there on foot of a court order. He found that dficult to comprehend as it made him feel like ‘she didn’t want me, and she was happy to be in there’. However, he is distrustful of this information and unwilling to accept it at face value. Moreover, a barrister told him that his mother might have thought it was necessary to work in the laundry to pay for the upkeep of her children in their Catholic residential homes. Mr O’Connor reflected on the impact his mother’s disappearance on his le and how the lack of communication from the Good Shepherd Sisters compounded his trauma.

More importantly, she was a mother to four children. But because she was not married those children were taken away from her. As penance she worked ‘slavishly’ in Derry’s Good Shepherd Home and Laundry for the next  years, according to her son Robert. He sought answers in the s but the nuns who brought him up dismissed those approaches telling him ‘you don’t need to know anything’. As a young boy those same nuns branded his mother a ‘mortal sinner’ while ordering him to clean toilets at St Joseph’s Home – better known as Termonbacca. googletag.cmd.push He learned nothing more of her whereabouts. Out of the blue, Mr O’Connor received a phone call in October  informing him that Bridget had died. A short time later he located a communal grave at Ardmore but his mother’s name did not appear on the headstone. ‘FALSE NAME’ After  years of service in the convent, the Catholic Church had organised her burial but somehow the wrong surname, Conway, was etched on the gravestone. This week, at Ardmore Cemetery with an umbrella in hand to shield him from the elements, Mr O’Connor walks to Bridget’s graveside. “My mother was buried under a  name so it makes me wonder are any of these names correct ” he ponders, “or has the Catholic Church intentionally been putting the wrong names on these headstones so that family members can’t find these women ” googletag.cmd.push When asked to correct the error the Catholic diocese refused saying it would be ‘too expensive’. Holding letters from the Church, he adds: “I found them very defensive, they didn’t want to know really. “They failed my mother in death as they failed her in le.” After legal proceedings were initiated the Church decided to act. He points to the gravestonewhere the wrong name was crudely removed.  The correct name was then added to the bottom of an adjacent headstone, upsetting the chronology of the women’s deaths in the process.  However, confusion remains over the spelling of her first name. On the headstone it is ‘Brigid’ but in correspondence from the Good Shepherd Sisters it was spelled Bridget.     It demonstrates how little information the family were given but Mr O’Connor believes the accurate spelling is Bridget. In contrast to the modest grave containing the  residents, more opulent headstones were erected in the cemetery to remember nuns who ran the Good Shepherd laundry. GRANDCHILDREN Mr O’Connor was the youngest of Bridget’s children and she became resident within the walls of the St Mary’s home following his birth. Along with his siblings, he was raised in a children’s home and feels that his status as the child of a Good Shepherd laundry woman led to his poor treatment in the home. This attitude was reflected in the nature of the duties the young boywas assigned in the home. Furthermore, during his childhood he was not informed that he had two brothers and a sister. In , as a young adult arranging his marriage, he applied for his birth certicate and began to ask questions about his mother. His inquiries were disregarded by the nuns. At the time Robert and his we Kathleen assumed his mother was dead but she didnt pass away until four years later. With sadness and regret, Mrs O’Connor says: “She couldve been at the wedding, she could have met her first grandchild before she passed away.” She points out that in death they were treated with the same contempt. “These women were made to wash the priest’s garments because thats what they thought of these women, that they were dirt, the fallen women who were only good for doing their laundry.” Mr O’Connor adds: “My mother worked in a laundry from the day I was born to the day she died. That’s what’s so annoying about it. She could have been helped, she needed help and they didn’t help her. “I think it was a money-making exercise, it was a business they were running, really, I don’t think it was a charity. “The only people who seemed to be benefitting was the nuns through the labour of the women, rather than helping them to get on their feet. “I don’t know how you explain it, whether Social Services could’ve established them in the community and get them more confidence to run their own lives.” QUESTIONS Once again Mr O’Connor wrote to the Good Shepherd Nuns to request information. He was told that she may have been referred to St. Mary’s Good Shepherd by Limavady Hospital in September  but that there was ‘no solid information in relation to this’. None of the Sisters who were in St. Mary’s when she was referred are now alive, it added. The solicitor acting on behalf of the Good Shepherd Sisters went on to say that the home was run for ‘older girls and women who had fallen into dficulties and often had nowhere  to go’. Mr O’Connor feels insulted by the ‘dismissive attitude’ adopted by the Good Shepherd nuns and Catholic Church. “They said she could leave any time she wanted, but how could she with four children taken from her and no home of her own,” he said in response. The Mother and Baby Homes research report published last week pointed out that the Good Shepherd Sisters closely guard the secrets and privacy of the women who passed through their mother and baby homes and laundries. In some respects this is commendable and it is clear that this is the wish of most women involved, the report said, but it is also the cause of distress to their families. In this case, as a result of the inadequate levels of communication about his mother, Mr O’Connor has been left to speculate about her le and how she came to enter the laundry. He is convinced the nuns did not want the family to find Bridget. “I’m just assuming that we weren’t allowed to be adopted, because she would not sign, and that’s why she was kept in there. “I can’t say that for a fact but that’s what I truly believe.” In reply nuns informed him that his mother was a ‘very happy and pleasant lady’ who made St. Mary’s her home and ‘at no point ever expressed a desire to leave’. They added that she was not there on foot of a court order. He found that dficult to comprehend as it made him feel like ‘she didn’t want me, and she was happy to be in there’. However, he is distrustful of this information and unwilling to accept it at face value. Moreover, a barrister told him that his mother might have thought it was necessary to work in the laundry to pay for the upkeep of her children in their Catholic residential homes. Mr O’Connor reflected on the impact his mother’s disappearance on his le and how the lack of communication from the Good Shepherd Sisters compounded his trauma. Many questions remain unanswered for him: “Why she was in there so long  What did they do to help her  Was it just for the benefit of the nuns to get free work…”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The clubs senior, minor and U teams had qualied for their respective county finals, only for the competitions to be frozen after a second outbreak of Covid- which led to the GAA pulling down the curtain on the club season. In an interview in the County Derry Post, to mark being voted as Club of the Year in the papers GAA awards scheme, Kidd acknowledged the need to comply with Covid- restrictions but deemed the club as being unlucky. The Martins were junior champions in , before winning their only senior title three years later. In , they won their second junior title, but despite getting to seven intermediate deciders, glory eluded them at this grade. googletag.cmd.push A one-point defeat to Craigbane was their only flaw in the group stages and after a facile win over Doire Colmcille in the last eight, they were semi-final winnersover Ballerin. Then, with days to go until their final showdown with Craigbane, the GAA pressed pause on the club season. “It was left hanging,” Kidd remembers. “There was frustration, regret and a bit of everything...it was a real downer. The whole club was deflated when we got the news and we didnt get the news until Thursdaythat it wasnt going to be played.” “It was cruel on the players, for what they went through, youre in a county final and suddenly its not on.” googletag.cmd.push The minors were through to the C final, where they were due to play neighbours Ballinascreen. The Us were also looking forward to their final, after a quarter-final win over Claudy and an epic - to - semi-final win over Greenlough. “Despite the disappointment of not getting to play the final at the time and irrespectiveit’s ever played I can honestly say that we could not be any prouder of this group of lads,” stated U coach John Murtagh. After their recent efforts with their underage development it was a disappointing end to a season that promised so much.     “The Us, Us and seniors were playing in their respective county finals in the same year, any club wouldve given their right arm for the like of that,” said Kidd. “We got the buzz, then we didnt get it and thats the way it is. “We are in limbo. Wed love to see the two underage finals – U and minor – played. They are young and can adapt to any type of thing.” Kidd admits there are dferent feelings around the club about their seniors junior final clash with Craigbane. “Some are of the feelings would be to share it and forget about it until next year ,” he explains. “That is some of the feeling, because the euphoria and the buzz has gone. How do you build to play a final before you even play a league match  You just cant do it.” For now, it is a case of sit and wait. Kidd was in contact with the county board and their thoughts wouldve been to play it in the pre-season of . He acknowledges how dficult it is for fixture administrators to know how things will pan out. Kidd feels it couldend up with a  winner with teams not being ready or prepared. “Lets go and win it the proper way,” he feels. “We do appreciate the Covid- pandemic, we are living up to the regulations and we appeal to everyone to do that. “We are at an unlucky stage in history. One of our best years has been torn away from us.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr McGinley set up a small steering committee in  to fundraise before officially opening the Foyle Hospice in the city in  and, since that opening, the deeply-valued palliative care centre has been a source of great comfort and assistance to thousands of families across not only the city, but the entire district. Dr McGinley was honoured for his selfless and le-changing work by Derry City Council in  when he was awarded the prestigious Freedom of Derry. googletag.cmd.push He also received a papal knighthood from Pope John Paul II in  and has a sculpture in his honour in St Columbs Park. Mayor Tierney said his thoughts were with Dr McGinleys children Ciaran, Aisling, Ronan and Sinead, and his extended family and friends. I was deeply saddened today to learn of the news of Dr McGinleys passing, a man who has had such a profound effect on the lives of acountless number of families across our district and the wider North West region. It was after an encounter with a young man with terminal cancer that Dr McGinley pursued the idea of opening a palliative care facility in the city, and we are all immensely grateful for his determination, dedication and passion in following through and opening the Foyle Hospice. googletag.cmd.push Dr McGinley has left a legacy on this city and its people that will last for generations to come and we know that his vision will continue to be delivered by the hard-working team at Foyle Hospice. The Freedom of Derry was one of many deserving honours that Dr McGinley received but for him thats not what it was about – he wanted to help as many people and as many families as he could through some of their toughest days. My thoughts and prayers are with Dr McGinleys children, his wider family circle and his many friends. I hope that they can take some comfort in knowing how deeply loved and appreciated he was by all across this city, district and region.

He has represented Ireland in multiple events over recent years and has quietly built up a reputation as one of the finest runners to come from the city.Eamon, a runner himself, decided to combine his passion of athletics and cinema, and, taking the skills he has learned working with McMatic Media, has directed and produced his first documentary.It has been a labour of love over the past two years for the -year-old.“Myself and my friend Paul Gormley, who is a producer alongside me on the project, went to Vienna to see Eliud Kipchoge break the two-hour barrier,” he explained.“We were going to make a film about running in general but when we were in Vienna we saw that it wasn’t really what we were looking for, so we talked about it and decided that instead of starting out globally, for our first film we would take it back home and start local.“One of the main characters in the film is Malcolm McCausland who is a real character in the film. We went to his house one night and talked about who we should make the film about. He said Conor was the man because he was a humble guy who has a great story about someone who wanted to represent Ireland internationally. He always showed great potential but once he hit really good form he would get injured, so it was about shining some light on him. The further I got into it, I studied Conor and realised that there was this wealth of archive spread across Ireland.“I rang Conor and asked himhe would be interested in an independent documentary and he said he would, which is where it was conceived.”Eamon’s approach to the film has evolved from that first trip to Vienna and that first conversation with Conor, and whilst the Spartan is the focus, the story is also about Derry itself and the impact of running in Ireland.“When I really honed in on it, I wanted to make the story Derry-based,” Eamon admitted.“The story is just as much about Derry and Ireland as it is about Conor. I started filming with Conor and then the story started to develop.“Conor had that summer when he ran in the Morton Games in Cork and was the fastest guy over m, running sub- which was the first time in  years that someone from Derry did that. He ultimately ends up running in the European Athletics Cross-Country.“Because his story expanded, I was able to follow him and show the European Athletics Association what I was doing.“They could see that I was doing it at a professional level so they allowed me their archive. They gave me unbelievable footage, so the story really expands at the end – it’s not just about Conor.” googletag.cmd.push  Film FestivalsOnce the film is complete, it will be entered into the Cork and Galway Film Festivals in the hope of being accepted.“It’s been quite the journey,” he stated.“It’s just under two years since I started. If it gets traction it might be later this year when we’ll be able to share it. I’m really excited about sharing it online. For me I want to go the professional route. I’ve invested my own money into this. No-one would help us, no-one would back us. It was just an idea.”The entire product is almost exclusively local and Eamon admits he could not have made it this far without a dedicated team.“It is home made,” he emphasises. “The music composed in it is very obvious and prominent and that’s by Composer James Curran. He’s done an unbelievable amount of work and he is someone who people should keep an eye on.“Colm Herron, who is Cameraman and Producer, went to Barcelona with me to film. Caoimhe Sweeney, who has a full other story herself, is a great artist. Her artwork is outstanding.“Jason Bonner also did fabulous work with the animation, while Fiachra OLongain was on nd Camera. There is a wealth of talent in it. The Derry creatives really came together and my friends really helped me bring it to fruition.“I’m just excited about it. We’ve needed a lot of patience during these teams but we’ve just been quietly working away and Conor has been amazing. The whole running community has also been amazing, so many of them have reached out.“When it’s released, I think it will just be a nice piece for the running community and for Conor. He is a really humble guy who doesn’t promote himself. All those nights he was out running, it will just be nice to see that. He has a lot more to come as well.”The challenges brought about by Covid- were unexpected but ultimately manageable for Eamon and his team, and they were finally able to show their work to Conor himself, ahead of the big realse later on this year.“It was scary showing it to Conor because we didn’t show him anything for a year,” Eamon laughed. “Fortunately his reaction was very positive.“Once that happened I could just enjoy it more. On the technical side, I’ve shown some other directors and they have given me good feedback for some tweaks. It’s exciting.“ It’s very much a Derry film and it will be nice to have Conor and Derry on the map for athletics.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I suppose with the first lockdown, things were definitely easier. It was spring, coming into summer, we all had the good weather and there was a novelty to it really. Now though, it has been slightly tougher. But listen, overall I canrsquot complain at all. Irsquom still in training, working in football too, so I am very lucky I have that.CB: How did you find things at the start of lockdown because there did appear to be some ambiguity as to whether the Irish League players could be classed as elite athletes and continue playing  That must have been confusing and unsettling AW: It was a strange one no doubt. Certainly everyone involved in the Irish League, especially at Premiership level, strives to be elite. A lot of us are full-time. I have certainly no problem with the extra training that comes with that and the extra work.But the players do need to be subject to regular testing for Covid-. It is counter-productive to what we, as a society, are trying to do in terms of curtailing this disease otherwise.There has been a lot of ambiguity, but certainly I havenrsquot encountered a player who didnrsquot want to be playing. But obviously we are all concerned that we are able to do so in as safe a manner as possible.At the end of the day, after a match or a training session, we are all going back to loved ones and people who may be vulnerable too. We want to ensure they are as protected as possible.CB: In terms of your role and your standing now at Linfield, you would be considered to be one of the veterans of the side, but you still seem as hungry as ever for goals and success.AW: Absolutely, and in many ways you know that has been the case even more since the first lockdown. At that stage I had so much on with my work with the Irish FA, I probably didnrsquot have the time I would have liked to have dedicated to my own football.But certainly you can see the dference it makes to your season and your ability to hit the ground runningyou do get that good pre-season base in.I was doing my own fitness work in the house during the lockdown.I embrace where I am at now in my career and my age. But I am fortunate in that sense. I know a lot of people who get to my stage and they basically dread retirement. I am  now, so I suppose you do think about when retirement will come.Over the past while, as one of the more senior players at Linfield, I have been able to take on more, I suppose, of that advisory role to younger players. You know those younger guys coming to me asking me about fitness programmes, looking for advice about clubs and things like that, it is great.I am still, believe it or not, learning about the game. I am adapting my role on the pitch too as I move into this latter phase of my playing career. Sometimes you have to do that.But I am going back to foundations and in many ways that has really helped my form this season.Things like learning about playing more with your back to goal, how to use that to your advantage. It is something I have really enjoyed and as I say, embraced.CB: You have played under many of the top managers in the Irish League during your time. David Healy, another local figure at the club like yourself, obviously went into the Linfield job very much managerially as a rookie, although having of course achieved so much as a player. How would you rate him as a manager and indeed how he has made that switch from the pitch to the dugout AW: David I know, never really foresaw becoming a manager. He would tell you that himself. What I do notice about him is, despite everything he achieved, he never talks about his playing days. He is a huge Linfield supporter and he is results-driven. Make no mistake though, he rules with an iron fist.He expects very high standards. It is the job of the players who are there to win. Thatrsquos it, no excuses. Dferent managers bring dferent attributes to any job. But certainly with David,you fall below his standard, you will know.With playing under the like of David Jeffrey, he is a very dferent case. He loved to create that whole ethos of lsquoeverbody hates Linfieldrsquo, and I guess tap into that siege mentality side of things.DJ I suppose, would have been a bit more touchy-feely with the players than perhaps David Healy. Jeffrey would have brought the players to the side, and had the little one-to-one man management conversations with them.But I will say working with David [Healy], especially as he himself was a striker, has taken my game to a whole dferent level since I have been working with him. There is never a comfort zone at Linfield mdash that is the big thing. That has been a key part of my longevity I believe. You constantly have to be kicking on at Linfield. Anyone who coasts at Linfield, they donrsquot last long.CB: Casting your mind back to your days with Kilmore Rec, how much do you think the Amateur League and Kilmore helped you in terms of being ready for the steps up you made AW: Thatrsquos a really good question. The Amateur League is a brilliant springboard for then moving on to the Irish League. You play real first team football. As a player, you can sometimes spend too long at bigger clubsrsquo academies.I had been at the Glentoran academy for a while before I went back to Kilmore for first team football. I was lucky at that time with the Kilmore first team that was there. I played with boys like Gary Curran, Paul Smyth, Joe McMahon.They were players who wanted to win so badly, they played fair, but they played hard. I went into Duck [Donal] Bellrsquos team just as the club were going on a great Irish Cup run that season. That gave me a complete love for the game.But I quickly got to the stage where I didnrsquot just want to do two days a week with my football. Donrsquot get me wrong, the Amateur League, Premier Section is a good standard. As a footballing family, there is a lot for us to be proud of with the Amateur League.Obviously at the moment, all the clubs at that standard are in such a dficult place, but a good club at that level serves a purpose in so many ways, especially for the community. For clubs like Kilmore, and indeed all those playing at that level, it is a real tragedy that there is no football being played at the moment.CB: You are also heavily involved in the coaching side of things with your work with the IFA. Is coaching something you think you might be interested in post-playing, and indeed do you want to remain in football when you hang the boots up AW: I am definitely at the stage now I suppose where I am asking myself how can I remain in the game. It is without doubt something I want to do, to stay in football. But it is about working out exactly in what role that would be best for me.I suppose I have been able to work on a bit of a niche thing for myself with the Irish FA with a coaching and education role. I have done a bit of work with Gerard Lyttle with the Northern Ireland under-age teams and that has been something I have really enjoyed. It is great to see the progress of the younger boys through the dferent age levels with Northern Ireland.CB: You made the move for a time to Hamilton and were up against the top teams in Scotland. How was playing over there for you AW: It is funny you ask about that. My uncle only last night was asking me about all that is happening with Celtic at the moment. When I was there in Scotland you had boys like James McCarthy, Leigh Grfiths, James Forrest all up-and-coming and you could tell easily at that stage that they were boys who were going places. It is definitely a better standard of football in Scotland than a of people realise. I remember when I moved to Hamilton from Lisburn Distillery, I had played for Distillery on the Tuesday night, and then the move to Hamilton picked up momentum quickly.All of a sudden, come the Sunday of that week, there I was playing for Hamilton at Aberdeen in a Scottish Cup game in front of , people. I have to be honest, maybe I was a bit young at the time, maybe the home sickness got the better of me, but I do regret that I came home from Scotland again so soon.I have regretted it every day. You donrsquot want to let the like of that eat away at you, but I was there. I was rubbing shoulders with the gamersquos best.If I could go back and relive that experience again, I would do it in a heartbeat. But you donrsquot want to dwell on it, otherwise it could destroy you.I trained as hard as anyone over there. Maybe I would say compared to others at that standard, I struggled technically. You can get so down on yourself but when you are younger. For me, the chance came too early.It was the last day of the January transfer window when I made the move to Scotland. It actually looked for a long time that Irsquod be going to Aberdeen. However, that fell through at the last minute. I went to Hamilton then, but unfortunately it was just the wrong club for me.I did have chances again to go across the water. When Warren Feeney got the Newport job, he wanted me to go across there, but it wasnrsquot right for me. Everyone has a dferent journey. I was a late developer.Football is a tough place. People watch the Premier League and think that is what it is all about, but in many ways that is not the real picture of what football is, the glamour that is seemingly there. It is so tough to crack the code across the water.It is especially dficult for an Irish kid. If it is an English kid at an English club or a Scottish youngster at a Scottish club, they can easily go back and forth to their family, and alleviate that home-sickness.You canrsquot have thatyou are an Irish kid over there as easily. It can be lonely at times, and it is tough there is no doubt.CB: When you look at Scottish football this season, and particularly in the Premiership for Celtic and Rangers, there has been a complete transformation in fortunes and that in the season when Celtic have been chasing that historic ten-in-a-row. Has the role-reversal between the two Glasgow sides surprised you AW: There is no doubt, the change has been really drastic. I never imagined, despite how much Steven Gerrard has improved Rangers that the gap would be this big, particularly this early in the season.I know Michael Beale, a coach at Rangers from working at the IFA. He is a methodical coach, leaves nothing to chance, and I have no doubt he will have had a big role on the success Rangers are enjoying on the pitch at the moment. Gerrard has done a great job of getting that Rangers back four shored up.But things go wrong. For Celtic, I have no doubt they have found it dficult playing without fans.They definitely feed off the atmosphere that is usually generated by the supporters at Celtic Park.And the Dubai trip has been a really unwanted distraction that has not helped them at all.I do believe however for Celtic it can be a quick turn-around. I donrsquot necessarily see that they will now have to wait years for another Scottish title, the way in which it has been so long since Rangers last won it.Celtic can dust themselves down. Football can be so fluid. That is one of the great things about it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch named Irish club of the year by writers  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH RFC have been voted as the best rugby club in Ireland.The club was named Club of the Year by the Guinness Rugby Writers of Ireland Club of the Year.The club won the accolade for its outstanding community outreach work during the Covid- lockdown.This community spirit, said the Rugby writers, was nurtured from mini rugby players through to the seniors.Club chairman James Kirk said everyone at the club was delighted with the award.We are obviously very pleased. We have known about getting the award for a while before it was actually made public knowledge, so it has been in the pipeline, he remarked.ldquoWe are very proud that what it represents especially is our work with community engagement.

It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it.ldquoWersquove noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.Just one hour every year for the past four decades has made the RSPBrsquos big garden birdwatch the worldrsquos largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted.Last yearrsquos results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the big garden birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens.Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  mdash house sparrows followed by starlings mdashstarlings were the most-spotted birds in Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry, ahead of house sparrows, while Fermanaghrsquos number one bird was the chaffinch.The Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world and while house sparrows and starlings may be the UKrsquos most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at the data shows that numbers have ped dramatically since the birdwatch began in .House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %.Itrsquos also a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.To sign up for the for the big garden birdwatch visit www.rspb.org.uk birdwatch while to learn more about RSPB NIrsquos work log on at www.rspb.org.uk nireland  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit trading with Great Britain ‘complete nightmare’%2C says owner  ","story":"THE impact of Brexit and the Irish Sea border is impacting on one of the districtrsquos most popular garden centres.Beth Lunney mdash who runs the Saintfield Nursery Centre along with her family mdash has described the impact of the most signicant change to trading in decades and one that will affect many businesses.She said changes became apparent in November, just weeks before the UK formally left the EU.As part of the garden centrersquos preparations for the new sea border it, had signed up to the governmentrsquos Trader Support Service, with Beth also liaising with her suppliers in England.Her longstanding supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons got in touch and revealed that he was not going to be able to get the delivery to Saintfield, explaining that it was because of the possibility that there could be soil in the pots.The UK supplier had correctly interpreted the new rules which apply on trade in plants between Great Britain and Northern Ireland which is still in the EUrsquos plant health system and therefore must apply EU rules on products entering from Great Britain.Plants now need a plant health certicate to enter the country, but some products are completely banned, including soil as it can carry pests and diseases, but there maybe even more problems ahead.Beth said it was being suggested in some quarters that there may be an issue with pallets and even wooden handled forks and spades coming into Northern Ireland due to Brexit and the Irish Sea border and even delays in getting wooden furniture which she currently has on order.In the wake of Bethrsquos UK supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons getting in touch, her rose supplier subsequently got in contact via email to confirm that he would not be able to supply roses which had been on order since the autumn for planned deliveries throughout the season.ldquoThe problem is the peat reduced compost they use along with wood fibre and bark to pot up the roses, Beth explained, expressing sympathy for her suppliers.ldquoThe growers in GB are in a terrible position. They cannot take a chance and send plants to us as they may be delayed at our new border. A plant, like food, is perishable and a delivery could be taken and destroyed. Who will be willing to take that chance  I guess no one.Beth said Northern Ireland has the same climate as the rest of Great Britain and plants that do well there will also do well here, explaining that the local nursery is more selective about taking plants from Europe.She said the new regulations were not just a challenge for Saintfield Nurseries, but the entire Northern Ireland horticultural industry.The new reality for some businesses is that it has become easier to get key supplies from the EU, with Beth explaining that she already gets part of her stock from the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland and that this may have to increase.She said that several nurseries in the Republic of Ireland are emailing the Saintfield business saying theyrsquore going to have roses, but they may not be the particular ieties that they really want.Beth added: ldquoWe were told we would leave the EU as one country, the UK. We have been badly let down by all those that govern us. We should be equal to Scotland, Wales and England all of us members of the United Kingdom, but sadly now this is not the case.ldquoOne of my suppliers in England who contacted me last Friday thought there would be no problem supplying us but now the whole Northern Ireland and Brexit issue is a complete nightmare.The Horticultural Trades Associationis also lobbying the government, urging it to work with the EU to explore ways to ease the new rules.ldquoThe impact of these complex and burdensome changes is far-reaching for GB and NI, said the organisationrsquos chairman James Barnes, warning that the UKrsquos horticulture industry stands to lose outsolutions cannot be found..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Centennial.jpg","title":"Centennial celebrations event by Spa Wells LOL  ","story":"MEMBERS of Spa Wells LOL  kicked off their year long celebrations of the Centennial of Northern Ireland with a hike up Slieve Croob on New Yearrsquos Day.Crisp clear weather afforded enchanting views stretching to neighbouring Scotland and England.A poem was written to commemorate the occasion.On Slieve Croobrsquos lofty mountain peak:We placed our flag todayTo give a message to the worldThat we are here to stayOne hundred years have come and goneOur motto is the sameThe Union is our safeguardAnd this we will maintain.The members plan more exciting and interestingprojects throughout the year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Student.jpg","title":"Cormac secures place at prestigious Harvard University  ","story":"A TEENAGER will be swapping Downpatrick for Hard University later this year.Cormac Savage is the first pupil from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School to be offered a place at the world famous American university.Seventeen year-old Cormac, who is head boy at St Patrickrsquos, says itrsquos a dream come true to be given an opportunity to study at what is regarded as one of the top universities in the world.Hersquos also grateful to his family and the teachers at St Patrickrsquos, including the principal, Mr Joe McCann, for encouraging him to apply in the first place.Hard is one of the fabled lsquoIvy Leaguersquo universities in the United States and Cormac was one of , students to apply for a place, of which only seven per cent were successful.ldquoWhile Irsquod always wanted to study in the USA, it wasnrsquot until a year ago I seriously considered Hard, he said.ldquoIt was always my dream university but I was convinced I wouldnrsquot get in.

I have made up my mind to go abroad to work and I think a lot of other students will do that as well.The Nursing and Midwery Council , the registration body for nurses, recently extended its Emergency Standards to allow final year nursing students to undertake paid clinical placements in order to support the existing nursing workforce during the pandemic.While this has been introduced in England, Scotland and Wales, Robin Swann has declined to implement them into Northern Ireland.In early December, the Department of Health said a joint statement from the NMC and UK chief nursing officers explained that students would not be put into paid placements, as happened earlier during the pandemic.The statement said that instead, employing health trusts would protect their status as supernumerary students and continue to support them through high quality placements, which is a fundamental aspect of pre-registration nurse training.South Down MP Chris Hazzard is supporting the call from Eimear and other final year nursing students.He added: ldquoThese nurses are working at the front line and saving lives. Paying them would allow them to be able to support themselves.ldquoI am calling on the health minister to pay these nurses and to also increase the student nurse bursary as a recognition of the fantastic work student nurses are doing in the fight against Covid-..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-CDiary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 24%2C 2001  ","story":"KILLINCHY ndash The owners of a Killinchy factory, which could close its doors with the loss of  jobs, have this week been accused of playing mind games with staff.Trade union officials and shop stewards are furious with the owners of the Carpets International plant for their continued refusal to come clean about its future.And at a time when staff are unsuretheir jobs are secure, they have been asked by their bosses to increase their weekly productivity.A crucial board meeting planned for Bradford last week to discuss the Killinchy plantrsquos future role was cancelled at the eleventh hour and company officials have been accused of ldquohiding behind a wall of silence.More than  of the staff employed in Killinchy live in Down District and they believe their jobs could be on the line as the plantrsquos American owners press ahead with a major restructuring plan which will result in a number of its factories being downsized and closed.Workers fear the local plant will be axed in a bid to save costs amid claims that the parent company is poundm in debt.

He has performed the role of club chairman, with his playing reduced to part-time due to the fact he suffers from arthritis in a finger.He has played for Drumaroad in the past, and in more recent seasons for the former top club in Downpatrick, De La Salle.Back in the days of the Lecale Leaguersquos Spin magazine, which was edited by the late and sadly-missed Gerry Carson, Jim provided lsquoPeople in the Newsrsquo and lsquoAt your Servicersquo on a regular basis.This was back in the late s. Starting in  he produced another magazine named Equipment Plus.At this stage, he was running his Table Tennis Servicesfrom his home in Castlewellan. However, as many will recall, for some years he ran Northern Irelandrsquos only table tennis shop in Irish Street, Downpatrick. He had a steady line of customers from near and far who came to make their purchases.As all local players will of course know, Jim is the local man to go to for advice on what rubber suits inidual players.As one who has made use of his help and advice on many occasions, it is quite common to arrive in Strangford to play a match, or indeed in another local hall, and find Jim replacing rubbers.He has also given people from ious local halls advice and has moved many on to pimpled rubbers in recent years, saving them money. A good many seasons back, Jim, anxious to give some of the Strangford clubrsquos younger players a bit of extra publicity, wrote reports for the Down Recorder.As a close associate to the long-time secretary of the Lecale League, Pat Morgan, there was never any doubt who would replace Pat when he sadly passed away.Since taking over, he has certainly done his utmost to keep the league going. He has brought in new clubs and written regular and well-received reports, as well as travelling to matches to take team photos.As well as being a great supporter of the Lecale League over many years, he has also been a great supporter of the East Down Churches League.He has attended and made donations for the leaguersquos annual charity cup match, as well as being present at their annual presentation evening.While Jim has been in regular action in recent seasons, he has proven that while form is temporary, class is permanent.When called upon to help a local team out in the Belfast  District League, he has been the only player on the team to win a game.As well as being a title-winning player, he has also proven he is a superb organiser as those that have attended the Lecale Leaguersquos th and th anniversary evenings know.In fact, so many turned up at the th anniversary event that lsquohouse fullrsquo notices had to go up.He even ran out of anniversary mugs for those who had played in the league over the years.While the Lecale League may not have as many teams as it did had in the past, the fact that it is still going is mainly thanks to Jim.It is also worth noting that with his guidance, the many charity tournaments he runs every season have raised a lot of money for Marie Curie and provided some great action for players.It is thanks to Jim and the late Pat Morgan that the league has been going now for over  years.

Even before the pandemic hit last year, wersquod got to a point where we were considering closing. Then the pandemic happened and we knew that it wasnrsquot the right time. We just had to keep going.ldquoAfter Christmas we knew we all needed to have time for ourselves and our families as we realised that so much of our own lives were being out on hold doing the voluntary work. Mum is also getting older, shersquos  now, and we just felt that we had done as much as we could.She stressed that all counselling sessions promised would continue they were complete.ldquoWe have been family run on a voluntary basis and due to the generosity of the local community, we were able to pay up to three therapists at any given time with no waiting time for those in distress or despair, added Brenda.She said that while the lockdown had presented challenges to the group regarding fund-raising and provision of support, counselling work continued through Zoom.ldquoTherersquos been some great fund-raising and we have been truly grateful but we just felt it was time to step back.Brenda said that while she hope that others may well organise and take over the gap that PIPS Downpatrickrsquos closure may leave, she felt that local mental health provision had moved on since the group started.ldquoWe would hope that the statutory services run by the Trust will continue. There are now mental health social workers in all the surgeries, yet  years ago you wouldnrsquot have heard of this, she added.Brenda said that while her family was sad at the closure, they were all very proud of what they had achieved with the help of the local community.ldquoWe truly believe we have saved lives and while it has been challenging at times, I wouldnrsquot have missed it for the world.

In , the  gained two million new members worldwide per month.The Strava team wrote in the report: ldquoAt the global level, the Covid- pandemic resulted in a rise of activity on Strava like wersquove never seen before, far surpassing our normal projections.In the UK, from March to May, members logged  per cent more outdoor activities than would be expected for that time of year, making the UK the most active global nation for outdoor activity.Alison continued: ldquoIt was a very bad year for everyone last year, and unfortunately this year has started in much the same way. With running though, it is one of those sports that is still accessible to us to take part in.When the regulations on sporting activity took hold, Alison said she and other members of the club were fastidious in following them to the letter.ldquoWe took our directive closely from Sport NI. We were able to develop a training plan that our members could follow inidually in January, and our members, because of the fact they are associated with the club, are particularly stringent about following the protocols as they should be done.ldquoRunning is something that can still be done outside, safely, and at a distance. Unless, for example you are running in a train of people, in these times, it is still a relatively low-risk activity. Both our sport and cycling have been able to proceed relatively well in terms of participation numbers.ldquoAnd from a mental health perspective, it offers so much. It has been a terrible time, for everybody for months with everything that has been happening. People have lost their lives, their loved ones, their livelihoods, running can be a nice outlet to just get away from things for that short time.Things may still be in limbo now in terms of planning any sporting activities locally in the district, but East Down AC members are still keeping their fingers crossed that the year ahead can still be one which will become more positive the longer into it we get.ldquoThis time last year, we would have had all our members training a lot, said Alison. ldquoThis year of course, we are not able to offer that. The Jimmyrsquos K is obviously a big event traditionally in the local athletics calendar, but that can attract around  runners. At the moment, it is just too dicy to even entertain that we could host that.ldquoHowever, we havenrsquot given up hope that we can still have some action to speak of later in the year with events. We would urge our members to keep training, keep themselves ready for when things can come back.ldquoWe know there are people out there who are naturally struggling with how things are. However people are there for you. The amount of virtual contact we all now have is something to embrace in these times. We have found we can even run a virtual league, which is something.Alison is hopeful that normal service can be resumed soon, as for many it is a huge leline to be a member of a running club.ldquoSome people are solitary. They may live alone, or work long hours alone. For those people, coming to the club to train, is as important in terms of getting face-to-face company with others.ldquoThese are the type of runners who donrsquot come to win the medals, they donrsquot come with winning as being the most important thing. It is about that human connection.ldquoDefinitely when I look around the town in Downpatrick, I can see more people out running, especially around the Quoile River and on the streets.ldquoRunning is a great outlet.

That said, the Board and management are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.ldquoThe Board and management ask the parents of pupils, past pupils and members of the public impacted by these proposals to make their voices heard by participating in the consultation process. This is a matter for the entire community ndash not just those directly involved in education.The statement continued: ldquoFor over  years, St Patrickrsquos [the Red High] has been at the heart of the local community as a centre of learning, a resource hub and as an active contributor to civic le.ldquoPupils, past and present, have made and continue to make signicant contributions in the fields of sport, art, music, business and public service.ldquoThe motivation of the Board of Governors and management of the school is to ensure the widest range of parental and pupil choice remains available in the East Down region.Last December, the chairman of the Board of Governors, Dr Aidan Hamill, lost an application to the High Court for a judicial review questioning the Department of Educationrsquos authority to go ahead with the proposal before securing agreement from its governors.Under the merger plan the new school would educate girls and boys aged - with an admission of  pupils per year, with up to a maximum of % of pupils admitted through academic selection.Grammar schools in Northern Ireland normally admit students exclusively through academic selection.It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The closure of the three schools will also mean the loss of distinctive local school unorms as well as requiring all teaching and support staff to reapply for jobs at the proposed new school.The controversial amalgamation has been put forward by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the De La Salle Congregation, who are the trustees of all three schools.St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School have declined to comment this week.However, both schools previously welcomed the proposed amalgamation, which originally included merging St Columbarsquos College in Portaferry.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle, said in December that he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He said at the time: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, principal of St Maryrsquos, said last September that the merger reflected her values and belief in all-ability schools.She said: ldquoIn terms of social justice, I feel the move is very important.

There is also a busy local authority garage and depot and a private care nursing home, with this section of road governed by a mph limit.Residents say that the overwhelming majority of drivers who

Downpatrick area of .% and that the new initiative is working.Mr McGrath said that when he and his SDLP colleague initially floated the idea of erecting the speed indicator signs, the feedback was that the such a scheme would not be efficient and would be too expensive, with little reward.He insists that confirmation that in the Downpatrick area alone speeds have reduced by .% in the short time the devices have been in place vindicates their installation.ldquoWhile John and I are delighted to hear that speeds are reducing across the district, we are in no way complacent about this.ldquoThe fact that the PCSP is doubling the provision of speed indicator signs is not only an indication of their efficacy, but also highlights the continued need for them.However, Mr McGrath said he was

speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoCombining this with infrastructure minister Nichola Mallonrsquos scheme for mph zones at  schools across the country can only help safety on

the Newcastle Centre to be invested at the Downs Road.ldquoGiven that the local authority is surveying what people would like to see provided, it is essential that they respond.Cllr Clarke hopes people will engage in the consultation process, emphasising the need toensure that all-ability equipment will feature in the upgraded play park to cater for children with special needs.He added: ldquoThe views and opinions of children, young people and communities are highly important to the local council and will provide the organisation with an opportunity to actively participate in the process of improving play experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12265068.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads

Northern Ireland however has been hit by major disruption to trade within the UK, including, it now emerges, movements of military equipment. These are not concerns in which NI can be used as a device to influence the outcome of a bigger disagreement, but relevant to the protocol.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The second key point that Lord Dodds makes relates to the hypocrisy of an EU which for four years agreed with the Irish that there could be no change whatsover at the Irish land border, not even CCTV. Then, when it suited them, they discarded this position and acted aggressively, swtly and without the slightest concern for a sudden hardening of the border. A third key point in the article is that the EU have not taken using Article  off the table.A fourth is that these truths about what the EU has just done cannot be swept under the carpet.The response of the UK government has been diplomatic rather than robust. It depicts itself as unionist, yet has presided over great damage to the NI-Great Britain Union.The essay by Lord Dodds is welcome but this is not just a story of bad EU conduct. It is also a story of London’s failures.Calling out Boris Johnson is not of itself going to change someone so brazen. Yet it could cause the government, which is more focused on saving Scotland than NI, occasionally to pause. The UK will certainly not break up prior to  but it would be embarrassing even to be seen to have set the Union on a path to destruction. Unionists acting asthe border was fine would please London and make the next concession all the easier, so Lord Dodds is right to emphasise how bad it is. • Nigel Dodds: Westminster must stand up to Brussels to help NI• Letter: Ulster Unionists should lead the charge against the NI protocol• Letter: DUP will have to be responsible for leading unionism through this crisis• Ben Lowry: At last, clear reason for UK and unionists to stop being weak towards Ireland and the EU——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIN our bridge improvers sessions, we are continuing to deal with opening two bids, playing Benjy Acol.Here is a hand with a big point count that requires careful bidding to reach the right contract.The AuctionNorth has a hand with twenty-three points. So, playing Benjy Acol, North opens two diamonds. This shows at least nine tricks in hand or a balanced twenty-three points plus. It is forcing to game. Her partner, South, with only four points bids two hearts, which asks North, her partner, to show what she has. With a balanced hand North bids two no trumps. South now knows that between them they have more than the magic twenty-five points required to play three no trumps.But hold on a minute, whatNorth has five hearts  Four hearts would then surely be a better contract than three no trumps. So, as with last weekrsquos hand, the correct bid by South is now three clubs - five card puppet Stayman - asking Northshe has a four or five card major. North bids three hearts, showing her five-card heart suit. South now bids four hearts, as she knows that they have eight hearts and at least twenty-seven points between them. This is indeed the best contract, as three no trumps makes, but not so many tricks on a spade lead.The playEast begins with the queen of spades. North as declarer looks carefully at the hand before winning this trick with the king in dummy. She realises that this was the only way to dummy to be able to take the heart finesse. Remember - eight ever nine never is the rule. In other words, with eight cards between you in a suit the percentage play is to take the finesse. But with nine cards between you, the percentage play is usually to play the ace and then the king to try and drop the queen. So, declarer at trick two plays the two of hearts from dummy, playing the jack from her hand to execute the finesse.This wins, as West has the queen. North then plays the ace of hearts followed by the king, removing all the opponentsrsquo trumps. The odds for a   break are good, % in fact. Declarer then plays the king of diamonds from her hand. West holds up his ace of diamonds for two rounds, until declarer has played the king and queen, overtaking the third diamond with his ace. West does this in case declarer has a losing club, which could be discarded on dummyrsquos jack of diamonds.East has played first the three and then the five of diamonds, indicating he has three cards in that suit. We will see next week how he would have played his diamondshe had four cards in this suit, using what is known as a Peter. West then plays his ace of clubs, and it is all over, North winning the rest of tricks with the ace of spades, the remaining trumps, and the king and queen of clubs. So, she makes her contract of four spades with an overtrick,  tricks in all ndash two spades, five hearts, two diamonds and two clubs.Well bid and well played. Without the use of puppet Stayman North would probably play in three no trumps. On the lead of the queen of spades this only makes nine tricks - two spades, five hearts and two diamonds. Declarer takes the heart finesse and plays all her hearts. Then, she plays the king and queen of diamonds, West winning the third diamond with his ace, having refused to take the king or queen. West would thenthe ten of spades, which would be won by declarerrsquos ace. But when she plays the king of clubs, West pounces with his ace and plays the nine of spades, which wins, followed by Westrsquos last spade won by Eastrsquos queen, East West making four tricks ndash two spades and two aces, East having to discard one of his spades on the preceding tricks.What have we learnt . As we saw last week, five card Puppet Stayman, after the opening bidder has shown a strong two no trumps, is vitalyou are to find either a   of   fit in one of the majors. lsquoPuppetrsquo has sunk into bridge jargon over the past forty-five years. The convention was originally invented by Neil Silverman and developed in the s by Kit Woolsey and Steve Robinson, all American players. As well as finding a   fit in a major, -card puppet Stayman has the advantage that,there is a   fit, the person with the strong hand plays the contract, and the lead comes up to him.. Always take care to take the first trick in the right handyou want to take a finesse.. Sometimes it is advisable to hold up an ace, particularly in no trumps, to block your opponents from entering the hand with winners in it.Penarth club newsPeter Sampsonrsquos ladder competition continues.

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.MORE NEWS:Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers ndash despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniogrsquos  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church ndash which had a well named after Dwynwen ndash can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs.She is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.MORE NEWS:Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers ndash despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniogrsquos  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church ndash which had a well named after Dwynwen ndash can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs.She is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

He leaves a huge gap but his enormous contribution, enthusiasm and positivity will not be forgotten.Des was born in Drogheda in the Republic of Ireland but, whilst still very young, moved to NI where he grew up and was educated. He attended Portadown College before moving to Queen’s University Belfast in  to study German. He graduated with a First Class Honours Degree four years later, which included a year in Freiburg im Breisgau, a city where he made many le-long friends.Des’ first teaching job was back at his alma mater, Portadown College, where he taught German and French between  and . Keen to satisfy his thirst for travel, widen his knowledge of other cultures and experience teaching in other countries, he moved to Uganda in  where he taught French and German at the Aga Khan Secondary School, Kampala for two years. \"Des Johnston in his younger years.Des then ed to County Armagh where he was appointed Head of Modern Languages, again at Portadown College. It was during this time that I had the good fortune and privilege to be one of Des’ pupils. Des was ahead of his time. He recognised the importance of integrating language and culture.In spite of the passage of  years, I remember very clearly the lesson where he set up the screen and projector, cutting edge technology in the s, and showed us slides of his tour on a scooter through France, Luxembourg and Germany. As a class of  year olds, we were transfixed. Des was an example of Dali’s “true artist”, as two years later Keith, George and I packed our rucksacks and followed Des’ tracks, not on a scooter but by train. Des’ inspiration did not stop there as I was to follow his path to a degree in languages at Queen’s, a PGCE and a career in teaching. I was certainly not the first or the last of Des’ pupils to do this. It is striking that Des’ son, Philip, also followed in his dad’s footsteps, working in Germany for three years, studying in the Czech Republic and qualying as a German interpreter – without doubt a chip off the old block. Des knew how to manage a class. He had presence he got lessons off to a fun start he always progressed from what we knew, gave us confidence and self-belief and made us curious to learn more. Lessons were fun. Time flew by. We felt that we were achieving. Motivation was not an issue. He got the very best from each of us. Des was a master of the art of teaching.In  Des’ itchy feet took him to Luxembourg where he spent two years working as a translator for the European Commission. During this time he also won two caps for the national rugby team of Grand Duchy.Keen to pass on his pedagogical skills and knowledge and to champion modern languages teaching and learning, he joined Her Majesty’s Inspectorate, Department of Education, Northern Ireland in . We all feel apprehensive about the visit of the inspector. Des was not to be feared, however. His focus was always on the supportive and the formative. His aim was always to help and guide and build the confidence of those he visited. Des’ distinguished career did not end when he retired in  but rather took a gentle turn. He continued to teach with the University of the Third Age and at Millburn Primary School where he taught English and English as a Foreign Language to Polish children, a role in which he found particular enjoyment and fulfilment.Des was born to teach and so very many of us, across the world, have benefited from his skill, encouragement and warmth. Teaching was not his only passion, however. I have already mentioned his rugby caps for Luxembourg. He also excelled at the shot put in athletics and played badminton and table-tennis. He loved music, good food and reading. Des could talk convincingly and engagingly on a very wide range of subjects. He was knowledgeable, interested and interesting. He was a wonderfully entertaining raconteur, the perfect dinner guest.I feel very honoured to have been able to stay in contact with Des from the time I left Portadown College until a month before he sadly died. He and I always thought it an amazing but lovely coincidence that, in the small world that is language teaching, the boy who was to become his future son-in-law, Chris, was one of my pupils in the school in the north-east of England where I first taught.I was not the only former pupil to enjoy his wisdom, guidance, mentoring, support and friendship for many years after leaving school. I was one of a large number across continents. Des was always generous in investing time in people. He cared. This is why he was so respected and much loved by so many.Des is survived by his we, Irene, and his children Tanya and Philip.Des Johnston -PSNI investigation after girl found dead in NI flats Read the full story hereEditor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Picture: Freddie Parkinson Press EyeIt states: “The [Markethill] district further call on our fellow brother Orangeman, Edwin Poots, the Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to immediately stop officials within his department from implementing the Irish Sea border checks.”In its response, Portadown District said: “The NI Protocol is an act of betrayal of the unionist community and our position as a sovereign part of the United Kingdom.“Portadown District is well aware of those elected politicians who voted for the Irish Sea Border, now is the time for you to apologise for your past actions and to pledge to do all that you can to bring it down, eventhat means disobeying your political leaders.”The statement goes on to call for “all unionist parties to take all necessary action to veto the implementation of EU laws through the Stormont Assembly”.\"DUP MLA William IrwinThe Markethill District comprises  lodges with a combined membership of more than .William Irwin posted his own response to the Markethill statement, describing the claim he supported the Irish Sea border as “untrue”. He said: “As an Orangeman of some  years, in the district of Loughgall... I am very disappointed by Markethill District Orange No ’s untrue claim. “I am absolutely at one with the many thousands of unionists across Northern Ireland who find the imposition of this protocol and its outworkings offensive and running contrary to everything we stand for,” he said.“I did not vote for the protocol nor have I supported it. To suggest otherwise is wrong, disingenuous and it would appear politically motivated.”Although the overwhelming majority of comments were supportive of the Markethill position, one reply said: “I was stunned to read the alleged Markethill District statement, andit is authenticated, they have seriously breached protocol for one and the duty of an Orangeman. I sincerely hope a retraction is publicly published andnot Grand Lodge need to step in.”In response to the latest Portadown District statement, one member said: “As much as I welcome this as an Orangeman, and it’s great to see, the only problem is it won’t make a dference until Grand Lodge publicly make the same statement to which I cant see them doing. I hope I’m proved wrong.”The Grand Lodge of Ireland has not yet responded to a request for comment.READ: Orange Order heartland rocked by bitter row over Irish Sea borderREAD: Lodge breaks ranks with Orange Order over New Decade New Approach dealA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The latest figures show a total of , first doses and , second doses – bringing the overall number of vaccines administered to , Today’s figures provide a further indication of important progress in the roll-out of vaccines to combat the virus. In addition: * Mobile vaccination teams have administered first doses in all of Northern Ireland’s care homes - and second doses to over % of the homes. * We have vaccinated % of the  year olds and over, and have started to vaccinate  –  year olds through the GP programme. * Online booking was opened on Wednesday night for - year-olds to book their vaccination appointments in one of NI’s seven regional vaccination centres. In the first  hours of the online portal, , people had booked their vaccination jabs. Intensive work has been undertaken to address teething problems with the online system, linked to high levels of demand. * A further signicant consignment of the Astra Zeneca vaccine is due in NI next week, for immediate distribution to GPs. This will help facilitate a rapid acceleration of vaccinations for those over  and patients who are Clinical Extremely Vulnerableto Covid-. * In another important development on the vaccine front, a large-scale UK trial for a new coronavirus vaccine indicates it to be .% effective against the virus. The Novavax vaccine is expected to be available across the UK in the second half of this year,approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency  People in Northern Ireland have played a key role in the development of Novavax. Nearly  participants were recruited from Northern Ireland for the trial which was led locally by researchers from Queen’s University Belfast and the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “I want to thank everyone working on the vaccination programme right across Northern Ireland. “This is a massive logistical exercise and I am very encouraged by the strong start we have made. It should be remembered that the first Covid- vaccine approval was only announced last month, with the second approval coming some four weeks later. We have made great strides forward since then. “There will inevitably be frustrations along the way. We will get to everyone - we are getting to thousands more each day.” Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride thanked everyone involved in the Novavax trial. He said: “The rapid development of Covid- vaccines is our long-term route map out of this pandemic. We should be rightly proud that Northern Ireland continues to play its part in the historic global effort to develop new drug treatments and vaccines. Throughout our response we have all come together in support of each other. We continue to see the benefits of the partnership between academia, health and industry and this another example.” The Department of Health this week announced a twin track approach to accelerating NI’s vaccination programme - ensuring more people can take up the offer of vaccination and help protect themselves against Covid-. GPs will be focusing on the  plus age group with the Astra Zeneca vaccine, while the seven regional vaccination centres will in parallel be offeringPfizer vaccination appointments to - year-olds. The plans are to offer everyone over  in NI a vaccine by the end of February. People who are Clinical Extremely Vulnerableto Covid- are also a priority for February. GPs will be vaccinating a large proportion of CEV patients. The twin track approach will see the Trust vaccination centres offering vaccines to CEV patients who are frequent hospital attenders.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbdbbcabddadecd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edfecefbadc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1612024107217.jpg--covid_19___sat_30th_jan_figures.jpg?161202410700","title":"covid  sat th jan figures ","story":" The NI Department of Health dashboard shows a further  coronavirus related deaths and  new positive cases.  deaths occurred outside of the current reporting period.
