They need to be much tougher.\u0027 The Department of Health and Social Care refused to say if staff have returned to the office. A spokesman from the FDA union representing civil servants did not know if mandarins had been instructed to come back in.And Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department could not get all their staff in because there is not enough space in their offices. Asked if he would have 100 per cent of civil servants back in the Department of Health this morning, he told Times Radio: \u0027No, because I didn\u0027t even have 100 per cent before that guidance, because one challenge I have in my department is that we\u0027ve had to increase the size of the department in the pandemic and we don\u0027t have space for everyone.\u0027We don\u0027t have a situation where we have 100 per cent at any time, but in general people that were working from home during Plan B, they are starting to slowly come back, and we want to do that like any employer in a safe way possible, so plans are being put in place now so they can start coming back into work, work from their desks, if that\u0027s what they were doing before.\u0027Earlier today, FDA general secretary Dave Penman tweeted: \u0027It\u0027s insulting because the PM said \u0027back to work\u0027 when everyone\u0027s continued to work hard whether from home or the office. And it\u0027s a strange world when Tory ministers feel able to lecture private enterprise on how to run their businesses.\u0027 A survey by the FDA one year ago found 97 per cent of civil servants want to retain the option of working from home after the pandemic ends, and one senior minister said last October that some were not returning because they \u0027just want to save their lunch and train fares\u0027. In addition, last September it emerged Treasury civil servants would be allowed to work from home indefinitely. Each government department can make its own decisions on how to manage hybrid working.    Mr Johnson said WFH guidance would be dropped immediately and rules on masks in schools would also be scrapped from today. Other restrictions including compulsory face coverings on public transport or in shops and Covid passes for entry to nightclubs and large events will end next Thursday. And the legal requirement for people with Covid to isolate will also be allowed to lapse when the regulations expire on March 24 - possibly even earlier. Bloomberg - Are you a robot?"},{"url":null,"title":"Electric car battery plant power Britains eco drive gets 100m cash injection","story":"Share this article It is due to open by early 2024, having gained planning permission last year.

However, we do appreciate that each school needs to be able to make their own decision based on their school context and it needs to be reviewed regularly.’Children at Hanley Castle High School, Worcestershire, have also been told to keep wearing face coverings.Lindsey Cooke, the head teacher, said: ‘I do think this was a very rushed announcement.‘Our year 11 and year 13 exam groups have missed so much school already what we do not want to do is to rush into taking masks off and then get another outbreak in those year groups.’ But other teachers welcomed the end of masks in schools. Joseph Sparks, an assistant principal at Stationers’ Crown Woods Academy in Greenwich, London, today called face coverings a ‘barrier to learning’.He told Sky News: ‘We welcome the change here at the academy and ultimately we will follow the advice and guidance given to us by the DfE. And as you can see from the students in this particular class, they’ve opted not to wear one this morning. ‘But we’ll leave that choice to them, and for us at the academy, it’s about making them safe and making sure their learning experience is a seamless one and can continue as normal as possible.’Pressed on why masks can be a ‘barrier to learning’, he explained: ‘I had an example yesterday where I was teaching a class, and I didn’t know who had answered the question.‘Sometimes it can be a bit of a barrier like that to that social interaction that takes place, and knowing which students might need help. Ultimately we’ve left that choice to the students from this point.’Mr Sparks added: ‘Our job is to keep the students as safe as possible. We’ve taken lots of measures over the course of the various lockdowns to ensure that our students remain safe.‘We’ve been really fortunate… our students have continued to come to the academy every day, we’ve had really had attendance.’ Britain’s top medics have also insisted that scrapping Covid curbs at such pace ‘risks creating a false sense of security’ with the NHS still under pressure. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association council, said: ‘This decision clearly is not guided by the data. When Plan B was introduced in December, there were 7,373 patients in hospital in the UK. The latest data this week shows there are 18,9791.’He warned that ending mandates on mask-wearing would ‘inevitably increase transmission’ and place the most vulnerable at a higher risk.And Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation representing health bodies, said now ‘is not the time for complacency about this virus’.Deputy chief executive of NHS Providers Saffron Cordery said that some trusts had reported they were expecting their peak later this week despite a fall in case numbers nationally due to regional variations in the number of hospital admissions.‘That\u0027s why it\u0027s important that there is recognition that this surge isn\u0027t over, and that the health service is still operating under extremely challenging circumstances,’ she added.     It comes after Covid cases fell in most parts of the UK for the first time since early December, according to the Office for National Statistics.   Has your child been sent home for refusing to wear a mask?

PA Media quote him saying: That figure would be reached under an optimistic scenario in which booster shots provide very good protection, Karl Lauterbach said in a discussion with state government leaders, sources involved in the talks told Reuters late on Thursday. The number could climb to more than 600,000 daily new cases if the booster shots were less protective, he said, according to the sources. Lauterbach also said he expected the numbers in intensive care in hospitals to increase significantly over coming weeks. Federal and state leaders will discuss on Monday measures to curb the increase.Pressed on whether it was wrong for schools to do so, he said: However, he then went on to say “I’m not here as the business secretary responsible for the economy, which I thought we’d be talking about, to tell school teachers and head teachers how they’re going to run schools.”“The research so far has shown that it has been rules that have been the dominant feature in driving behaviour,” said Prof Robert West, a behavioural scientist at University College London (UCL). “When you take the rules away, it won’t happen immediately, but what we’ve seen previously is a gradual erosion of protective behaviours even when attitudes are not changing that much.” West points to a steady decline in the number of people adhering to advice to wear masks once it is not longer a requirement. “People still said they thought it was a good idea, but fewer and fewer people were actually doing it.” West said that indications that the government would allow the legal requirement to self-isolate to lapse did not necessarily mean that people would jump the gun and change their behaviour in advance of this rule change. “From data earlier in the pandemic we did not see substantial rule-breaking ahead of relaxations but in any event the adherence to self-isolation requirements has been low – one of the reasons why we have done so badly in the UK,” he said.

The team also cleared the way for the removal of crowd limits as well as an end to restrictions on permitted household guests. A phased return to work has also been recommended in order to give workplaces time to organise their own inidual public health measures, a source said.Some of the only restrictions to remain will be around the requirement to wear a mask in retail and on public transport, as well as existing public health measures in places likes schools. A source said that the recommendations went further than many in Government expected and represented a significant acceleration in terms of the path out of the pandemic. The Nphet members were understood to have discussed how the Covid-19 digital pass need no longer be required for access to hospitality given the high levels of either infection or vaccination in the population at present.Live venues and hospitality venues may return to normal capacity while restrictions around nightclubs are also expected to be lifted. A Government source said the main outstanding item will be a decision on what dates the various restrictions will be lifted by. Cabinet will meet on Friday to discuss the recommendations and decide how to proceed. It is expected that restrictions on the 8pm curfew for example, could be lifted from as early as this weekend although sources said the Government is keen to give the hospitality sector time to prepare.Reacting to news of the recommendations, Licensed Vintners Association chief executive Donall O’Keeffe, said: “The news coming from Nphet this evening has been eagerly awaited by the entire hospitality and late night sectors for a long, long time.“Hopefully the Government will now move swiftly and there will be no delays to the full reopening and the scrapping of hospitality restrictions. “Hospitality is ready and waiting to open our doors this weekend.

The Dunsany estate, built more than 900 years ago, is rich in history and is now home to Ireland’s largest re-wilding experiment.A decade ago, film-maker and producer Randal Plunkett, 21st Baron of Dunsany, inherited the castle which lies between the towns of Trim and Dunshaughlin.Plunkett started out by following in his ancestors’ footsteps and continuing to farm the 1,700-acre estate. However, after a few years, he decided to go in a different direction. He removed the grazing animals, started farming crops and gave 750 acres of his land straight back to nature, creating a wildlife reserve on his own doorstep. Seven years on, Plunkett continues to run Ireland’s largest re-wilding experiment.“I think we have to evolve the ways we do things here,” he told presenter Sorcha Pollak who visited the estate with producer Suzanne Brennan. “Re-wilding, reforesting, creating green spaces . . . they’re micro-changes and I think those will have much more impact than whether we have to pay a little extra at the gas pump.“Places like Dunsany shouldn’t be the only one. Dunsany is an oasis, but what I’d really like to see is Dunsany’s part of the web the web of forestry, the web of countryside. Every county should have places like this for the public . . .

It is also expected that schools will remain subject to mask regulations for now. Vaccination passWhile the requirement for the Covid-19 vaccination pass to access hospitality venues will be removed, it will remain for international travel.Capacity restrictions for indoor and outdoor events are also set to be removed, meaning the Six Nations rugby games in February and March can go ahead with full capacity crowds.Some Government sources expressed surprise that the recommendations went further than many expected, with one saying they represented a significant acceleration on the path out of the pandemic.Rules relating to contact tracing and isolation will remain in place, a source said.Both the Cabinet Covid-19 committee and a full Cabinet meeting will take place today and a decision will be made about the dates on which various restrictions will be lifted.

removed the advert from their website, saying that the Christian couple’s “stance is completely opposed to our views and values”.When Mr Whitehouse and Mr Mantell, who have been together for eight years and originally hail from Adelaide, Australia, enquired about the property, they received a message from the owners saying: “Would you mind telling us a bit about your position and circumstances when you have a moment please?”Mr Mantell replied: “‘I’m a 37-year-old TV producer for ITV and Luke is a 33-year-old business owner in education.”However, he said he received a response that left him in tears. It read: “We’re sorry if we seem intrusive, but we just want to make clear that we would be unwilling for two men in a partnership to view or buy our house.“As it is contrary to the gracious teaching in God’s Word, the Holy Bible, e.g Romans 1:24-28 and Jude 7 (King James Version). With regards.”Mr Mantell told MailOnline: “Initially for the first 10 seconds I laughed. I thought it was a joke.“But then I was upset and angry and I had a cry on the phone to my mum. Homophobia still exists, it is still out there. I did not see it coming. I was blindsided by it.”He reported their texts to Purplebricks, which was selling it via Rightmove, which has now decided to cease selling the property.A Purplebricks spokesperson said: “Purplebricks celebrates ersity and the message that Lachlan and Luke received is completely opposed to our views and values. We immediately contacted the seller to return their fee and request that they sell their property with a different agent.”This is not the first time that Ms Brunker and Mr Main have expressed their views on gay relationships - both of them wrote to a House of Lords Committee in 2019 outlining their views on how the subject should be handled in schools’ “relationship education”.Mr Main is listed as a director of LM Buildscapes, a company which was dissolved in 2011. Dr Bunker, who obtained her PhD at University College London, appeared on a 2017 YouTube video as a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Physics and the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute at the University of Cambridge.She is currently listed as staff on the website of Cambridge University’s Synthetic Biology Interdisciplinary Research Centre.Contacted by MailOnline, Mr Main said he would have to discuss the matter with his wife, but added: “Not that we’re ashamed of what we said in any way.”Dr Brunker did not respond to a request for comment via the University of Cambridge made by this newspaper. The  also attempted to contact Mr Main.The incident has echoes of the 2014 “gay cake row” in Belfast when a bakery refused to supply a cake decorated with the words “support gay marriage”.Ashers Bakers won their case in the Supreme Court in 2018 on the grounds that no one could be forced to promote a belief they profoundly disagreed with.Earlier this month, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) threw out the case made against the Christian couple who refused to bake a cake with a message in support of gay marriage in what Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, said was a “victory for freedom of expression and belief”.More from NewsLiz Truss warns Putin to \u0026#39step back\u0026#39 from Ukraine invasionFriday morning UK news briefing: Schools defy PM on masksTonga volcano: experts warn of long term health impactsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"high flying teenager zara rutherford took world won","story":"Faced with an ever-changing myriad of travel restrictions, any teenager would be forgiven for putting plans for a round-the-world trip on hold.One youngster, however, took the idea one step further – she decided to fly herself.Undeterred by the global pandemic, Belgian-British teenager Zara Rutherford set off in her one-seater Shark Ultralight plane in August last year, with her sights set on becoming the youngest woman to fly around the world solo.After 260 hours of flying, the 19-year-old touched down at a small airfield in Flanders on Thursday, flanked by the Belgian equivalent of the Red Arrows, to achieve her goal.Greeted by her family and well-wishers as she arrived at Kortrijk-Wevelgem airport, Zara wrapped herself in British and Belgian flags and told reporters: It\u0027s just really crazy, I haven\u0027t quite processed it.The record had been previously held by American Shaesta Waiz, who was 30 at the time of her attempt in 2017.Although there were many hair-raising moments during the 50,000km odyssey, it was the sub-zero temperatures of the Russian winter that proved the scariest leg of her journey.While flying across the frozen wastes of Siberia, Zara often feared her engines would suddenly stop, leaving her stranded in -35C “hours away from mountain rescue”.“Obviously I don’t know if I can survive very long in that kind of temperature,” she told The .I\u0027d be going hundreds and hundreds of kilometres without seeing anything human - I mean no electricity cables, no roads, no people - and I thought \u0027if the engine stopped now I\u0027d have a really big problem’,” she added.When she landed in the port town of Magadan in northeastern Siberia, a local mechanic blocked up some of the air intakes on her aircraft to keep the engine warm in the extreme cold.Despite the tweaks to the 325kg single-propeller plane, Ms Rutherford was grounded in the town for several days, before spending another three weeks in the village of Ayan near the Sea of Okhotsk as she waited for bad weather to pass.Zara was forced to rely on the goodwill of locals for supplies, whom she said were very willing to help with anything I might need.Other dangers faced by the young pilot during her journey included an earthquake in Veracruz, Mexico, which shook the sixth-floor hotel room she was staying in, as well as tackling thunderstorms in Singapore and navigating her way through wildfire smoke in California and smog over Delhi.The route had taken her through the UK, Iceland, Greenland, Canada, the US and Latin America to Colombia, then back north via Alaska to Russia, China, Indonesia, India and the Middle East before ending in Belgium.As well as being the youngest woman to complete the challenge, Zara has become the first woman to circumnavigate the world in a microlight, and the first Belgian to circumnavigate the world solo by air.When asked what she is most looking forward to now, Zara, who became “obsessed” with flying from the age of eight, said: “Seeing my cats, Chai, Bash and Kaia.She added: “Growing up I didn\u0027t see many other female pilots so right now I am trying to be a friendly face for other girls who want to fly or study Stem subjects and know they are not the only ones.Not content with her landmark achievement, Ms Rutherford has also set her sights on becoming an astronaut and is planning to study computer science at university next September.She said: I don\u0027t think I will be doing this again exactly but I am looking forward to speaking to people about my experiences, to encourage people to do something crazy with their lives.It takes a lot of time, a lot of patience, a lot of work but it is incredible and it is very rewarding.Jane Gandee, headteacher at Zara’s old school in St Swithun\u0027s School in Winchester said fifty of their students were now taking up flying in honour of Zara.More from NewsLiz Truss warns Putin to \u0026#39step back\u0026#39 from Ukraine invasionFriday morning UK news briefing: Schools defy PM on masksTonga volcano: experts warn of long term health impacts\u0026#39Boris has been the most liberty-oriented leader in the West\u0026#39: Readers on the week\u0026#39s top storiesBiden\u0026#39s media cheerleaders failed the worldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel tests have almost no impact spread covid variants","story":"Travel tests have virtually no effect in preventing the spread of Covid variants from abroad unless restrictions are introduced within a day of the strain first being imported to the UK, according to a scientific analysis.The research found any travel restrictions could only delay the peak of a new variant by between two and eight days – but this would only be effective if they were imposed as the variant was first brought in.Each additional day of delay after that reduced the impact to the point that, by day six, it only held back the peak by a day, according to the modelling by  Edge Health and Oxera, a specialist research consultancy that works with the NHS.It took 16 days for the UK to detect and react to the omicron variant after it had already arrived, suggesting any tests would only be introduced long after they could have any effect in delaying the peak of the virus.The research, funded by Airlines UK and Manchester Airports Group (MAG), has been presented to the Government to support plans by ministers to ditch day two lateral flow tests.Charlie Cornish, the MAG chief executive, said: The findings show conclusively that testing for international travel will not deliver significant benefits in managing the spread of new variants.As we learn to live with Covid-19, it is important that people are allowed to travel free of the additional cost and uncertainty which testing creates. This study provides ministers with the clear evidence that this is achievable.The UK Government has taken the step to remove domestic restrictions, and it should now apply this approach to international travel. We must allow the country\u0027s worst hit sector to resume its road to recovery, and for the UK economy to benefit from the billions of pounds of economic value aviation generates.The Government has already ditched pre-departure and day two PCR tests for vaccinated travellers, leaving families facing just day two lateral flow tests – which add £120 to the cost of a holiday for a family of four.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, backs dropping the tests and it is thought that Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, is also on board. A decision is expected when travel restrictions are reviewed by ministers next week.More from NewsLiz Truss warns Putin to \u0026#39step back\u0026#39 from Ukraine invasionFriday morning UK news briefing: Schools defy PM on masksTonga volcano: experts warn of long term health impacts\u0026#39Boris has been the most liberty-oriented leader in the West\u0026#39: Readers on the week\u0026#39s top storiesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"friday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"With the easing of Covid restrictions, the Prime Minister announced that masks are no longer necessary in classrooms. But head teachers are defying the Government by insisting children continue to wear face coverings despite official guidance being changed. More than 100 schools have written to parents to say pupils must carry on wearing them in lessons.

One called the decision a slap in the face.Adele said: I\u0027m so sorry but my show ain\u0027t ready. We\u0027ve tried absolutely everything that we can to pull it together in time and for it to be good enough for you but we\u0027ve been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and Covid.Half my team are down with Covid, they still are, and it\u0027s impossible to finish the show. I can\u0027t give you what I have right now and I\u0027m gutted and I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s so last minute.The Easy On Me singer said team members had been awake for over 30 hours trying to figure out how to put on the show but they had now run out of time.I\u0027m so upset and I\u0027m really embarrassed and I\u0027m so sorry to everyone who has travelled again. I\u0027m really sorry. Saying she was sorry eight times in a 92-second message, especially for people who had traveled to Las Vegas for the show, Adele said the delays prevented her from perfecting the show to her standards and she promised to reschedule.We\u0027re on it right now we\u0027re going to reschedule all the dates and I\u0027m going to finish my show and I\u0027m going to get it to where it needs to be.It\u0027s been impossible, we\u0027ve been up against so much and it just ain\u0027t ready. I\u0027m really sorry.Tickets for the shows – which were due to take place every weekend until April – ranged from £60 to £500 and were Adele\u0027s first live concerts in five years.Some fans now face losing hundreds of pounds from flights and hotel reservations.Gillian Rowland-Kain, who lives in New York, was on a flight to Las Vegas for Friday night\u0027s show when she found out about the postponement via social media.She said: Her lack of notice is astounding. I\u0027m angry and frustrated.I was furious that Adele waited so last minute to make this call. I recognise it\u0027s not a call any artist wants to make but she would\u0027ve known yesterday that the show wouldn\u0027t be ready by tomorrow.She added that the last-minute cancellation felt like a slap in the face.Josh Chavis, who lives in Missouri, told the BBC that his wife Heather paid nearly £1,300 for her hotel and flights for a show this weekend.Mr Chavis said that his wife was disappointed - and even Adele announcing it a few days sooner would have made all the difference in terms of being able to secure refunds or rearrangements.We recognise that things are hard for everyone Mr Chavis said, but this is a huge misstep on the part of both the performer and those responsible for putting the show together.There was also plenty of supportive responses to Adele\u0027s announcement on social media.@ashlovert wrote: \u0027I had tickets to see u tomorrow and it’s fine, health will always come first and specially in times like this, can’t wait for all the shows to get rescheduled cuz I can’t wait to have the best time of my life with you on stage, pls don’t feel guilty, it breaks my heart, I LOVE YOU.\u0027Others made fun of her emotional delivery. \u0027I like  you Adele, but come on,\u0027 wrote @lAndyHwk. \u0027No No need to bawl your eyes out. It\u0027s postponing a few shows. In the grand scheme of everything going on in the world, it\u0027s really not a big deal.\u0027Adele\u0027s residency was due to begin at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace Hotel on January 21.The shows were to follow her latest album 30, which debuted at No 1 in 30 countries in November.Concert residencies in Las Vegas have become a major attraction in the recent years for musicians who do not wish to travel extensively.Celine Dion, Katy Perry, Carrie Underwood, Usher, Barry Manilow and Shania Twain are among the top acts to have recently scheduled multiple concert dates in Las Vegas.More from NewsLiz Truss warns Putin to \u0026#39step back\u0026#39 from Ukraine invasionFriday morning UK news briefing: Schools defy PM on masksTonga volcano: experts warn of long term health impactsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid here forever says sajid","story":"Covid here forever says Sajid Javid with decision in weeks on scrapping all isolationThe Health Secretary said Covid will be with us perhaps forever and Brits will probably need annual vaccinations - as he promised a decision in the next few weeks on ending isolation from March this.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video sajid-javid-says-need-learn-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:HMCPWjGg,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Health Secretary defended comparing the virus to flu despite over , UK deaths, saying it would become endemic in future thanks to vaccination and better treatment. He said Brits would “probably” need annual vaccinations against Covid like against flu. But he insisted he plans to axe mandatory isolation for infected people from March  - with a final decision on the date “in the next few weeks”.It comes as England’s Plan B work-from-home guidance - along with face masks in school classrooms - have both been axed as of today. From next Thursday England will also axe mandatory Covid passes for nightclubs, mandatory face masks in shops and on public transport, and face masks in communal areas of schools.The government has also vowed to scrap free lateral flow tests in future, with a leaked document suggesting this will happen from the end of June. But Mr Javid also said he would choose to wear a mask in a supermarket or on the London Underground, with guidance continuing to recommend them in enclosed spaces. And one exception is Mr Javid still plans to press ahead with plans to force frontline NHS staff to be vaccinated as a “condition of deployment” from April .Asked by Sky Newshe meant to compare Covid to flu, Mr Javid replied: “Yes”. He said: “If at the start of covid when we had no vaccines, we had no testing infrastructure, we had no treatments, people were comparing it to flu - that would’ve been wrong.” But he added: “We need to learn to live with it. Sadly people die of flu as well. In a bad flu year, you can sadly lose about , lives. “But we don’t shut down our entire country and put in place lots of restrictions to deal with it. We need to continue with our lives with sensible, appropriate and proportionate measures.  “The one thing we’ve learned about flu, because it’s been around for far longer, is we have annual vaccinations, for older people in particular, for children as well. We have good advice. “We may well have some kind of annual vaccination. I think that’s where we’ll probably end up, but it’s really dficult for anyone to say exactly in the longer term where we’ll be. He added: “Covid is not going away. It’s going to be with us for many many years, perhaps forever, and we have to learn to live with it.”Yesterday Boris Johnson confirmed to MPs that the remaining Plan B rules in England would be allowed to expire on January  as the peak of the Omicron wave appeared to be over.The under-fire Prime Minister suggested the country was shting towards living with Covid - like flu - as he battled to save his premiership.  The PM told MPs: There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we donapost place legal obligations on people to isolatethey have flu. As Covid becomes endemic, we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance, urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others.Mr Johnson also told MPs the Government now intended to set out its long-term strategy for living with Covid- , adding: Explaining how we hope and intend to protect our liberty and avoid restrictions in future by relying instead on medical advances, especially the vaccines which have already saved so many lives.But to make that possible we must all remain cautious during these last weeks of winter. There are still over , people in hospital in England alone. The pandemic is not over.

Work from home guidance has been axed in England and children were allowed to take off their masks in classrooms today as experts said the Omicron wave had peaked.Next Thursday, Covid passes are no longer needed and face coverings will no longer be mandatory in indoor public spaces in England, including on public transport.  Self-isolation laws for infected people are due to expire in March - and could be axed sooner. But there were growing fears lting measures could trigger a resurgence in the highly-transmissible iant. Latest data today showed another , infections and  deaths. Union leaders believe easing curbs could backfire - and TV doctor Hilary Jones agreed.This is a worry to many, many people. Itaposs not just me who thinks itaposs too much too soon,” he told ITV ’s Good Morning Britain. “Teachers, NHS providers, the Royal College of Nursing, Unison - theyaposre all very concerned that taking away all restrictions suddenly, despite the data, is too much too soon.So what rules are being scrapped, when - and what will stay  Here’s a full run-down.Rules that are set to be scrapped January : Working from home guidance endsSince December  people were urged to “work from homeyou can” in England. But that was axed immediately in an announcement by Boris Johnson on Wednesday  January. The guidance, which was not legally binding, was a key way of getting cases down. But officials admitted it had “immediate costs to the economy”. “People should speak to their employers about arrangements for ing to the office,” the Department of Health said. There is still “working safely guidance” about how to keep Covid cases down, including ventilation and regular cleaning. January : Masks in classrooms axedEnglandaposs secondary schools had told students and staff to wear face masks in the classroom since January . Those rules have been axed as of today, with masks in communal areas continuing to be recommended for another week.Week of January : Covid travel tests could be axed for the vaccinatedVaccinated travellers will soon be allowed toto the UK without taking a Covid test at all,a change gets the go-ahead. Currently vaccinated travellers must take a lateral flow test within two days of ing to Britain. Anyone who tests positive must isolate for ten days, although this can be cut short with a negative lateral flow test on days six and seven.But Transport SecretaryGrant Shappsis looking at removing this last UK test requirement for vaccinated travellers by the end of January.Any announcement is likely in the week of January , the Mirror understands. Unjabbed travellers would still need to take UK arrival tests - and of course, British tourists may still have to take tests when heading abroad. January : Compulsory masks scrapped in all settingsFace masks were made compulsory in England in two waves through winter, first on public transport, then in shops. They are also mandatory in shopping malls, taxis, banks, post offices, hair salons, barbers, nail salons, pharmacies, vets, auction houses, takeaways , estate agents. All those laws will be axed at .am on Thursday  January. At the same time, so will guidance on wearing masks in school corridors and halls. But wearing a mask will still be recommended in some settings, evenit’s not legally binding.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: I think it will be sensible on the tube in London, for example - quite an enclosed space. People will be asked to make their own personal judgment just as we do in fighting flu.January : Covid passes axed for nightclubsSince December , nightclubs and large events like gigs and football matches in England had to ask punters for proof of either a vaccine, or negative lateral flow test. But the law that enforces Covid ‘passports’ expires at .pm on Wednesday  January and will not be renewed. Covid passes can still be used by nightclubs voluntarily but this appears unlikely to be widespread.Boris Johnsonwould likely have needed to put any extension to a vote - and last time around  Tory MPs rebelled.The Prime Minister is already battling for survival over Downing Street parties, and another huge revolt could have been be fatal.Date not known: Definition of fully-jabbed will include a boosterThe government has repeatedly said it will update the definition of fully-jabbed to include a booster in England. While this will no longer matter for domestic Covid passes , it will matter for whether you isolate when entering the UK. Scotland already made this change for its Covid passes on January , for anyone whose second dose was at least four months ago. England has been holding out on announcing a date, because so many people had Covid over Christmas. The infections meant they were unable to get a vaccine for  days afterwards. Date not known: Daily testing for Covid contacts could be cutThe self-isolation period for people with Covid was shortened this week to at least five full days in England.Butyou’re a contact of someone with Covid, you still need to take a daily lateral flow test forsevendays .The government has said it will review this guidance - hinting it could be cut to five days too - but has not given a date for a change.March  : Isolation for positive Covid cases scrappedBoris Johnson has announced he “very much expects” to scrap legally-binding isolation for all Covid-positive people from March . This will be a massive change, and end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive for the virus. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said the dates are not final but an announcement could be made “in the next few weeks”. Boris Johnson told MPs: “As Covid becomes endemic we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others. The self-isolation regulations expire on th March, at which point I very much expect not to renew them. Indeed were the data to allow, I would like to seek a vote in this House to bring that date forwards.Spring : Shutting down PCR testing centresLocal Covid testing centres will start to be shut down from the spring, according to The Times. Since the multi-billion pound Test and Trace programme was set up, a huge network of testing centres has ballooned in places like car parks. The average person in England travels just . miles to get a test. Ministers reportedly accept this cannot be sustained long-term, with a source telling The Times: “The wind-down will be quite swt and will mean fewer test centres because we donapost need all of the sites.”End of June : Free lateral flow tests scrappedThe government made clear in autumn  that at some point, free mass lateral flow tests would end and people would start having to pay. Now a leaked document has suggested officials have pencilled in a date of the end of June, after it was put back from Spring amid an outcry. The government has declined to say what the tests cost, with one source suggesting it is £ for a seven-pack. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: Lateral flow tests remain free to use and we continue to encourage people to access them. “At a later stage the Government, as our response to the virus evolves, universal free provision of things like lateral flow tests will end and we will update once we are in that position. Thereaposs been no decision made on when that will be.”Rules that are set to stay Guidance on masks and testingDespite most laws being axed in England, there is likely to still be guidance on keeping yourself and vulnerable relatives safe. This can include keeping rooms well-ventilated, meeting outdoors where possible and taking a lateral flow test before you go. The government added: “Public health guidance will remain in place, suggesting iniduals should continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces, where you may come into contact with people you do not normally meet.”Compulsory vaccines for NHS and care staff Covid vaccines will be made mandatory for all frontlineNHSstaff in England from April  as a “condition of deployment”.It is already a condition of deployment in care homes despite fears of mass staff shortages, which have prompted a relaxation of immigration rules. The Department of Health and Social Care accepted there may be a “signicant” hit to the workforce as millions are told ‘no jab, no job’. A government impact statement has now estimated , health and care staff could refuse to be vaccinated under the policy, without having a medical exemption. But Mr Javid said NHS staff already need vaccines against other illnesses and it will protect patients.Regular booster vaccinesScientists have repeatedly said there will be an annual booster programme for Covid, either for the whole population or just the vulnerable. Sajid Javid said: “The one thing we’ve learned about flu, because it’s been around for far longer, is we have annual vaccinations, for older people in particular, for children as well. “We may well have some kind of annual vaccination. I think that’s where we’ll probably end up, but it’s really dficult for anyone to say exactly in the longer term where we’ll be.”Keeping powers in reserveJust because legal powers are axed, it does not mean they won’t be brought back. The government has the power to lay Covid restrictions at any time under public health laws dating back to .

Last week, they opposed Labour’s plans to stop anti-vax protests threatening teachers and children outside schools. This week, they tried to bring in powers to stop and search anyone in a peaceful protest. Instead of taking sensible action to keep people safe, they are targeting peaceful protestors and bystanders. It’s a mess. Stronger action is clearly needed to protect schools and vaccine clinics from threatening anti-vax groups. Children shouldn’t face intimidation on the way into school and NHS staff shouldn’t face threats or abuse on the way into work, especially when their job is saving lives. There have also been recent reports that one group has been doing combat training. That’s why Labour put forward proposals to offer councils fast-track powers to set up protection zones around schools and vaccine clinics. People have a right to protest but they don’t have a right to intimidate others, especially children. Shockingly, the Conservatives voted against those proposals.  Labour also supported stronger action against dangerous demonstrations on motorways like the irresponsible Insulate Britain protests last year. Someone could have been killed. No one has a right to put lives at risk, so Labour Lords voted this week for stronger sentences for protests on motorways and A-roads. The police and courts also already have many existing powers to deal with serious disruption from protests and we called for better guidance and training for police on how they should be used. But instead of focusing on protests that are threatening, violent or put other people’s safety at risk, the Government is trying to silence peaceful protesters. Under their plans, peaceful protestors objecting to the closure of a local swimming pool or maternity unit could be stopped and searched by police for no reason at all. Anyone passing by a protest, to get to work, or to take a child to school, could also be stopped and searched without suspicion. Protestors could also be stopped for being noisy. We know that this Tory Government doesn’t like being challenged, but potentially criminalising people just for singing or chanting undermines Britain’s important freedoms and rights.  Rightly, the House of Lords voted against these plans this week. From the suffragettes to the Countryside Alliance, people have always had a right to object publicly to things that governments or big corporations do, whether ministers like it or not. Throughout history, it is how some of our important freedoms have been won. The Conservatives are giving us the worst of all worlds - trying to silence peaceful protesters, but not taking action on anti-vaxxers intimidating children. They need to think again. Labour’s contract with the British people has respect and security at its heart. That means respecting Britainaposs long-standing democratic traditions and standing up for public safety and security at the same time.

Several potential defectors are being wooed by the party in the aftermath of Christian Wakeford’s bombshell switch, it is understood.Sources warned against any imminent defection - but one suggested there could be a breakthrough in future. The source said the door is always open, adding: “I’m not expecting an imminent second one - but that doesn’t mean there won’t be one. “We’ll have to see what happens over the next few weeks.”  The PM’s position temporarily stabilised following Mr Wakeford’s dramatic decision, with claims some no-confidence letters had been withdrawn. Backbench MP Andrew Percy said Mr Wakeford’s defection had “kind of made people a bit more relaxed, itaposs calmed nerves”. He added: “I think people have recognised that actually this constant navel gazing and internal debating is only to the advantage of our political opponents. “The Prime Minister is probably thanking Christian for what he did because itaposs made a lot of people think again, think twice.But Mr Wakeford was in talks with Labour for months, pre-dating Partygate after he privately voiced concerns about the direction of the government.And today’s Tory unity may just be a stay of execution as No braces for next week’s make-or-break investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray.Senior Tory William Wragg, who has already called for Mr Johnson to quit, today accused government figures of aposblackmailapos to persuade MPs to stay loyal.  Veteran Tories could seal Mr Johnson’s fate next week after the report is published. Insiders fear it will not fully clear the PM. Itaposs not going to be as good as people think,” a Government source told the Times. “Sheaposs genuinely struggling to reconcile the Prime Ministeraposs claim that this was a work event with what sheaposs been hearing from other people. “Itaposs very dficult for her. One Labour source said: “There are obviously a number of people on the Tory benches who are feeling uncomfortable with their current position, and reflecting on whether they’re in the right.“It’s a massive show of confidence in the Labour Party that someone who’s been in the Conservative Party can see this is a party serious about government.”But they warned against any imminent new defections and said: “Other people have expressed dissatisfaction with where they are but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll cross the floor - it takes a tremendous amount of courage to do that.”  A second source said: “I don’t think there’s any imminently because it’s such a big political thing. “The first one is the hardest - no one doing it for  years creates a kind of aura about it that’s quite hard to break. But it’s a big thing to do regardless... I’m not aware of anyone whose headspace is ‘I’m in the wrong party’.”Health Secretary Sajid Javid desperately tried to shore up the PM, saying he thought Mr Johnson was secure in his post - despite calls from some Tory MPs for him to resign over Downing Street lockdown parties.Askedthe PM was safe in his job, Mr Javid said: Yes, I think he is. At the same time, people are right to be angered and pained about what they have seen and they have heard. I share that anger and pain. “I think it is right that there is a proper investigation going on that will establish the facts and that the Prime Minister will come back to Parliament and properly respond. Mr Javid called for Mr Wakeford to trigger a by-election in his Bury South seat.  Mr Javid admitted David Davisaposs call for the PM to quit was damaging for Mr Johnson.The former Brexit Secretary quoted from the  Norway Debate when he urged Mr Johnson to stand aside, telling him In the name of God, go.Mr Javid conceded: It is damaging, of course it is. The Health Secretary also said thatMr Johnson was found to have broken the law he would have to go. The Ministerial Code is very clear. If any minister from the Prime Minister down breaks the law, of course they shouldnapost continue to serve as a minister, he said. What I have just said is a general rule that applies to everyone. There is no exception to that rule. He admitted the scandal had damaged UK democracy. If there were people at the heart of government who were not following the rules, absolutely they should be disciplined and I look forward to seeing that disciplinary action taking place, he said. We do now know there were some parties. We know that because some of the people that were involved and broke the rules have come forward to say so. Of course things like this damage our democracy.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyLabour PartyDavid DavisBoris JohnsonCivil servantsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Angry Red Wall MPs have been heaping pressure on the Prime Minister as Westminster buzzes with rumours over how many letters of no confidence have gone into the Tory backbench  Committee. Only  chairman Sir Graham Brady knows the true number but tensions are running high as Boris Johnson tries to win over his mutinous MPs. Six senior Tories have openly called for Mr Johnson to quit but reports of a Red Wall rebellion are adding to the PMaposs woes. Dubbed the pork pie plot as a meeting was hosted by the Melton MP Alicia Kearns, it underlines the level of anger among some of the  intake.And Bury South MP Christian Wakeford dramatically abandoned the Tories for the Labour Party on Wednesday. Here we look the new rebels making le dficult for Boris Johnson. What is a aposRed Wallapos Tory MP  The term loosely refers to the Conservatives who won their seats off Labour during Boris Johnsonaposs  election landslide. The Red Wall is a nickname for Labouraposs traditional heartlands in England and Wales, particularly seats in the North of England, North Wales and the Midlands . A swathe of these seats turned Tory in , including Tony Blairaposs old seat of Sedgefield, in Co Durham, Blyth Valley in Northumberland and Workington in Cumbria. These MPs were perceived as loyal to Boris Johnson but discontent has been mounting over broken promises on levelling up and rail reform. Partygate has also landed badly with voters, and some of these new MPs may be feeling vulnerable going into the next election. Who are the Pork Pie plotters  Alicia Kearns The former Foreign Office official has been outspoken about the UK’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the handling of the crisis by senior civil servants. Ms Kearns, , MP for Rutland and Melton has hosted meetings of anti-Johnson plotters - leading to the plan being named after Melton Mowbray’s most famous export. Her , majority in the safe blue East Midlands seat allows her the luxury of plotting.  Dehenna Davison The PM’s then girlfriend and now we Carrie was pictured campaigning with Ms Davison in Bishop Auckland, Co Durham in the run-up to the  ballot. The -year-oldaposs stunning victory was the first time the Tories had won the seat in nearly  years. The arch Brexiteer presents a GB News show with ex-UKIP chief Nigel Farage.  Gary Sambrook The Birmingham Northfield MP is a Covid passport rebel and said the PM must consider his positionhe is found to have broken lockdown laws. As secretary of the  Committee, Mr Sambrook, , would be one of the MPs responsible for running a no-confidence vote and subsequent leadership race. Chris Loder The former train guard, , worked his way up through the industry to become head of new trains for South Western Railway. His majority of , in the Conservative stronghold of West Dorset should make him electorally immune to fury at the PM and Partygate. Christian WakefordThe Bury South MP didnapost attend the meeting but he became the first Red Wall Tory to say publicly that he had submitted a latter of no confidence.Within  hours he had defected to Labour, dramatically joining the party for Prime Ministeraposs Questions on Wednesday.In an excoriating letter to Boris Johnson, he said: Britain needs a Government focused on tackling the cost-of-living crisis and providing a path out of the pandemic that protects living standards and defends the security of all. It needs a Government that upholds the highest standards of integrity and probity in public le and sadly both you and the Conservative Party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and Government this country deserves.He added: My decision is about much more than your leadership and the disgraceful way you have conducted yourself in recent weeks.

Labour leader Keir Starmer said: I would like to welcome Christian Wakeford to the Labour Party. He has always put the people of Bury South first.But Health Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: “I feel sorry for the people of Bury South. I think a by-election would be welcome… I think Christian should be happy with a by-election”. He added: “They’ve got an MP who’s changed his affiliation without their permission”. Labour has indicated there will not be a by-election. So what do the voters of Bury South think  We spoke to them.  In the town of Prestwich, which sits in the Bury South constituency, there was a mixed response today to Christian Wakeford’s defection from Tory to Labour. Sham Raja, , said: “It’s so shameful. He signed up to be a Conservative MP. It’s disgraceful, he was elected under the Conservative banner.“There are lots of small businesses struggling at the moment and he’s said nothing about this. Boris Johnson was the only guy to bring us out of Europe and get Brexit done.“I think he should step down as an MP andhe wants to be a Labour MP, he should apply to be one. “He’s not won on a Labour  and he should take it upon himself to step down.” Jeremy Burtles, , said: “There should be another election – you can’t just switch. If you want to change parties, you need to step down. “You always vote for the party you want in charge so I think it’s ridiculous to switch all of a sudden. “If you’re going to change your view, you should just step down.” And Hazel Donnelly, , said: “I don’t think it was very good at all, he shouldn’t be allowed to do that.  “It won’t change the way I vote because I am a Conservative. “I don’t think it’s a big deal what Boris did - there are much worse things that have happened recently. “There should be certain rules with these things. I think he has broken a rule but there are more important things going on at the moment.” But Barry Humphries, , backed the MPaposs decision. He said: “Good for him, I think he’s doing what’s right for him and he’s standing up for what he believes in.” And Ifkan Ahmed, , added: “I’ve always been happy with him. I think these days it’s okay to change your policies. “He has been very good for our area and I’m happy with what he’s done. It doesn’t matter to me that he has changed.”  Vickie Stone, , said: “If he wants to do it because of Boris Johnson then I think that’s fair enough. “If he doesn’t agree with the way Boris is handling the situation then that’s up to him. “I’m more bothered about the leadership, I’m worried about who is going to replace Borisit ends up going that way.” In Radclfe, the centre of the constituency, the MPaposs office, painted in true-blue Tory colours, was shuttered. Outside on the street, ex-Labour and current Tory voter Mavis Leach said: Well, Iaposm surprised. Are there others doing it, as well, getting out of a sinking ship before it goes down  Mrs Leach, who said she disavowed Labour because of a dislike for former leader Jeremy Corbyn, said Boris Johnson should stay on as Prime Minister.I know heaposs done wrong, done a lot of things wrong, she said. Boris has done a lot of things. We know that. But I think heaposs done a good job in other things,bringing the vaccinations in, and weaposre in a good place for that. Another local, Jonathan Boston, a Labour supporter, said Mr Wakefordaposs change in loyalty is really good news. Presumably, itaposs all to do with partygate, he said, referring to allegations of lockdown-busting parties within No , though a Labour spokesman has since said talks with Mr Wakeford began before the scandal hit. Mr Boston said: From what one hears, all the MPs have had millions of emails from constituents saying, aposItaposs terrible and heaposs got to go,apos so I donapost think any Tory voter, even in Radclfe, or Bury South or whatever, would be surprised at .probably the first of many, I would have thought, especially the newer MPs. I think a lot of the newer ones will do a similar thing. Meanwhile, Chris Holland said he rated Mr Wakeford as a local MP but had not voted for him. He said: Iaposve never voted Tory and I never would do. Iaposve messaged him a few times and he has got back to me. To me, heaposs not been doing too bad. Iaposd rather have a Labourthan a Tory. David Collins, who runs Marieaposs Coffee Shop, a stoneaposs throw from Mr Wakefordaposs constituency office, said: I probably wouldnapost vote for either of them anyway, Labour or Conservative. Theyaposre all as bad as each other. They all promise theyaposre going to do things and none of it ever materialises, does it  You wouldnapost think you were able to jump ship halfway through, would you   Tory voter Joan Humphreys said she feels like her tick at the ballot box has now been wasted. She said: I feel like going down there and saying, aposRight. I want to withdraw it.apos If he wants to become Labour, and he wants to support Labouraposs policies, we should have a by-election and see what the people say. If Boris had held his hands up at the beginning, people would have been far more forgiving about it, but heaposs not. But who are you going to have instead of Boris  I canapost see anybody .

But Lisa didnapost find out her best friendaposs fate until days after the attack, while she was recovering from the shock at her parentsapos house in Virginia.

Stunned mum Kelly Grfiths said her son Louis ended up with teeth in his nose after the water at the pool was turned off. Grim photos show the treatment the schoolboy had to go through to get his smile back. Kelly told Wales Online there was blood everywhere and Louis had to be rushed to hospital. She said: I was actually back in the room, it was about .pm and Iaposd headed back up so I could shower before tea and thataposs when the kids my son had been at the pool with had come up to the room and said aposLouisapos knocked his front teeth outapos.

His cousin Mason had carried him to the showers and there was blood everywhere.When I got down there they were already rushing him through into the doctoraposs room at the hotel and  mins later we were on our way to hospital.Louis, from Bridgend, was on a week-long family holiday in Antalya, Turkey, with his mum, nan, and his cousin, when he suffered the serious injuries. Kelly continues the story: We eventually were sent to the emergency dentist where he was seen by an oral surgeon. His teeth had been pushed all the way up into his nasal cavity, so it looked like he had a broken nose. Thanks to her former job, Kelly was well aware of what was at risk.  She said: Having been a dental nurse, I knew exactly how bad this could be, and it only made me worry more. These were his adult teeth so I knew he was at risk of losing them. Louis was operated on there at the dental surgery and had his teeth repositioned and splinted, all whilst he was awake. Kelly said: They gave him five injections of local anaesthetic and they cut his gum open and pulled the teeth back down and had them positioned by the splint. I think he was just in shock, in this country he would have been put to sleep. The holiday was ruined after that, and we were only on day two.

Dr Mohan said: “The pictures of Louis have been inspirational to show other children who have suffered a trauma that you can come through it.It helps their parents as well. The worst can happen, and you can still come out with a beautul smile. Kelly said she couldnapost thank the dental team enough for helping Louis get his smile back.

They’re equipped with latest anti-tank weapons for use against the Red Army. They’re there to train Ukrainian soldiers, says the MoD, not to fight. But this is how wars begin. It’s called mission creep. The Americans were only in Vietnam to train local forces, until they weren’t. And look what happened.  If British soldiers come under direct fire, they must defend themselves. Then what  RAF sorties to take out attacking Russian forces  More, and bigger, military involvement  Tory MPs led by ex-officer Tobias Ellwood have formed a Charge of the Fight Brigade, egging on the military. How long before Boris Johnson begins to parade as the true successor to liberator Thatcher  But Donetsk isn’t British. This isn’t the Falklands. I’m no pacist –we’re invaded, stick a rle in my hands – and I hold no brief for dictator Vladimir Putin. His ambition to rebuild a Russian empire of influence from the ruins of the USSR is clear. But this is not our fight. They are not at the gates of Greenwich, and Nato is a reliable bulwark against any such danger. The Germans, who have much more to lose from a conflict close to their borders, promise “everything short of war”: punitive sanctions to hit the Russian economy hard. We should do the same.

Some even had their jackets confiscated as temperatures plunged during a chilly start to . Now Bishop Heber have hit out at the parents for abusive language while branding their fury upsetting. What do you think about this story  Let us know in the comments below  One mum said her asthmatic son was put into isolation for retrieving his seized coat because he was so cold. Photos taken by irate parents show staff milling around outside in warm overcoats while some children are just in thin jumpers with temperatures as low as C. Last week, the school said it believeskids were allowed to wear their own coats it would erode the great relationships we have with the students after fears they might end up wearing hoodies. After more backlash, they have now urged parents to raise concerns in a more formal manner.  A statement from the school read: Almost  years ago, the school made a commitment to an affordable unorm policy, and we believe the current unorm is one of the cheapest to buy in the region and complies with the affordable school unorm legislation being introduced this year. The coat was chosen and designed by students in  and costs £. The school is confident that students are not sitting in classrooms that are unusually cold for the time of year and students should not need to wear coats to keep warm. Additionally, all students have access to an indoor space and or classroom during any breaks.  We hope that parents and the wider community appreciate that governors and school leaders are trying to do their best in what has been an exceptionally dficult period for us all. Governors hope that parents will use the school complaints policythey have a concern. Such complaints can be dealt with formally and carefully and without some of the upsetting, abusive and inflammatory language that has been directed at staff and governors.

Andrew Watts, , had one of the longest hospital stays doctors had ever seen after spending eight months in intensive care followed by another two months on a ward.The dad-of-two spent  days at Queen Elizabeth Hospital where he was admitted with Covid- pneumonia on Christmas Day in .In February, after a five-week induced coma and two le-threatening lung collapses, doctors called Mr Wattsapos we Hayley to discuss switching off his ventilator because his condition had deteriorated so badly.But the family insisted he should be given more time and he has since left hospital - and now he has come off a nasal cannula for the first time, reports My London.Mr Watts, from Bexley in South London, was finally able to go home in October and said he is doing well but still battles with ongoing complications.  The cab driver, who was in remission from lymph cancer at the time, had to relearn how to walk and talk after spending so long on a ventilator. In intensive care, he used a tracheostomy pipe and had to communicate with his we using letters on a board. Only a week and a half ago, I came off a nasal cannula for the first time since leaving hospital, Mr Watts said. I used it for nine hours every night to aid my recovery to help my lungs get back to some sort of normality. The cabbie told how he has not healed properly after the ventilator and tube was in his neck for so long in hospital. Thataposs why there is a whistle when Iaposm talking as there is essentially a hole in my neck where air comes out, he added.  I canapost get water in it or it makes me cough like mad. I could get an infection which means I canapost go swimming and I canapost shower the way I want to. Mr Wattsapos family, including Hayley and sons Jack, six, and Joshua, three, have all supported his recovery. In November, Mr Watts said his major goal was to walk his sons to school and he can currently walk for up to  minutes walking before his legs start burning. I managed to get to my son’s school and back last Monday. I say that - we parked around the corner, so it wasnapost the full way. But still, he said. I think people should be grateful that they can do these little tasks. Day-to-day, when youaposre fit and healthy, you just do these things and donapost think about.  But when it got taken away from me, it made me realise not to take it for granted. When Mr Watts first went into hospital in December , he had not been vaccinated, due to the very early stage of the vaccination campaign - but he has since had three doses of a Covid vaccine. Looking back on his experience, which included doctors at one time calling his family to tell them they were considering turning his ventilator off, Mr Watts urged others to get vaccinated. When in hospital, he recalled how they did not believe that vaccinations would do anything and that the whole pandemic was a conspiracy. “The fact that there are people that know what Iaposve been through and still say that, he said. Itaposs up to iniduals. If it was me, I would tell them to go and get it. If they decide not to get it, then that’s their own fault. Andrew said he was badly impacted by the virus because he was in remission from lymph cancer after successful chemotherapy treatment. It comes as the Prime Minister today announced the end of Plan B measures - with the onus now falling on the British public to mitigate the risks of Covid. Mr Watts welcomes the change, despite still being clinically vulnerable. He said I want everyone to live their lives to the max, this isnapost going anywhere we’ve got to learn to live with it. “I could wrap myself in cotton wool and live in a box but then whataposs the point in living  I want the world to get back” “Itaposs unlikely I would get it again.

Last July, Harry was reportedly chased by a pack of photographers after he attended a charity event with sick children at Kew Gardens, west London.Whose side are you on  Have your say in the comment section The -year-old had flown back briefly from LA for the July  unveiling of the Diana, Princess of Wales memorial statue. The Sussexes have their own security in the US, but sources said the privately paid-for team have no authority whatsoever in the UK.And one royal source has now told Page Six : “If Harry goes, he will want to have security for him and his family. If and when he decides to go back to the UK, he needs security.” The couple have not announced any official travel plans for  as yet but it has been widely believed they would attend the service in memory of the Duke of Edinburgh who died last April at the age of . This would be the first time Lilbet would meet her paternal side of her family as Meghan has not ed to the UK since the couple officially quit royal le in March  and lost their taxpayer-funded police protection. The Mirror has contacted the Sussexes for a comment.  On Saturday, Harryaposs legal representatives said that he has filed a claim for judicial review because he wants to fund the security himself, rather than ask taxpayers to foot the bill. He has argued that his private protection team in the US does not have the necessary jurisdiction abroad, or access to UK intelligence that is needed to keep his family safe.In a statement to PA news agency, the legal representative for the Duke said: “The UK will always be Prince Harry ’s home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in. “With the lack of police protection, comes too great a personal risk. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. “In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable toto his home.” The legal representative added: “Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.  “While his role within the Institution has changed, his profile as a member of the Royal Family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.” The bid for a judicial review was filed in September. Dai Davies, former head of Scotland Yard’s royal protection unit, told the Mirror: If ever there was a proper credible threat to Prince Harry or his family then the Met would take the appropriate action. “If he or his family were toto Britain in an official capacity or to support the Queen during the Platinum Jubilee events I’m sure he would be afforded the necessary protection. “I would argue robustly against his case that he is not safe in the UK. If ever the British intelligence services did discover a threat to him and his family they are hardly going to sit on it. It appears that Harry is creating scenarios that do not exist.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Annie Webster, , wired £,. to her then-partner Shawn OaposMalley, who was on the run from police following the shooting in Bolton. OaposMalley, from Warrington, was wanted by police in relation to a shooting in Bolton on September , , when a house was sprayed with bullets. He was jailed for  years at Liverpool Crown Court in September, after being convicted for the attack which he organised on behalf of Warrington criminal Leon Cullen.His prison sentence also related to the torture of two men at a remote cannabis farm, where he tied, beat and threatenedthem with weapons including a pickaxe and sledgehammer, the Liverpool Echo reports. In July, Bolton Crown Court heard how OaposMalleyaposs partner Webster sent thousands of pounds to him while he was on the run in Dubai in relation to a gangland shooting. When police visited Websteraposs home in January  she told them she had split from OaposMalley in November  and was no longer in contact with him. On March , , police executed a warrant at Websteraposs home in Warrington, when she was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. During a search of her house police recovered a number of items including a Western Union Money Transfer Document in her name, an Emirates Economy Boarding Pass in her name and a receipt voucher for a Dubai-based law firm. From a storage area under the stairs in her home, police found a money transfer receipt for £. dated February , , a Ghaya Brand Hotel luggage claim ticket, a money transfer receipt dated February , , and her passport. Following a police search and interview, Webster pleaded guilty to concealing, disguising, converting, transferring or removing criminal property. A charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice will also lay on file. Webster, of Cumberland Street, Warrington, was sentenced to a two-year community order with a -day rehabilitation activity requirement at Bolton Crown Court back in July last year.  But she appeared back in Liverpool Crown Court today where she admitted breaching the terms of her community order. Rebecca Smith, prosecuting, told the court Webster has so far completed five days of the rehabilitation activity requirement since the community order was imposed last summer. However, the -year-old failed to attend two planned appointments with probation in September and November . Websteraposs defence barrister, Kate Morley, told the court her client suffers with anxiety and depression and finds it easier to engage on the telephone as opposed to leaving her home to attend office appointments at times. Ms Morley said Webster had missed the appointments in September and November due to childcare issues with her six-year-old son, who was unwell and has had to have six teeth removed.The court heard Webster also had to self-isolate after her mum tested positive for Covid- until she received a negative test result.Ms Morley said while her client should have picked up the phone and informed probation of this she didnapost and she apologises for that.  The court heard Webster is now working in a local bar and hasnapost committed any other offences. Ms Morley said: She has attended today despite her father sadly suffering a heart attack and passing away last week. Sentencing, Judge Robert Trevor-Jones said: Iaposm quite sure that when you were sentenced to this community order back in June last year you would have been told what would happenyou failed to comply with it, so here you are now because of that. The judge said that while he had the power to revoke Websteraposs community order and resentence her to imprisonment, he was not going to do that on the grounds that this is her first conviction and first breach, and because she has a six-year-old son. However, he warned thatWebster continues not to meet the requirements of the community order she will be brought back to court to face the consequences. Webster was handed a fine of £ which must be paid over the next six months.

Another incident claimed a toddler was left to sit with dried faeces on his leg and another child was trapped in the toilet crying and shaking, according to the file. The horrying message said they wouldnapost be surprisedOfsted donapost turn up by the end of the week at the centre in Enderby, Leicestershire.But it was quickly taken down and was replaced with a notice attempting to reassure parents it had been posted in error by a member of staff at the firmaposs head office, reports Leicestershire Live.The biggest issue to emerge from the post referred to an incident last July when a child almost wandered out of the nursery and into the car park via a gate that had supposedly been left open by a staff member. It told how the staff member reported the incident to the then-manager and deputy manager. However the incident was not reported to the totaposs family, the head office or Ofsted, the company told the publication.  The company said the head office was only made aware of the incident in early January and that it had contacted the childaposs parents to inform them of what had happened. It added that an investigation into several incidents is currently underway with a new management team now running the nursery. Staff also acknowledged that workers did not whistle-blow to superiors after realising the management had not reported the incident however employees have since retrained to report such issues in future. The letter also detailed how a pre-school boy was trapped in the toilet for some time, leaving them visibly shaking and crying when let out. It claimed that the incident happened when a staff member was told to close the door to the bathroom to stop children running in and out and did not check the cubicles to seeany children were still left inside. Welcome Nurseries said the door was accidentally closed while the child was inside but staff then realised and ed to let him out. Other issues reported in the accidental post included a staff member wiping babiesapos bottoms with antibacterial wipes instead of wet wipes, causing the babies to have sore and bleeding bottoms. Meanwhile a cook was left to supervise pre-school children alone with no qualications to do so, it claimed. A child in soiled nappy was left unattended for so long that faeces was stuck to his leg and took  minutes to remove. One parent, whose child attends the nursery, said: The entire post is very worrying but my child attends the nursery section so I am particularly concerned that a member of staff was using antibacterial wipes on the babiesapos bottoms. I definitely havenapost been told about it and only found out due to the letter. We have to provide our own baby wipes so there was literally no excuse for them to use anything , they are completely dferent. They have covered staff mistakes up and we wouldnapost have known about itthe letter wasnapost posted. The nursery was already unreliable generally before this and had caused some concern, but hearing about a child escaping in the summer makes me worry , as a parent, will I find outmy child has been put at risk  Itaposs just a lot to hide. If theyaposd spoken with parents immediately at the time, there would have been some angry people, sure, but itaposs a lot better than keeping it a secret. The parent is looking to move their child to an alternative nursery in the near future. They added: The trust is gone with them. Iaposm having to move them to another nursery, which is a big disruption for a developing child, but itaposs something Iaposm having to do to ensure they are safe. Welcome Nurseries confirmed the management in charge of Smarties Nursery has changed since the incidents in question, and that the company was tackling the situation as a matter or urgency. The spokesperson said: We can confirm that we received an email of concern on the th January regarding alleged incidents that took place around July last year, under previous management. We can also confirm that we had no prior knowledge of the incidents until the email was sent to us. The safety and well-being of all our children are our number one priority and we immediately carried out a full investigation. It was alleged that a child managed to escape from the nursery into the car park. Whilst this allegation was unfounded, on investigation it was found that a gate was left open which was seen on CCTV by the receptionist, who acted immediately before the child went out of the gate. We also investigated further incidents which occurred around the same time in which a child was left in the bathroom on their own. Our investigation found that a child had entered the bathroom area and a member of staff not knowing he was there closed the door. Both incidents were reported to the previous management team who are no longer with the company, however these were not reported onward or investigated at the time. These incidents fall well below our standard of care and we have since retrained our staff. We are continuing to work with our parents and can assure all parents that we take all concerns seriously and act on them. We profusely apologise to all our children and parents that these incidents occurred and that we were not made aware of them sooner. We have not yet finished our investigations in this matter. We have a new management structure in place at the setting. We would also like to thank our parents for their continued support. A Leicestershire County Council spokesperson said: “We have very recently been made aware of concerns raised by a parent and will be working with the setting to ensure the appropriate procedures and policies are in place.

Sources say the Duke was known for being rude and having childish obsessions - as he was ridiculed while on the road fulfilling royal duties, reports claim.It comes after reports the embattled Duke of York would allegedly scream and shoutBuckingham Palace servants failed to follow his exact plan for the arrangement of his teddy bears. Now more supposed demanding behaviour has come to light during his term as the UKaposs special representative for trade and investment. It includes suggestions he was privately mocked in the Gulf during his time as a special envoy.  A diplomat says the Prince became known as HBH - His Buffoon Highness. The former deputy head of mission in Bahrain, Simon Wilson, says the royalaposs travelling entourage left people speechless. He told The Times Andrew flew out a team which included his equerries and private secretaries. His valet would be equipped with a huge ironing board to ensure his clothes were perfectly pressed, it was claimed.  The diplomat, who had previously hosted the Duke, added that Andrew was rude and boorish and wasnapost well-liked. Mr Wilson explained he was known as a buffoon because of his childish obsession with doing the exact opposite of what had been agreed. He immediately warned that Andrewaposs private le would “willy-nilly, intrude into his public role” – and that he could be “going off with Ghislaine Maxwell to a nightclub” during his private time, it was claimed.Andrew has effectively been banished from the royal family less than  hours after learning a civil sex case against him in New York will go ahead.  The latest awkward anecdotes come after Tuesdayaposs claims that Andrew sketched out a plan for how his five teddies and cuddly toys should be positioned on his bed every night. Ex protection officer Paul Page tells ITV ’s Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile that would “scream and shout”his servants failed to place them exactly how he wanted. He supplied a handwritten guide is said to have included two hippos, a black panther and bears, as well as three cushions called aposDaddyapos, aposDucksapos and aposPrinceapos. It showed exactly where to place blankets, as well as five toys and a fur, which had ribbons that had to hang off the side of the bed, it is said. Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile host Ranvir Singh unravels the story of how Maxwell sank into shame and disgrace through her friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. And will also explore how Andrew became embroiled in the scandal as he faces his own possible civil court case brought by Virginia Giuffre. Andrew has strenuously denied the allegations made by Ms Giuffre against him.

Head of Prince Andrew High School, Craig Campbell, in Nova Scotia sent an email to families explaining the name change - branding the decision exciting news. The email explained: The name of a school should be reflective of our school community and uphold our values as a safe and inclusive learning space for all. “Our hope is to continue to build our identity as a positive, supportive and respectful community, with a name to match.” The school was named in honour of the Queenaposs son in  after he was born. However, the name has been a point of concern since  - when Andrew was accused of having sex with an underage girl trafficked by paedophile friend Jeffrey Epstein.  Officials in the school originally formed committees in  to discuss a name change after the Duke of York was taken off royal duties as allegations against him began to circulate, despite his denials of any wrongdoing, reports New York Post. One mother of pupils at the school and chair of the school advisory council, Belinda Oxner, said in : As mother-of-three daughters, I find it very dficult to have that name on a building with the allegations and the associations now with the Prince Andrew name. The school will choose a new name in time ready for the new school year in September, the principal said. Mr Campbell added: We’re ready and excited to take this next step. It comes after the Queen stripped Andrew of his royal titles and patronages, meaning he will fight his accuser’s Manhattan lawsuit as a “private citizen.” A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: With The Queen’s approval and agreement, The Duke of York’s military affiliations and Royal patronages have been ed to The Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen. A royal source said: All of The Duke’s roles have been handed back to The Queen with immediate effect for redistribution to other Members of the Royal Family - will notto The Duke of York. The Duke of York will no longer use the style ‘His Royal Highness’ in any official capacity. Prince Andrew served in the Royal Navy as a helicopter pilot and saw active service in the Falklands War. The royal said he stopped sweating after suffering an overdose of adrenaline while being shot at in the conflict.  The Duke revealed this medical condition in a BBC Newsnight interview when addressing Ms Giuffreaposs description of him sweating profusely. The royal has denied all allegations made against him, including claims he was sweating during a meeting with Ms Gufre. Prince Andrew has lost the following military affiliations:Honorary Air Commodore at RAF Lossiemouth Commodore-in-Chief of the Fleet Air Arm Colonel of the Grenadier Guards – Colonel Colonel in Chief of the Princess Louise Fusiliers of Canada Colonel in Chief of the Queenaposs York RangersColonel in Chief of the Royal Highland FusiliersColonel in Chief of the Royal Irish Regiment , rd and th and The Ulster Defence Regiment Colonel in Chief of the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic RegimentColonel in Chief of the Small Arms School Corps Colonel in Chief of the Royal LancersRoyal Colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers, nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland Colonel in Chief of the Yorkshire Regiment Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON The QueenPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkBuckingham PalaceRoyal NavyFalklands WarNewsnightEducationRoyal FamilySchoolsArmed forcesSecondary schoolThe Falklands\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And at the weekend, Harry revealed the reason why heaposs yet to bring his family to his homeland. He claims his private security arrangements are not enough to ensure his family’s safety and privacy here. He and Meghan are no longer entitled to police protection.  Harry now wants to pay for specialist police protection, but the Home Office has ruled this out – and he has applied for a judicial review against the decision. If the row canapost be solved, Harry might choose not to bring his young children to the UK.And with the Queen no longer flying long-haul, royal expert Phil Dampier told The Sun itaposs a big possibility she is never going to meet her granddaughter Lilibet and has only ever met Archie once or twice.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Harry might come over but it gives Meghan a good excuse not to come and also not to bring the children. Meanwhile, another royal expert previously claimed the Queen finds it dficult that she has been unable to see Harry and Meghan’s children.Speaking in the Channel  documentary : The Queen’s Terrible Year, royal expert Camilla Tominey says it has been hard for the Queen to be so far away from her two great-grandchildren. She said: Iaposm sure the Queen was absolutely delighted to hear the news that the Sussexes were expecting a second child. She continued: But it is dficult for the Queen. She has not been able to see Archie. I think the last time she was able to see Archie in the flesh was November . The only way the Queen will be able to see these children isthey come over to the UK.

Watchdog Which  says their exposé suggests possible discrimination and a breach of UK law.Which  asked almost  mystery shoppers to create real profiles and note the prices quoted by Tinder Plus, a premium package . The premium package features perks such as unlimited Likes and Rewinds and the ability to undo accidental selections. The research showed some gay and lesbian users were paying more, with an average premium of more than %compared to bisexual users, and more than %compared to heterosexual users.Do you use Tinder  Join the discussion in the comment section This trend was driven by the youngest age group, with Which  finding that gay and lesbian people aged  to  paid £. on average - % more than heterosexual users aged under and % more than bisexual users under  . When it came to age, those in the  to -year-old age bracket paid % more - a £ dference - and the over s paid % more - a £. dference - on average for a -month Tinder Plus subscription. Across the entire mystery shopping exercise, quotes for a yearaposs access to Tinder Plus ranged from £. to £., with  dferent prices quoted in total. The watchdog said Tinder did not make clear the full extent of how it applied personalised pricing on the app, with no explanation to customers that their personal data could be exploited in this way.  Which  said it had reported its findings to the Equality and Human Rights Commissionand the Information Commissioneraposs Officeand called on them to investigate whether there had been a breach of UK law. The Equality Act  makes it unlawful to charge people of one sexual orientation more than others unless there is a clear justication for this. Tinder said it was categorically untrue that our pricing structure discriminates in any way by sexual preference. It told Which  that older people did have to pay more in some countries, but said the price dference was a discount for younger users. Which  said this was not made clear to people using the app. The consumer group noted that it was occasionally justiable under UK law to offer age-based price iations for the same product or service, such as discounts to over-s or students, where it can be shown there is a legitimate basis for this. However, it said that in the case of Tinder it was unclear as to why over-s were paying more. Tinderaposs terms of use and privacy policy did not make users aware of such vastly dferent pricing, instead referring only to processing inidualsapos data to deliver and improve its services, to help keep users safe and to provide them with advertising that may be of interest. Tinder is owned by the Texas-based Match Group and made US . billion in global revenue in . Which  director of policy and advocacy, Rocio Concha, said: Our research uncovered concerning evidence that people using Tinder could unknowingly be facing higher charges because of their sexual orientation and age. This suggests possible unlawful price discrimination, whether or not it is intentional on Tinderaposs part, and potentially unlawful processing of personal data. We are calling for the EHRC and the ICO to investigate this issue further. If regulators decide that Tinderaposs personalised pricing is breaking the law, then the dating app giant must face strong action. A Tinder spokeswoman told Which : Tinder is free to use and the vast majority of our members enjoy our app without upgrading to the paid experience. However, we do offer a iety of subscription options to help our members stand out and match with new people more efficiently.  Tinder operates a global business and, in some geographies, we offer discounted subscriptions to younger members. In addition, we frequently offer promotional rates which can y based on factors like location orof subscription. No other demographic information is considered in our pricing structure. The spokeswoman added: It is categorically untrue that our pricing structure discriminates in any way by sexual preference. Any reporting or inference is patently  and outrageous. There are no truths to the Which  mystery shopping activity. An EHRC spokeswoman said: As Britainaposs equality regulator it is our job to protect, uphold and enforce equality laws. We take reports of discrimination very seriously. This report of potential discrimination by Tinder is concerning. We will consider these findings by Which  and respond in due course.

All frontline workers in England face the sackthey have not had two Covid vaccines by April , meaning they must get their first dose by February . The unvaccinated nurse, of London, told of her outrage at the mandate and called it an infringement of her human rights. How can you force me to put something in my body andI disagree then Iaposm out of a job and potentially lose my home  she told My London.I donapost know how Iaposm going to pay my mortgage, I donapost know how Iaposm going to pay my bills but itaposs a risk Iaposm willing to take for my human rights.  The nurse is based in the east London borough of Newham where  per cent of residents are yet to receive their first dose. She claims she was handed a letter from her employer stating that her team must be vaccinated by the end of March or leave their jobs. But the message has proven fruitless in persuading her to change her mind. As a healthcare professional I should be given the opportunity to make an informed decision about things affecting my body, she said. I hope someone somewhere will have common sense and bring about some sort of change. I thinkwe accept this then it opens a dangerous door to other things that the Government or other corporations can impose on our livelihoods. The nurse, who is of African descent, believes that vaccine hesitancy is strong in black and ethnic minority communities, and suggested reasons for this could be fear, hidden agendas and issues of mistrust.  Recent figures show that the  most unvaccinated areas in the UK are all in London. Almost one third of Londoners still have not received their first dose of the vaccine, according to Government data. Most of Londonaposs boroughs are lagging far behind other parts of the UK, with Westminster ranking worst overall for first dose uptake at just . per cent. By stark contrast, the five areas with the highest first dose vaccination rates in the UK are all in Scotland according to figures from January . Argyll and Bute is the most vaccinated upper tier local authority in the UK where . per cent of residents have had the first jab. Dr Raheelah Ahmad, director for global engagement at City, University of London, has studied vaccine uptake in England.We found that Asian and Black people are, respectively, twice and . times less likely to accept the Covid- vaccine than White British people, she said.The expert also highlighted the importance of analysing ethnic minority inclusion in the fight against vaccine hesitancy. Population characteristics can be used to infer vulnerability of certain communities to Covid, or to the likelihood of high levels of vaccine hesitancy, she added. Communities harder hit by the virus, or at risk of being so, stand to benefit from greater resource allocation than their population size alone would suggest. This could partly explain why the total number of people living in Newham who have received a first dose stands at almost  per cent lower than top-of-the-table Bromley. Bromley is the most vaccinated borough in London, with . per cent of residents receiving the first dose. Just  per cent of Bromleyaposs population consists of black and ethnic minority communities, while these same communities make up over  per cent of Newham, according to an ONS population census in . The London borough of Kensington and Cha is the second most unvaccinated UTLA in the UK where just . per cent of residents have had the first dose. Professor Azeem Majeed, chair in primary care and public health at Imperial College London, suggested that low vaccination rates among Londoners could also be driven by a mobile population. He said: With many living in the capital shorter term, for work or study, it can be dficult to send vaccine appointments because of inaccurate address information. For example, some Londoners will have had their vaccines overseas and won’t show up in official statistics. He added: “We need to continue to encourage people living in London and across the UK to get vaccinated and reduce their risk of catching COVID- and having a more serious illness.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON NHSUniversity of LondonImperial CollegeHuman rightsCoronavirus vaccineCoronavirusHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Kasey Clarke, , traded in her job as a producer to start her own firm.Kasey had worked at the BBC for  years before leaving in  to pursue baking full-time, MyLondon reports. She now runs her own successful business, Sweet Cakey Thing, which she launched in March  after spending years developing her craft and finding her niche - as well as driving for Uber in Central London on the side.These ventures combined make her up to £, a year, and she credits the flexibility of Uber for facilitating her success. In  I went full-time into baking, and financially I wasnapost  per cent prepared for that, Kasey said. I was able to keep myself going for a couple of years before I had to find another source of income to support me.I tried other avenues, working as a warehouse operative for John Lewis, as a pollster during the Brexit campaign, teaching cake decorating skills... but all of these things had the problem of being very fixed, in terms of time, in terms of income.I found juggling those very rigid timetables around impromptu cake orders very hard - I wanted to find something that was flexible to my primary needs of building my business. There are plenty of problems with the gig economy, but one thing that can be said for the likes of Uber is its flexibility. You can work when you want, where you want, and that prospect was very appealing to Kasey. I was doing the midnight sht at John Lewis, schlepping mattresses from one end of the warehouse to the other, and I kept hearing this advert for Uber. I was like: aposYou know what, I love driving, Iaposve never considered being a taxi driver before, and these guys seem to have made it really easy for me to do that. Let me look into itapos, she said. Kasey signed up for Uber, which enabled her to get her finances under control, sort out her credit score, and to be able to take on the sorts of baking jobs she really wanted to do.  Rather than keeping on churning out kidsapos birthday cakes, Kasey could start working on the beautul wedding cakes sheaposd always dreamed of, and then she started developing Sweet Cakey Thing. Sweet Cakey Thing is an award-winning naughty, natural, outrageous indulgence,  per cent aposfree fromapos cake in a jar, Kasey explains. Itaposs perfect for paleo, gluten intolerance, coeliacs, yogis, gym bunnies, and people who just want to enjoy a clean diet with absolutely no crap in there at all, just  per cent natural whole foods. Kasey spent the time leading up to the first Covid lockdown in her kitchen developing recipes, launching the brand at a yoga studio pop-up in March . Shortly afterwards, the country went into lockdown and Sweet Cakey Thing had to go entirely online. Kasey continued driving for Uber, which she says requires a great deal of management and responsibility in order to balance her business and her side hustle, but her earnings show how well it can pay off.  I start my day in Hertfordshire, where I am now, and I just go where the rides take me, she said. Iniably they take me into London, I find myself there almost every day. I tend to work less to an area and more to the clock: I clock in at six, with a view to doing six hours and be done by  so I can get back and focus on other things, getting to the kitchen or whatever needs to be done, she continued. Wherever I find myself around  oaposclock is where Iaposm looking to start making my way back towards home. Iaposm near Stansted Airport, but I find myself in East London, or South London, or West London, Central London pretty quickly. All roads lead to London, she laughed. Despite how much she loves driving for Uber, meeting new people every day and seeing every corner of London, Kasey hopes that  will be the year she can take Sweet Cakey Thing full time. Iaposm looking forward to building on where Iaposve got to in the past six months, expanding the range with new flavours, and Iaposm hoping to do a pop-up tour in the summer, she said. All of that means Iaposll be needing to spend more time with Sweet Cakey Thing and less time on the road. My TfL licence expires this August, and my agenda is to not need to review it, so come August Iaposll be a full-time entrepreneur, working on my cake business. Come August, itaposll just be aposthank you very muchapos to Uber for having gotten me to this point, for supporting me in building my dream. Dreams like Kaseyaposs are made by people shopping small and supporting local independent business, which is something many Londoners have been doing a lot more of throughout Covid. She hopes the sentiment continues as the world continues to open up again, and that people continue to shop small, and shop often.

The incredible scenes were snapped at one of the fast-food chainaposs restaurants in Borehamwood, Herts.Normally, drivers in cars are seen ordering grub from the drive-thru, but many were understandably left baffled when a woman and her steed joined the line of vehicles waiting.When she got to the window, she dismounted and told the employee what she wanted, Bristol Livereports. Her horseaposs snout was then seen hilariously poking its snout curiously into the window - probably trying to inspect the aromas of McDonaldaposs food. The woman was then seen trotting on with a coffee in one hand as she chatted away on her mobile phone. It is unclear whether she ordered any food for her steed or decided to keep their diet to carrots and hay. Incredibly, it is not the first time McDonaldaposs customers have seen someone ordering from the drive-thru on horseback.In December, dad-of-three Simon White saw the hilarious event unfold while stopping to eat at his local McDonaldaposs in Caerphilly, Wales.

It is the first in Tennessee to challenge a new law that allows religious adoption agencies to deny service to families whose religious or moral beliefs do not match the provideraposs, their attorney told Knox News.Gabriel and Elizabeth realised they could not have biological children of their own last year and later found a child in Florida who they were excited to foster with plans to adopt, the publication added. They claim they were first told by Holston that the organisation would assist them with their out-of-state placement. But on the day they were due to begin training, they were told it only helped families who shared their Christian beliefs and the couple were unable to complete the fostering process, according to the lawsuit.  Elizabeth said: “I felt like I’d been punched in the gut. It was the first time I felt discriminated against because I am Jewish. It was very shocking and it was very hurtful that the agency seemed to think that a child would be better off in state custody than with a loving family like us.” The Rutan-Rams are currently fostering and hope to adopt a teenage girl through a separate agency with hopes of adopting again in the future, according to the US publication. Holston recently acknowledged receiving public money to offer foster care placement and training for the Tennessee Department of Child Services. It came when it sued the Biden administration last December over new federal regulations. The measures stopped government-funded health and human services programmes from discriminating due to religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, sex or same-sex marriage status. A spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Child Services and the Tennessee Attorney Generalaposs offices declined to comment on the pending litigation. Alex Luchenitser, associate vice president and associate legal director at Americans United, issued a statement on behalf of the Rutan-Ram family. It read: The Tennessee Constitution, like the US Constitution, promises religious freedom and equality for everyone. Tennessee is reneging on that promise by allowing a taxpayer-funded agency to discriminate against Liz and Gabe Rutan-Ram because they are Jews.

A written agreement had been drawn up between them, he said. The belongings in question include a notebook found close to Laundrieaposs body, but Mr Bertolino declined to reveal which family would be keeping it. A probe into Gabbyaposs murder is still ongoing.

Meredith, who works as a hairdresser and fitness coach, went from a dress size of  to a dress size of six in the space of two years. Meredith, from Texas, US, said: My whole le I was overweight and no matter what fad diet I tried, I would lost a little bit and then after a few months I would give up and gain it all back plus extra.When I was , I was faced with serious health issues and was concerned about my overall health and future given my weight so everyday, I was suffering from headaches, rashes, nausea, and doctors could never find a problem besides a thyroid condition.One day, I realised my health had reached this low point because of my weight and thataposs when I made the decision to start my weight loss journey. After getting engaged, the wedding motivated me to lose weight because when I was dress shopping, I had trouble fitting in dresses or doing the zip up at several stores. It was really discouraging but by my wedding day, I felt beautul and although I wasnapost at my goal weight, I was so proud of what I had accomplished. My husband has supported me so much on this journey and heaposs always encouraged me to stay on track. Meredith first started losing weight by joining a gym in August  and changing her eating habits. The fitness fanatic went from weighing st lb to st lb in just two years and is now helping others do the same. She added: In a little over two years, I lost all of that weight whilst gaining muscle mass from simply counting my macros and eating in the correct calorie deficit along with weight training six days a week. My sizes changed completely I went from a XL to a small in clothes and my bra size went from a DDD to a B. I started posting on social media when I first started losing weight and the support I was getting from others was amazing so I pushed even harder and shared more to show others that it could be done.  I then started giving others advice at that point and then found a true passion in helping others. My husband cooks for us daily and at the beginning of my journey, he worked away from home so he would spend his days teaching me everything nutrition wise so I was able to cook the right food for myself when he was away. I am still in the process of transforming my body and am still currently in a calorie deficit as of now. Although I am way pass my goal, my plan is to stay in a deficit for a little bit longer to target certain stubborn areas and then in a few months I will be doing a small bulk to strictly gain muscle mass.

The actor, presenter, comedian, author, and DJ is truly a Jack of all trades and now heaposs fronting a Sky History show that examines famous sightings, called UFO : Conspiracies.Craig, , said that UFOs can come in aposall dferent shapes and sizesapos, and heaposs opened up about his own spooky sighting. He said he isnapost sure what was behind the phenomenon, but on the documentary he examines evidence alongside expert astrophysicist and award-winning author Sarah Cruddas to try to get to the bottom of it.  What do you think about UFOs  Let us know in the comments...Craig became a national favourite when he starred as David Lister in hit comedy Red Dwarf, where he was, mostly, the last human alive, floating through space and encountering aliens. Craig said that his interest in UFOs, also known as Unidentied Aerial Phenomenabegan in those early days, but he was afraid to admit it. Speaking to Sky History, he said: Back in the day you would never say so because people would think you were a bit of a crank. Now, the Americans have released all this footage that clearly shows these UFOs, and UAPs are there. Iaposm not saying theyaposre not aliens but they do exist. What are they   Do the Russians and Chinese have technology that is so much more advanced from our own  That is as frightening as aliens to be sure. How can craft travel , mph then stop instantly  The G-Force alone from that would turn a human being into mush  Are they drones, or are they robots  Some of them fly and then go underwater. We have footage of that from fighter jets and aircraft carriers. What are they  Me and my friend were in Galway once, sat in his garden and these weird things flew over. The next day, there was like, lots of stuff on the news about it. People had been phoning in to report seeing alien craft flying over the skies of Galway. Me and my mate saw that but I donapost know what it was   Working alongside Sarah on the TV show, Craig is examining famous sightings and they look at a sleepy Welsh village thataposs the scene of a major sighting, evidence collected from a aposcrash siteapos, and rumours of a military cover up. Craig said: The Rendlesham Forest case is really interesting because it was the American military who reported seeing all these weird lights in the woods. These are highly trained officers who arenapost going to mistake a car headlight for a spaceship. You do wonder what they actually saw there. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. A lot of the footage thataposs just been released by the American Air Force is very compelling. You can see these things on film and theyaposre all dferent shapes. A lot of people report seeing this pyramid-shaped craft. It doesnapost have an engine and itaposs just thrusting forward and flying through the air. This pyramid shape comes up quite a lot, from many dferent sightings. Thereaposs a lot of dferent kind of craft that people have claimed to see: barrel-shaped, disc-shaped and boomerang-shaped craft.  Unfortunately, with this series, hard evidence is really thin on the ground and thataposs one thing I found a bit frustrating. Although all of the stories are told with conviction and are certainly very believable He added: I now know that these things exist. Theyaposre not a figment of anyoneaposs imagination. Even the American government admits that now. Itaposs proved to me that Iaposm not a Fraggle. Unexplained Aerial Phenomena are out there, we just donapost know what they are. Sarah Cruddas added: “We are living in an incredible time for space exploration, but we are only just beginning to scratch the surface of what is out there. Marrying together Craig’s passion and enthusiasm with my own thirst for evidence and an application of science, we have been able to explore what is going on in our skies like never before. Some of the answers are likely to be stranger than anything you could ever imagine.” Craig Charles: UFO Conspiracies aired on January  on Sky History.

One -year-old son has unfortunatley witnessed just that recently - and to make matters worse, the incredibly awkward moment was caught on camera. Joseph Pena had been away from his family in Colorado, USA, for the last two years completing military service in Germany.Heaposd decided to try and surprise his parents with a visit home and showed up unnanounced, giving his mum and dad a much bigger surprise than heaposd bargained for.His mum Kaati,  and dad Richard, , were aposcaught in the actapos as Joseph barged into their room without knocking first.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The couple refer to what their son saw as them apostalkingapos as this is the codeword they used for sex when the kids were little. Their very intimate aposdiscussionapos understandably left Joseph mortied and unable to face his parents for a while. Mum Kaati recalls: We were surprised and beyond embarrassed. My husband and I were talking, which was our code word for sex when the kids were little, and we were in the moment when the door got kicked open. I screamed because I saw my son and of course realised he saw everything exposed. She continued to say: We had no clue that our son Joseph was coming home on his RR and he told his sister Josephine, the camera lady, that he wanted to surprise us.The online responses have been epic! The comments are on fire and most are roasting our son for not knocking. To this day it’s still being viewed, and comments are still pouring in.Our poor son was scarred during his RR and spent most of his time with his sister and his girlfriend. The mum added that Joseph then aposavoidedapos coming over to their house for the remainder of his down time, instead opting to text and call his parents. We were okay with it because he needed to enjoy his RR and not be scarred by what he saw. I’m sure he’s trying his best to erase the visual memory of the incident, but living with us will only remind him of how Eve and Adam conceived the whole world.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

American blogger and mum, Alexis often shares videos of her travels, useful tips and destination recommendations on TikTok, where sheaposs known as @worldtraveladventurers. But in a recent video, that has been viewed more than , times, she sparked a debate about travel etiquette as she asked what the right age is for kids to be allowed in upper classes on planes. Do you think kids should be allowed to fly business class  she captioned the post. The video shows her two children, Ellie and Christophe, flying first class on a number of trips.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. If parents can buy them a seat in business class, then they have the right to be there, she says in the video. We do think itaposs important though, for parents to teach kids to have proper behaviour on flights. Alexis explains that they didnapost travel in premium cabins until her kids were at least four years old because at that age, they had more self-control and could manage their behaviour better. Flying in business class gives her kids the freedom to lie down, sleep, play games and watch films - and the other passengers rarely even know theyaposre there. She posed the controversial question to TikTok users, who were keen to give their opinion. Since being posted, the video has racked up almost , likes and  comments from ided viewers, with some saying they shouldnapost be allowed.One person said: Absolutely not. They should create a childrenaposs suite. Another added: I think Iaposd be madI saw them.

No way Iaposm sitting in st and sheaposs where. I mean there are full-grown adults that didnapost know how to act on an aircraft sooo, said someone .There were also a few horror stories about babies ruining flights, like this one: I recently flew first class home from Hawaii and there was an infant who cried  screamed the entire way.

However, some people have branded her actions petty. She filmed the other womanaposs reaction on a Ring doorbell, uploading the footage to TikTok to share what her neighbour is like with the rest of the world.

She then huffed and puffed her way back into her house after noticing what had happened. Payton captioned the video: Neighbour from hell reaction to grease on the trash cans!

So when Tymarahaposs arm is scanned with a phone, All-Star - which die-hard fans will recall plays out as we get to know Shrek and his grouchy bachelor lestyle in the opening credits - will play out on Spoty.Thankfully, it works perfectly. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Tymarah from Greenhithe, Kent said: I thought it was so funny and it actually worked! I just think the song and film is hilarious.Personally, I donapost think Iaposll regret it. I have quite a lot of tattoos and itaposs just a few lines on the back of my arm. Iaposve seen far worse tattoos on people! Shrek-mad Tymarah first saw the comedy adventure at the cinema as a child and declares she has been obsessed ever since, much to her friendsapos amusement. The eyelash technician explained: Itaposs kind of like an ongoing joke between me and my friends that I like Shrek. I think we spoke about getting a Shrek tattoo once and whenever we are on a long drive I just play the song. I thought this would be better than a Shrek tattoo as it means something to me and my friends, not just a random Shrek tattoo! Tymarah had the unusual tat done at Sacred Empire Tattoo  Piercing in Tonbridge on Friday, January th. Sheaposd initially booked in to have a Japanese dragon inked on her forearm, however, before getting out of the chair, she askedthe artist could also throw add the small Spoty Code tattoo on her upper arm.  Although it took a four-hour session to complete her dragon tattoo, it took just ten minutes for the artist, who is also a friend of Tymarah, to add the usable code. The artist made a stencil using a code Tymarah herself had screenshotted from her Spoty app. According to Tymarah: She knows Iaposm crazy so she didnapost even blink an eyelid! If they change the software and it doesnapost work I wouldnapost care, itaposs a personal tattoo on my body and means something to me. I have other amazing art pieces tattooed on me and they donapost have any meaning, soanything Iaposm more likely to regret them than a tattoo with meaning.Tymarah believes that the ink will serve as a reminder of my group of friends and our humour, remarking that lots of people get matching tattoos with friends. Looking ahead to the future, she added: I think it will be so funny to explain to my kids or grandkids what the tattoo is for and play them the song. So many people have tattoos about movie or TV characters, I personally donapost think this is any dferent. Tymarah has since posted a vid of her getting the tattoo on her TikTok, @itstymarah, clocking up almost k likes at the time of writing.The video said: When you definitely just made the best decision of your le... Tell me Iaposm wrong  If every comment is youaposre wrong Iaposm going to die LOL. Thankfully there was plenty of support in the comments, with even the official Spoty account commenting to declare you are an ALL-STAR. Reflecting on how she felt about any potential criticism of her body art, Tymarah reasoned: Personally I think people get super sensitive about other peopleaposs tattoos, itaposs not on your body so why would you care  Have you opted for a funny or unusual tattoo Get in touch.

Say the ball costs X. Then the bat costs  more, so it is X + . So we have bat + ball  X + . because together they cost .. This means X +   ., then X  ., so X  .. This means the ball costs  cents and the bat costs . . If it takes  machines  minutes to make  widgets, then it takes  machine  minutes to make  widget .

His visitation rights have been suspended until February, unless the dad gets vaccinated before then. The judgement came after the dad had requested an extra day with his child over the holiday period, according to local reports in Quebec, Canada.Whose side are you on  Have your say in the comment section The mum contested the request after learning from his social media posts that he was not vaccinated. She further requested a suspension of his visitation rights, claiming he would be a conspirator and anti-vaccine. The child has received both their jabs, but the mum lives with her partner and other children under the age of five who are not yet able to get vaccinated. The judge said: In these circumstances, it is not in the best interests of any of the three children that Monsieur can exercise access toat this time.  for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.This is not the first reported case of a parent being denied visitation for not having their Covid- vaccine. In New York, a dad was banned from visiting his daughter unless he becomes double-jabbed or agrees to weekly Covid tests. The ruling was made by a New York City orce judge, who suspended the parentaposs visitation rights to see the three-year-old girl until he agrees to either option. Matthew Cooper, who is presiding over the estranged coupleaposs orce and custody dispute, wrote in his ruling: “Here, in-person parental access by the defendant is not in the child’s best interests, and there are exceptional circumstances that support its suspension. “The dangers of voluntarily remaining unvaccinated during access with a child while the Covid- virus remains a threat to children’s health and safety cannot be understated. “Unfortunately, and to my mind, incomprehensibly, a sizeable minority, seizing upon misinformation, conspiracy theories, and muddled notions of ‘inidual liberty,’ have refused all entreaties to be vaccinated.” The ruling requires the unnamed dad to either get the jab or present a weekly PCR test in addition to a biweekly antigen test within  hours of a scheduled visit. He currently visits his daughter every other weekend. The judge wrote that the couple split in  and the proceedings have been contentious with the two wrangling over custody of their daughter. The child resides mostly with her mother in Manhattan, where she attends preschool.

Members of SAS E Squadron will lead a rescueRussian troops and armour pour deep into Ukraine.As many as , Russian combat forces are now amassed close to Ukraine’s border - including ground troops and amphibious attack personnel.More are pouring into neighbouring Belarus, putting Ukraine’s capital Kiev at riskPresident Vladimir Putin orders a full-scale invasion.Moscow’s commanders have ordered large amounts of multi-launch rocket systems to be transported into Belarus, which could be used as a launch point for an invasion. American President Joe Biden has already warned he believes an attack is “imminent” and bungled by hinting an American response depends on the severity of an incursion.Many observers believe full-scale invasion is unlikely butthat takes place British Foreign Office officials may be rescued by special forces. It is believed crack UK special forces may also be placed strategically within Ukraine acting as military advisers, along with US counterparts.  One security source told the Daily Mirror: “British intelligence is watching developments all over Ukraine but in particular in Crimea, which is occupied by Russian forces. “All of the other manoeuvres may have been a ruse to deflect from Crimea and Putin may want to expand it towards contested Donbas.”Tonight the UK Ministry of Defence told the Daily Mirror: We do not comment on special forces. Ukraine’s troops along a -mile trench border through Donbas, in Donestk and Luhansk, are on high alert for an attack by Moscow’s forces. They are preparing to launch a guerrilla warfare against attacking Russian soldiersthey roll over the frontline, using UK-supplied shoulder-launched NLAW missiles. They have pitted crossing points with anti-tank mines and other defences, preparing to retreat and then launch counter-attacks against an invasion force. Experts warned Russia will act quickly and decisivelyit invades. aposRussia to act quickly and decisively in invasion of Ukraineapos Hugo Crosthwaite, lead analyst for Eurasia at security intelligence firm Dragonfly, said the Russian plan was to get concessions on Ukrainian NATO membership and Donbas. Putin is keen to stop Ukraine from becoming a NATO member but the US has insisted on making no promise. Moscow also wants pro-Russian separatist occupied Donbas to be officially part of Russia and some experts believe sanction threats will not deter the Kremlin. He said: “A Russian invasion of Ukraine is a likely scenario in the coming weeks. “There have been several military and diplomatic developments that point to a sustained severe interstate conflict risk, including Russian troops deploying to Belarus and further efforts by the Kremlin to create a pretext for an attack.  “The combined efforts of the US, the EU and NATO to deter Russia in recent months appear to have failed. “Even the sanctions the US has threatened seem to have had little impact, with Russia having effectively sanction-proofed its economy. “Russia’s military build-up means it can now begin a ground operation or launch a devastating missile and artillery attack at little to no notice. “Rhetoric from the Kremlin has become more belligerent, including unevidenced accusations that the US is training ‘anti-Russia’ units and Ukraine is preparing to attack separatist forces in Donbas - a tactic the Kremlin used in  to justy its annexation of Crimea. “We still doubt that Russian forces would attack Kyiv, either via ground assault or air and missiles, and assess that Russia’s main goal in any military operation would be to force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to resign quickly, and offer wide-ranging concessions from NATO membership to the status of Donbas.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NatoEuropean UnionForeign OfficeMinistry of DefenceJoe BidenVladimir PutinSoldiersSpecial forcesUkraine crisisRussiaDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But now Navalnyaposs team claim to have found thousands of actual photographs of the palace confirming a “striptease” room known as a “hookah” with a stage and a performer’s pole. The striptease hall, hookah, call it what you want, really exists,” says a commentary with a video on the new pictures. “And it looks much worse than we could imagine.”  A computer-generated image shows how the Navalny team had imagined the pole-dancing boudoir a year ago based on leaked plans which also included a casino and aqua disco. A photograph shows what they claim is the striptease room reality in the palace when it was still under construction. “The stage is littered with pillows,” said the commentary.  A pulsating light appears above and behind where the dancer would perform. “We donapost even know how to describe it. A portal  A silhouette of a temple dome ” Other images show the Russian leaderaposs bedroom, a second bedroom and his office, as well as a swimming pool, they claim. The double-headed eagle symbol of Russia is found throughout the palace, appearing to give it an official seal. Amid controversy over the palace stoked by Putin enemy Navalny, a year ago oligarch Arkady Rotenberg denied it belonged to the President and said he owned the sprawling clftop property overlooking the Black Sea. Billionaire Rotenberg is Putin’s former judo sparring partner and perhaps closest friend from childhood. At the time the tycoon explained: “This is a stunning place. We would like to build an apart-hotel there, this is why it has so many rooms.” He told the media without going into detail that he had managed to “become a beneficiary” of the well-guarded property.  The high-security palace reportedly includes a “-storey underground complex” compared with the lair of a James Bond villain. It was also described as “a whole anthill in the rock under the house”. An engineer-turned-whistleblower who reportedly worked on the construction - named only as Viktor - thought of the palace as a “national treasure” suggesting the underground passageways buried in the rock were more ingenious than Dr No’s bunker. The palace designs included on the eighth subterranean floor a balcony - literally a loggia hanging over the sea built into the clf, from which the owner can enjoy wine tasting from the palace stocks, he said. It is, however, far from clear that Putin has ever lived here and a year ago it appeared to be undergoing reconstruction. The Kremlin has denied that it is the President’s private home. Lawyer, anti-corruption campaigner and protest leader Navalny - seen as Putin’s number one enemy - is in jail but is seen in the West as a political prisoner.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet.

It keeps its failures off the front pages.A new year and the catastrophes mount up for the SNP Green alliance. An out of touch and too cautious Covid policy, pupils frightened to go back to the classrooms, the Ferguson shipyard in even more disarray, AE waiting times at an all-time low, retail businesses losing huge sums of money, underfunded local councils being forced to cut services, all while it raises taxes and does not even have the common sense to put off expensive new fire alarm regulations for hard-pressed homeowners. Constantly blaming Westminster is a convenient distraction for now, but these failures and others will not be forgotten come the May council elections.Defending a record like this on the doorstep will be rather dficult, especially since breaking up the UK does not provide convincing answers.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.SEND FOR MORDAUNTIF, or should that be when, Boris Johnson eventually steps down, I hope that the Tories select Penny Mordaunt as their new leader.

A classic example is Scotland Matters, which failed to disclose the London benefactor who contributed £, towards its anti-SNP campaign in the run-up to last year’s Scottish elections.The growing rise of the London think-tank industry and the numerous right-wing think-tanks which fail to reveal who funds them while acting as lobbyists and anonymous front bodies poses a far greater threat to democracy than the rare cases of voter fraud.The Elections Bill seems to be more about disenfranchising some voters than tackling the more important issues, including preventing overseas electors donating to political parties or referendum campaigns.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.KIEV DOES NOT DESERVE SUPPORTSOME media commentators appear to be excited about the prospect of a war over Ukraine, asit would be some video game and not a crisis that in the worst-case scenario could turn into a nuclear confrontation . And the political classes view the crisis as being a useful deflection from their economic and social problems at home. Meanwhile analysis of the origins of the crisis lacks any statesmanlike response, and is replaced by the knee-jerk reaction of sending arms to the regime in Kiev.And it is a regime that rules in Kiev, having come to power in a coup supported by the US and EU, when the pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine won an election. Since then Kiev has been underwritten politically as well as economically and militarily by the West, which at the same time expresses outrage at Russia giving similar support to the breakaway forces in the predominantly-Russian eastern Ukraine. Russian military manoeuvres in Belarus are a provocation, but Nato military manoeuvres in Poland apparently are not so. Sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander it would appear.Meanwhile the regime in Kiev, as corrupt as all its predecessors since independence from the USSR, has been eroding the rights of the Russian-speaking minority still under its control, limiting the use of Russian in political le and in education. More to the point, some present-day Ukrainian nationalists are following in the footsteps of their anti-Semitic forebears by erecting monuments to those who cooperated with the SS in the mass extermination of Jews, Communists and others during the Second World War.

I never understood how it came from your own team-mates and management structure.“I always saidthe coach said to all the players: ‘If you call him a name you’re out’, it stops.”Robert Earnshaw, another former Wales striker, says he was the subject of monkey noises while playing international football abroad.  for further information.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

Credit: Kevin CooperMark BainTwitterEmailJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSchools should be bracing themselves for a further surge in Covid cases following the easing of wider restrictions, a leading union has warned.Department of Education figures suggest the situation in schools over Covid absences is easing, but fears remain that the broader easing of restrictions will have a longer term impact in classrooms.The northern chairperson of a leading teaching union has called on the Executive to send out a strong message to schools that now is not to time for the education sector to relax.Marie O’Shea, from the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation , also questioned whether the figures released by the Department are painting a true picture of what has been happening in schools.“On the ground we are hearing there remains a high percentage of Covid cases affecting schools,” she said, after the Department revealed that in the week January - there was a .% attendance rate of pupils, a rise from .% on the first week back after the Christmas holidays.The number of pupils learning in school rose by .% in the same time, reaching ..The figures also showed that in the week up to January , .% of teachers across the schools were absent due to Covid issues with % of classroom assistants absent and .% of teacher absences covered by either existing staff or substitute teachers,Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “What schools now must guard against is complacency. Seeing restrictions eased across society doesn’t mean this it a time to relax,” said Ms O’Shea.“If anything schools are going to have to be stronger, and we would like to see stronger language used by the Executive in their messaging to education.“We‘ve seen before that schools bear the brunt of any wider easing of restrictions. This time it will be no dferent.“Schools need to be ready as we are likely to see another surge in cases over the next two weeks.“It#s not a coincidence that the Department absence figures are showing a slow down at a time when there has been a change in the testing regime. It may look good on paper, but the reality is that schools are still struggling to manage, and that can’t be forgotten. The positive cases amongst pupils and staff and the staff shortages are still a daily factor that schools are having to contend with.”First Minister Paul Givan said the Executive decision was always that restrictions wouldn’t stay in place for a day longer than necessary.“The view is that these restrictions relaxed today are no longer necessary,” he said.“Our parents, our teachers and our students want to be in school. They want to be in university. They want face to face contact with their lecturers and teachers. We’re seeking to provide all the support we can to do that in a safe manner.“We have to make sure the environments are as safe as possible but we do need to keep our children in schools.“One thing that those lockdown measures showed us is the harm that they caused to children in particular, and the impact both academically and psychologically, and unfortunately physical abuse as well. That is a measure none of us want to see repeated in the future.“These are testing times for our principals, for our teaching staff. They have been doing a remarkable job with teaching in classes and trying to deliver online learning for those pupils who haven’t been able to be in school. Closing down our schools is not something I ever want to see happen again.”Related topicsDepartment of EducationThe Executive OfficePaul GivanMore On Department of Education PremiumMark BainOpinionLessons to be learned from rare agreement on school starting ageSchool Covid absences not as bad as feared, says Education MinisterBill on flexible school starting age to be fast-tracked through Stormont PremiumMark BainOpinionWhy we should measure the value of a school, not the costFewer pupils absent at start of new school term in NI than before ChristmasMost ReadArlene Foster thought ‘for most of weekend’ about Cavan teen who took his own le after being bullied because dad was ProtestantTributes paid to ‘beautul’ Fionntan McGarveyas PSNI launch murder investigation into fatal assaultNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedNI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen and table service rules scrapped as First Minister says society must get back to ‘normality’Ashling’s family hold pictures of her as man faces murder chargeTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayVideo: Northern Ireland leaders break ground for new Derry hotelLatest EducationMark BainOpinionLessons to be learned from rare agreement on school starting ageSchool Covid absences not as bad as feared, says Education MinisterMen dominate at top of police, politics and the health serviceMark BainOpinionWhy we should measure the value of a school, not the cost schools at risk under plan to streamline education in Northern IrelandLatestWaterfoot beach and caravan park at risk amid erosion and extreme weather damageBelfast movie will be a big draw, say local cinema ownersThe Works enjoys strong Christmas from Peppa Pig and Paw PatrolNathan Blake: There could be a union for black players in bid to tackle racismBiden issues new warning to Russia over invading Ukraine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Danny LawsonNiamh CampbellTwitterEmailJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMany of us have had to get used to sticking swabs up our noses and down our throats.But recently, the Public Health Agencyreleased nasal-only swab tests to help detect Covid-, especially in asymptomatic iniduals.In December, it was announced that post-primary school pupils would only have to swab their nostrils with new ACON Flowflex nose-only tests, which the PHA said would “make regular asymptomatic testing easier”.Traditionally, lateral flow testshave required people to swab both their noses and their throats to testthey have contracted coronavirus.According to Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist from Queen’s University in Belfast, “there remains a good deal of research to be done on figuring out what’s going on with the tests and virus in your nose and throat”.He noted “there’s a chance that swabbing your nose versus your throat could give a dferent result when using rapid Covid antigen tests”.“There are several examples on social media of throat swabs showing positivity while nose swabs being negative despite some tests only recommending nose ,” he continued.“Therefore, there’s a chance that nose only could miss people who are likely to be contagious, which is not a good idea when you’re trying to slow down the spread of an infection.”Matt Wills, programme director of the Rapid Testing Team said: “There are now several dferent types of Lateral Flow Devices in use across Northern Ireland. It’s vital that anyone using them closely follows the instructions in their test kits.“All the tests currently in circulation have been proven to accurately detect the new Omicron iant. Both the ACON and Orient Gene tests are nasal only tests, meaning a throat swab is not required.“The result is ready after  minutes but the result may be inaccurateread after  minutes. There are other dferences too so it’s important to read the instructions as you complete the test.”Dr Bamford said “some tests have been validated for nose and throat while others have been validated for nose only”.“During the latest wave of Omicron, which has been very large and when antigen tests have high availability, we have noticed dferences between where you swab. There remains a good deal of research to be done on figuring out what’s going on with the tests and virus in your nose and throat.”The anti-viral immunity expert also believes that “testing will likely have use outside of the clinic for the near future” and said “the success of testing, tracing and isolating is based on accurately finding those who are most infectious”.He added that “the success of our vaccine rollout — including boosters — is likely the source of why the latest Omicron wave hasn’t been as bad as previous waves with regard to people getting really sick and dying”.“It’s likely that through the continuation of vaccination over the next years, we will maintain solid protection against severe disease for most people and most iants. What Covid has taught us though is to not let get complacent and there’s still signicant uncertainty about what the next wave and or iant will look like,” he said.Matt Wills added: “Please keep making safer choices and follow the latest guidance evenyour test result is negative.”Related topicsQueen’s UniversityMore On Queen’s University PremiumMen dominate at top of police, politics and the health serviceIn-person teaching set toat Queen’s University PremiumLisa SmythOpinionIf Omicron goes, we can be cautiously optimisticWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days  PremiumProfessor Colin Harvey: ‘Destructive negativity’ will not derail united Ireland conversationMost ReadArlene Foster thought ‘for most of weekend’ about Cavan teen who took his own le after being bullied because dad was ProtestantTributes paid to ‘beautul’ Fionntan McGarveyas PSNI launch murder investigation into fatal assaultNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedNI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen and table service rules scrapped as First Minister says society must get back to ‘normality’Ashling’s family hold pictures of her as man faces murder chargeTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayVideo: Northern Ireland leaders break ground for new Derry hotelLatest CoronavirusStronger messaging urged as schools bear the brunt of relaxationsAll Covid- rules may be ended in Northern Ireland in  daysWhat are the rules going to the pub, will you need a Covid passport and when are nightclubs reopening NI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen from Wednesday, table service to be removed and changes to vaccine passport rulesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLatestWaterfoot beach and caravan park at risk amid erosion and extreme weather damageBelfast movie will be a big draw, say local cinema ownersThe Works enjoys strong Christmas from Peppa Pig and Paw PatrolNathan Blake: There could be a union for black players in bid to tackle racismBiden issues new warning to Russia over invading Ukraine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

and the requirement to be seated in hospitality venues, Guidance regarding the number of households meeting indoors was scrapped, The requirement to provide proof of face mask exemption is no longer necessary and guidance on working from home was changed to “working from home where you can”, The self-isolation period was also reduced to five days, depending on negative lateral flow test results, From Wednesday, nightclubs can reopen, and dancing and indoor events can resume, Nightclubs and events with more than  people must continue to check for Covid-status certicates, but it is no longer necessary in pubs and restaurants and Offices no longer need to implement two-metre social distancing.Speaking during Thursday’s announcement, Mr Givan said he was “delighted” at the decisions taken by the Executive.“The February  date will be an important meeting now for those outstanding measures that are still in place,” he added.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said it was a “good day and hopeful day” but urged a note of caution and continued to advise the public to take up the offer of a vaccine.Publicans were thrilled with the easing of the restrictions as the industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic.Belfast publican Pedro Donald, who owns the Sunflower Bar on Union Street and The American Bar at the docks, said it was “absolutely fantastic news”.“The costs have gone up because we’ve needed extra staff to do the door and do the table service, but the income has gone down,” he said. “It’s been a disaster so it is such a relief.”The owner of Belfast city pub Bittles Bar, John Bittles, was relieved to see the end of Covid- certication, as checking everything from mobile apps to PCR test results had proved to be a dficult task.“It’s January, you have bills to pay, you’ve staff to pay so I think the general consensus is we’re really glad to see it but I think for the sake of a week, they should have lted the Covid passport as well,” said Mr Bittles.General manager of Moira’s Pretty Mary’s, Joe Webb, was glad to see theof dancing in venues as it will allow the Co Down pub to bring back its popular live music evenings.“There was no point in having music on unless people could dance,” said Mr Webb. “Its definitely a very welcome step forward for the industry.”Elsewhere, Belfast’s DJ Tez told Evening Extra that the Executive must explain why nightclubs need to continue to ask for Covid- certication.Related topicsThe Executive OfficeDepartment of HealthPaul GivanMichelle O#NeillMore On The Executive Office PremiumStronger

She has also been named Ireland’s fittest woman on numerous occasions.Emma’s performance in August was her best placing at the event, and Wodapalooza will help her continue preparations for the summer’s CrossFit Games as she aims to be crowned the fittest woman on earth.This year’s Wodapalooza was held at Bayfront Park in Miami.

It’s more just the reward of winning the competition over winning the money,” added Emma. “The money is just a bonus. The sacrice and hard work of training is the thing I’m most proud of.“I’m just focusing on soaking up as much possible right now and then it’s head down for the start of the CrossFit Games  season.”Australia’s Tia-Clair Toomey was named the fittest woman on Earth for the fth consecutive year at last year’s games.At the time, Emma said her th place finish was “unbelievable”, but she is hoping that her Wodapalooza success will set her up for the challenging year ahead.“It’s a great confidence boost to see where you’re at at the start of the year, knowing that you’ve got another six or seven months of hard training to get better,” she said. “It was nice to build back to a good level of fitness and it’s nice to finish this competition healthy and just build into it.”The  CrossFit Games finals will be held in Madison, Wisconsin, in August.Most ReadArlene Foster thought ‘for most of weekend’ about Cavan teen who took his own le after being bullied because dad was ProtestantTributes paid to ‘beautul’ Fionntan McGarveyas PSNI launch murder investigation into fatal assaultNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedNI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen and table service rules scrapped as First Minister says society must get back to ‘normality’Ashling’s family hold pictures of her as man faces murder chargeTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayVideo: Northern Ireland leaders break ground for new Derry hotelLatest Northern IrelandStronger messaging urged as schools bear the brunt of relaxationsAndy McBrine lands top  ODI world ranking after heroics during Ireland#s victory over West IndiesMick McDermott: Any fair play laws in Irish League must not halt our clubs’ progressPeer suggests having two first ministers at Stormont and no deputyMan questioned over fatal assault on Belfast teenager releasedLatestBiden issues new warning to Russia over invading UkraineSinger Meat Loaf dies aged MC Saatchi confirms accounting scandal probe endsHospital uses AI to treat cervical cancer patient in UK firstMore than half of Scots think partygate saga has hurt case for Union – poll,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

one of her most popular dresses for hire at her Newry shop Willow Designer Dress HireAmy CochraneTwitterEmailJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailHow many times have you bought an outfit, worn it once, posted it on social media then hid it away in the recesses of your wardrobe only to gather dust and never to see the light of day again More times than enough is the answer for many people as the wave of fast fashion continues to affect both the environment and our finances.It is estimated that the fashion industry accounts for up to % of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.There is, however, a solution which has grown in popularity as the concept of sustainable fashion gains traction - renting dresses for a special occasion.Willow Designer Dress Hire in Newry was established in August  by Cara Heaney, who wanted to help people to refocus their views on buying clothes and help them to make more environmentally-conscious choices, while also looking great in some top designer outfits.The idea for the business came after a wardrobe clear-out shocked her into realising just how many clothes she had worn only once.“I had paid a lot of money for these, but some were long out of date and I just wouldn’t feel comfortable wearing them again, so into the charity bag they went,” said Cara.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “This got me thinking that I probably wasn’t the only one with lots of wardrobe space taken up by dresses worn once and I dreaded to think of the amount of money spent on these.“It really was such a waste,” she said.“To be honest I had never thought of hiring dresses before, but something just clicked that it would be a great service to offer.”While Cara said that this is not a new idea, she felt that it was the perfect time to bring this issue of wasted clothing back into the public eye.“The more I researched this, I discovered that there was a gap in the local market for this service but not only for just ordinary dresses, what about really nice high-end labels – the kind you see on the more popular social media influencers,” she said.“When it comes to fashion, the most obvious is to hire occasion-wear which you are only going to wear once or twice maximum.“You would still get that great feeling of wearing a fabulous dress and not being out the money.”Some of the dresses worn by social media influencers, and some which Cara offers to rent, can set you back over £ a piece, but you can rent them on average for about £ for a maximum of four days.Labels stocked at Willow include Self-Portrait, Zimmerman, Nadine Merabi and Rixo as well as Kevan Jon and Nadine Merabi.“Of course, the number one reason why anyone would hire clothes is for financial reasons,” said the Co Down businesswoman.“The price tag on the high end labels that most people aspire to wear is just too hefty for most, howeveryou were to rent that little black dress for your special occasion, you can have access to your favourite designer without racking up the credit card debt.”She said that not only does the idea of hiring clothes make sense financially, but it is also environmentally friendly.“It is an unbelievable fact that with UK households sending , tonnes of fashion waste to landfill every year and the average number of times a garment is worn is dropping by % over the last  years,” she said.Social media, however, she argues, seems to play a part in the continued use of fast fashion labels and the splurging on expensive outfits only to be worn once.“At occasions when people are glammed up, photos are taken, posted on social media and you are put off from wearing it again,” said Cara.“You aren’t going to have the same dress appear three or four times on your page. “With the rise of cheap clothing the impact on the environment is huge as well,” she added.“People generally don’t feel guilty about throwing out a £ vest top out of Primark, whereasthey had an £ top, they would think twice about putting it in the bin!”Cara has hired dresses out to women all over Ireland, from Dublin, Donegal and Galway and even one from Liverpool who was visiting Belfast for the weekend.You can follow the business on Instagram by searching for @willow_designer_dress_hire.Most ReadArlene Foster

Credit: Ariadna De Raadt FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMost signicant is the absence of a woman minister on this year’s list. Credit: Ariadna De RaadtJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA seasoned observer of Presbyterian Moderatoral elections will notice several important points about this year’s list.All four candidates are ministers in rural areas - from Portrush, Larne, Kilrea and Richhill. Usually there is at least one from the greater Belfast area or the main centres of population.Read MoreNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedSecondly there are no candidates from across the Border, even though every Moderator represents the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.There are lively Presbyteries in the Republic who might be expected to put forward a candidate, but their reluctance to do so may be because the current Moderator, the Rt Revd Dr Bruce, has spent a large part of his career ministering across the border.It is also interesting that only four ministers allowed their names to go forward this year, though there were greater numbers in some years past. This may be a coincidence, or it may be because fewer ministers want to shoulder the challenges of a high public profile which every Moderator faces, and particularly in these years when the PCI is involved in continued controversy about its policy on same-sex issues.Most signicant is the absence of a woman minister on this year’s list. The PCI has been constantly criticised for its failure to elect a female Moderator.Ironically it was the first main Reformed Church in Ireland to ordain a woman minister – the Reverend Ruth Patterson. Since then she stood twice, unsuccessfully, for the Moderatorship and on her second attempt she received not a single vote from any of the  Presbyteries.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up More recently the Reverend Dr Elizabeth Hughes, formerly of Whitehouse Presbyterian, was runner-up in the election for Moderator but when she ran again the next year she was down the list.Perhaps women ministers are longer willing to put themselves forward with seemingly so little chance of success.Whatever the reason, it is extraordinary that in this age of gender equality, the PCI is still unable or unwilling to elect a female leader. Sadly, it remains the only major Reformed church in Ireland not to do so.Most ReadArlene Foster thought ‘for most of weekend’ about Cavan teen who took his own le after being bullied because dad was ProtestantTributes paid to ‘beautul’ Fionntan McGarveyas PSNI launch murder investigation into fatal assaultNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedNI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen and table service rules scrapped as First Minister says society must get back to ‘normality’Ashling’s family hold pictures of her as man faces murder chargeTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayVideo: Northern Ireland leaders break ground for new Derry hotelLatest Northern IrelandStronger messaging urged as schools bear the brunt of relaxationsAndy McBrine lands top  ODI world ranking after heroics during Ireland#s victory over West IndiesMick McDermott: Any fair play laws in Irish League must not halt our clubs’ progressPeer suggests having two first ministers at Stormont and no deputyMan questioned over fatal assault on Belfast teenager releasedLatestBiden issues new warning to Russia over invading UkraineSinger Meat Loaf dies aged MC Saatchi confirms accounting scandal probe endsHospital uses AI to treat cervical cancer patient in UK firstMore than half of Scots think partygate saga has hurt case for Union – poll,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is deeply disappointing and a missed opportunity to demonstrate a broad consensus on this important issue. It is particularly disappointing that both of Sinn Féin’s South Down MLAs were absent for the vote.Sinn Féin  said: “Sinéad Ennis had to leave for urgent family business the chair was informed in advance. The amendment is being tabled as a cross party amendment by Sinn Féin, SDLP and Green Party.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Most ReadArlene Foster thought ‘for most of weekend’ about Cavan teen who took his own le after being bullied because dad was ProtestantTributes paid to ‘beautul’ Fionntan McGarveyas PSNI launch murder investigation into fatal assaultNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedNI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen and table service rules scrapped as First Minister says society must get back to ‘normality’Ashling’s family hold pictures of her as man faces murder chargeTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayVideo: Northern Ireland leaders break ground for new Derry hotelLatest Northern IrelandWaterfoot beach and caravan park at risk amid erosion and extreme weather damageBelfast movie will be a big draw, say local cinema ownersStronger messaging urged as schools bear the brunt of relaxationsAndy McBrine lands top  ODI world ranking after heroics during Ireland#s victory over West IndiesMick McDermott: Any fair play laws in Irish League must not halt our clubs’ progressLatestWaterfoot beach and caravan park at risk amid erosion and extreme weather damageBelfast movie will be a big draw, say local cinema ownersThe Works enjoys strong Christmas from Peppa Pig and Paw PatrolNathan Blake: There could be a union for black players in bid to tackle racismBiden issues new warning to Russia over invading Ukraine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that

extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they

Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

The only good news is that we will not be closing and are hoping that a leaner and fitter plant can be a springboard for the future, said Mr OrsquoNeill.DRUMANESS ndash Around forty villagers from Drumaness rolled up their sleeves on Sunday to give the local mill pond a much-needed clean-up.The Friends of Drumaness Dam group pulled a large quantity of rubbish out of the pond in the first of a series of work days aimed at improving the area.Fallen branches which had been washed into the dam were removed with the aid of ropes, while rubbish dumped in the centre of the pond was removed by boat. The branches were burnt on a bonfire, and all plastic collected was taken to Drumnakelly dump for safe disposal.Among the workers who took part in the work day was Mrs Sheila Lewis-Crosby, who along with her husband John is the owner of the mill pond. She and Drumaness woman Mrs Carmel Mason cleared brambles constructing a path alongside the dam.After the clean-up, the secretary of the Friends of Drumaness, Dam Lisa Fagan, congratulated the volunteers and thanked local councillor Patsy Toman for initiating the venture.ldquoThe Drumaness people can be proud of our achievement here today, she said. ldquoThere is no doubt that the whole community is sickened by these incidents, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash People who take part in the after-dark practice of ldquolamping rabbits have this week been warned they are placing themselves in danger.The RUC has warned that people who dress up in combat clothing and walk around fields hunting rabbits with firearms could find themselves being confronted by a security force patrol.Over the Christmas and New Year period, the RUC received reports of ldquolamping in the Downpatrick and Crossgar areas and it also believed to have occurred around Saintfield.The practice has been a problem in the Castlewellan area for a number of years but it is relatively unknown in east Down.It involves hunters going into fields without farmersrsquo permission and shooting rabbits by torchlight. Rabbits instinctively freeze when caught in a beam of light making them sitting targets for anyone with a shotgun.However, the sudden spread of the problem has alarmed the RUC which is appealing for people not to take part in what is regarded as a ldquohighly dangerous occupation.COMBER ndash Plans for the second stage of the Comber by-pass have been postponed for four years, it has been revealed.Strangford Ulster Unionist MP, Mr John Taylor, said he has been informed of the decision which he says has left him ldquoshell-shocked.ldquoTogether with local councillors and Comber businessmen I have been campaigning for many years to get the by-pass built. It is incredible that the Conservative Party is so mishandling the local economy that a scheme of such major importance to Comber and the outlying areas can be postponed to a date four years from now, Mr Taylor said this week.ldquoThe Minister met myself and a delegation of Ards Borough councillors last year and he agreed that Comber by-pass was a priority scheme Now he has shelved it for four years.ldquoI can understand slippage of a few months due to existing schemes costing more than has already been planned but a four year delay is out of the question.Mr Taylor said he has spoken to local members of his partyrsquos Comber branch and they are ldquohorried at the decision.BISHOPSCOURT ndash A total of around  local residents have signed a petition opposing proposals to turn the former Bishopscourt airfield into a motor-race track.The petition organisers say they are delighted by the response which indicates a ldquothumbs-down by the majority of people living in the area.ldquoThe residents all live in the immediate vicinity of the airfield or along the Downpatrick to Ballyhornan road, and so are the people most likely to be affectedthe planned track were to go ahead, explained a spokesman this week.The residents say they are concerned at proposals, currently with the Planning Service in Downpatrick, to turn part of the former air base at Ballyhornan into a race track.A spokesman said the petition is to be sent to the planning authorities and to the Minister for the Environment, Mr Richard Needham, this week. They are also to seek a meeting with planners to outline their case.SAINTFIELD ndash Damage to Saintfieldrsquos century-old floral farm cart at the weekend has infuriated village residents and especially the members of the pioneering Bloom committee.The celebrated cart, laden with polyanthus, pansies and spring flowers, had its shafts broken at the body when it was lted from its perch and ped to the ground before midnight on Saturday.In December it was removed to the side of the Orange Hall and behind locked gates to make space for the Christmas tree.

The competitiveness of the derby resulted in a stalemate by half-time.With chances coming early on into the third quarter, short corners naturally started to follow. lsquoHinch were able to work the ball up through Adam Dodds before passing over to Jason Campbell, who was able to win a short corner for his side.Matthew Martin released his drag flick going just wide of the post.Saintfield were able to keep lsquoHinch at bay until a cross ball from Martin found team-mate Andrew McIlwaine at the back post to opening the scoring.With lsquoHinch looking to keep their lead, they engaged a high press on to the Saintfield defence as they hoped to increase their lead.However, with this high press tactic Saintfield were able to break away past the lsquoHinch defence only to be met at the top of the circle by lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell, who did well to prevent a goal.A super ball from Leslie Harrison to forward Lewis Higginson, allowed the lsquoHinch attacker to run the baseline and win a short corner.Martin took a drag flick only to be stopped by the Saintfield lsquokeeper.Saintfield responded by pushing lsquoHinch into their own circle and winning a short corner.The Saints managed to convert off the short corner to equalise the game in the final quarter.Despite a few more half chances, both sides went home with a share of the spoils..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Magnificent Kilcoo are champs of Ulster again  ","story":"KILCOO are one game away from a place in this yearrsquos All-Ireland Club Championship final.Last Sunday, the Magpies produced a spectacular performance to dismantle Fermanagh champions Derrygonnelly at the Athletic Grounds in a one-sided affair to win by  points.Mickey Moranrsquos men are now red-hot favourites to win the All-Ireland club final after losing out to Galway champions Corofin after extra-time in .But Kilcoo must first overcome St Finbarrrsquos in the semi-final clash at pm on Saturday, January  at OrsquoMoore Park, Portlaoise and will be taking nothing for granted.Last Sunday, goals from Daryl Branagan, Ceilum Doherty and Shealan Johnston contributed to the onslaught in Armagh to secure the Ulster title by a comfortable margin.Paul Devlin enjoyed his afternoon splitting the sticks, with reassurance within the squad stemming all theway from the back through Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, who bossed hisarea and even registered a point of his own.With the pain of the  All-Ireland defeat still hurting, Kilcoo will be looking to right that wrong and taste success.ldquoThe Corofin game really hurt, said Kilcoo star Ryan McEvoy.ldquoAfter playing so well for so long and then just not getting over the line, it hurt.

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations. Without this funding, the buildings will continue their slow decline and will eventually collapse.Meanwhile, the man who is supporting the community park proposal visited Saintfield recently.Mr Moffett has already made a substantial donation to the association to enable it to purchase the Windmill Field.During his visit, Mr Moffett had an opportunity to walk around the field and visualise how the proposed community park would surround the ancient windmill and caretakerrsquos home that is part of Saintfieldrsquos history. He also met a number of residents at the community centre before visiting Rowallane Garden for a guided tour.Mr Moffett concluded the first day of his visit with a visit to the Belfast Road community centre to view the new facility and was impressed at the potential of fitting out the remaining empty buildings which would include a heritage area to complement the planned windmill park.Mr Moffett, who also played a round of golf at Royal County Down and visited the Mournes, said the beauty of Co Down, with its unique visitor sites and the central location of Saintfield, reinforced in his mind the importance of the windmill park project and the heritage centre.The third and final day of his visit was spent at a local shop exploring the location of his familyrsquos th century farm in Leggygowan.Mr Moffett said: ldquoExploring my family history was a wonderful way to end my visit to Saintfield.

It was revealed last May that one driver was clocked travelling at an incredible mph in the mph zone in Saintfield at am.Figures released by the PCSP over the past year have revealed that speeding in built-up areas across the district continues to be a major problem.In addition to the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield, other speeding hot spots include the Strangford Road in Downpatrick and South Promenade in Newcastle.The Dundrum Road in Clough is a new entry on the list following the installation of an electronic speeding device on the approach to the village, while the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass is another new entry on the speeding hot-spot list.The highest speed recorded in the mph zone in Clough was mph at am, with the highest speed at the Strangford Road mdash where a mph limit is in place mdash was mph. This offence was detected around am.Since the speeds recorded by the electronic devices have been made public, politicians have expressed their shock at the behaviour of those who continue to break the law and have appealed to them to slow down.Erected as part of a major offensive on speeding drivers at a number of well known speeding hot spots, the speed indicator devices are being hailed a success as speeds in most areas where they are located are reducing.However, concern remains about the behaviour of some drivers continuing to show a blatant disregard for mph and mph speed limits in place.Recent figures published by the PCSP revealed that the highest number of speeders in Castlewellan and Killyleagh were detected around am and pm respectively, with those who hit high speeds in Ardglass detected at pm.While Clough recorded the highest speed, a detailed examination of the figures reveals that five drivers went through the mph in the village at mph, with % of all drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit.In Downpatrick,  drivers were detected at over mph in the mph zone, with one driver clocked at mph in the mph zone at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan. The highest speed recorded at the mph zone at the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass was mph.Policing and Community Safety Partnership officials say that figures recorded across the districtrsquos speed indicator signs for the most recent three-month period shows an overall speed reduction of around six percent.The number of drivers clocked at over mph across the  speed indicator signs spread across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area was almost , while the average number of speeding violations over mph was %.

It has been highly infectious but has had minor health impacts.This is a time to celebrate the success of the vaccine programme, above all in the United Kingdom — a country of which we are lucky to be a part given that is a global scientic leader and played a key role in developing the medications.It is also a time to recognise the way in which the great bulk of people have, cheerfully enough, adapted to the new considerate ways of living in a pandemic.This experience will almost certainly help us to respond much more quickly to any future viral outbreak. Many people, for example, will want to continue to wear masks even when they cease to be mandatory.It might yet be that there is fresh, more dangerous outbreak of Covid. But we can no longer put le on hold due to that possibility.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolsand the wider Catholic school community are extremely concerned at the choice of words used by UUP leader Doug Beattie MLA when he declared the “need to end educational apartheid”.[In a press release last Friday he had declared: “We need to end educational apartheid which is taking place here. We need a single education system in Northern Ireland that allows them to do that.”]Catholic schools and many others across the education sector firmly reject the use of this inflammatory language as they work tirelessly to promote a shared educational landscape.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The one-dimensional and isive ‘segregated VS integrated’ dichotomy suggests that there is only one way forward, namely making all schools ‘integrated’.There is in fact a wide spectrum of approaches to break down barriers, end ision and promote a unied, strong society. Catholic schools and others continue to work together to realise this ideal.I would welcome the opportunity to share with Mr Beattie the context of Catholic schools in Northern Ireland, their vision and purpose and the important role that Catholic schools exercise in educating and enriching the lives of everyone in their host communities.Equally, I would encourage Mr Beattie to discuss with both myself and colleagues across the education sector the positive changes that many governors, principals, staff, children, and young people have cultivated in their communities through shared education programmes and partnerships across Northern Ireland.Catholic schools firmly believe that no child should be left behind.Our vision is to enable all young people to meet their full potential, through access to a high-quality education irrespective of location, socio-economic background, ability, or gender.Catholic schools wish to cultivate an education system which guarantees all children will be equally supported to fulfil their potential.The challenge for all of us is to build a fair and respectful society. Education and all of our schools have a very important role to play in progressing this vision – maintained, controlled, integrated, Irish medium and grammar.However, this can only workwe all continue to work together and in this regard the label of educational apartheid is extremely unhelpful.– Gerry Campbell is Chief Executive of CCMSMore from the News Letter: Click here: Higgins in spotlight over political neutrality ahead of major Bloody Sunday event following ‘sectarian NI state’ comments from organisers Click here: VIDEO: Move to rename Prince Andrew Way – one of four such roads in Northern Ireland – as mother shreds his royal status Click here: VIDEO: The most stunning photos of Northern Ireland from the air – as taken by the PSNI helicopter squad over the last year Click here: WATCH: Odd speech by chief NI Protocol negotiator Liz Truss shows her enraged by imported cheese but overjoyed at pork marketsA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Credit : Rob Youngson   Focus FeaturesThe film starts with the jollity of a tight-knit terraced neighbourhood being shattered by a riot intended to intimidate Catholics into moving out.Given the starting point, the threat of violence looms large for the entire film but it is not a well which Branagh taps too often. Instead he celebrates togetherness rather than ision, helped by a stand-out cast including Ciaran Hinds, Judi Dench, Caitriona Balfe and Jamie Dornan.There are bits of dialogue reminiscent of the Derry Girls scene listing the dferences between the two religions that bring a chuckle.For example when Buddy, who doesn’t want to go to church, points out: “But Daddywe were Catholics we could not go to church, then every once in a wee while we could do it and confess. And then they’d have to tell us we were forgiven and we wouldn’t have to go in again for ages.”The film does have a certain feel-good factor which belies its backdrop. Ultimately, it could mean that Branagh’s heartwarming story, aided by an uplting soundtrack from Belfast’s own Van Morrison, is better received internationally rather than locally, where we’ve grown accustomed to expecting the worst to happen.Whether you’re watching the film in Belfast, Beirut or Boston it is hard to find fault in the film’s visual integrity – its wonderful black and white imagery is captivating on the silver screen.The often dark Northern Irish sense of humour is also given a good showcase, like when Buddy is trying to solve a mathematical problem with his granddad who tells him to make his numbers indistinct so his teacher will give him the benefit of the doubt.“But there’s only one right answer,” says Buddy.His Pop replies: “If that were true, son, people wouldn’t be blowing themselves up all across town.”• Belfast opens in the UK on Friday, January , though some special screenings of the film are taking place in Belfast this evening ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It’s proportionate, it reflects the changing circumstances that we have in respect of Covid, and it is a step in the right direction, and hopefully we will continue to make progress at our meeting on February .”Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said that while the pandemic was not over, she believed Northern Ireland had passed the peak of omicron.She said: “The pandemic is far from over but we are cautiously optimistic. We believe we are through the peak and we believe we have some space now to be able to reverse the protections that we put in place over the course of the last number of weeks.“It is a positive picture but I would ask people not to be complacent yet.“I do think after our Executive meeting we hope we will be able to say positive things that will be welcomed by both iniduals and also by the hospitality sector.”The deaths of a further two people who had previously tested positive for Covid- were notied by the Department of Health yesterday.The latest update from the Department shows that a total of , coronavirus fatalities have now been recorded.The figures also show , new infections, with  Covid-positive patients in hospital, and  in intensive care.l Morning View, page "},{"url":null,"title":"watch citys oldest picture house the perfect spot to watch kenneth branaghs belfast film ","story":"Perpetrators of Troubles bloodshed are not the ones who matter: their victims are   PSNI reveals why Paramilitary Crime Task Force investigates UVF, UDA and INLA - but not the IRANewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleWATCH: City’s oldest picture house the perfect spot to watch Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast filmWhen Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast opens tomorrowin the city where it is set, one cinema can lay claim to being a venue befitting of hosting the movie.By Graeme CousinsWednesday, th January , : pmUpdated Thursday, th January , : am  \"       \"  The Strand Cinema on the Holywood Road in east Belfast first opened in  and is the only ‘picture house’ still standing from the time when Belfast is set – the s.Strand Arts Centre CEO Mimi Turtle said: “This is the only original picture house left in Belfast. “The film itself includes a couple of visits to the pictures.

All Rights Reserved. WARNING: This picture must only be used to accompany PA Feature SHOWBIZ Film Reviews.“The Strand has a lot of similarities to the Troxy, the same architect. It feels quite nostalgic watching it in a picture house whenever you’re looking at another cinema from the same era.”Although the film’s UK release date is given as Friday , special screenings will take place in Belfast tomorrow evening before opening across Northern Ireland on Friday. Mimi said the film had generated a lot of interest prior to its release: “We’ve seen a lot more interest than we normally would.“People are really interested and intrigued, I think people hold Kenneth Branagh in such a sense of pride. He has given back an enormous amount to our creative industry in Northern Ireland, championing what he considers his home town.Strand Arts Centre CEO Mimi Turtle looks ahead to the UK cinema release of Sir Kenneth Branaghs Belfast film“The audience are interested, particularly those middle-aged and senior, who will remember the era.”Jude Hill plays nine-year-old Buddy, a role based on Branagh himself, in the film which also stars Jamie Dornan, Ciaran Hinds, Caitriona Balfe and Judi Dench as members of Buddy’s family.It is set at the beginning of the Troubles, but violence, although occasional, is not to the fore in the film.Mimi said: “I think the Troubles is more of a backdrop. It’s incidental to the characters.“There’s definitely a sense that it’s written for a global audience more than a Northern Ireland audience.“It’s got that nostalgia, that wholesomeness which the American love about all things Northern Irish or Irish.”She added: “This is just one person’s story, one person’s memory and obviously stories and narratives change with memory.“It’s that kind of sepia, rose-tinted view that comes whenever you have memories.“Because it is set here I know Kenneth Branagh and Jamie Dornan have said in interviews that they are more nervous that people here will enjoy it and accept it.”Of the staggered release which has seen the film open in America and other parts of the world before the UK, Mimi said: “It is unusual because of pirating for a film not to have one international release date.“People here will already have seen the film, but not on the big screen as it was meant to be showcased.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

If regulators decide that Tinder’s personalised pricing is breaking the law, then the dating app giant must face strong action.”Tinder respond to discrimination claimsTinder told Which  that it was “categorically untrue that our pricing structure discriminates in any way by sexual preference”.A Tinder spokeswoman told Which : “Tinder is free to use and the vast majority of our members enjoy our app without upgrading to the paid experience.“However, we do offer a iety of subscription options to help our members stand out and match with new people more efficiently..remove“Tinder operates a global business and, in some geographies, we offer discounted subscriptions to younger members.“In addition, we frequently offer promotional rates which can y based on factors like location orof subscription.

explore the possibility of letting local authors sell their books in council properties.By Adam Morton, Local Democracy ReporterThursday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  The issue was raised during a discussion of the council’s decision to purchase Seamus Heaney poetry books for resale at a meeting of its development committee.A report on the matter notes that poetry books are a very popular purchase for visitors to Seamus Heaney HomePlace and explains a  per cent discount has been negotiated with the wholesale company Grantham Book Services for purchase of the books from January  – December .Proposing the recommendation to approve this direct award contract, UUP Councillor Trevor Wilson asked how others might sell their goods at the Seamus Heaney HomePlace and other council venues.Seamus Heaney HomePlace, Bellaghy Picture: GoogleHis party’s group leader, Councillor Walter Cuddy said it was important local people are supported in their endeavoursby their local authority.“I’m a retailer and I would get local people coming in looking to sell their own books and I’m wonderingthey can go to the likes of the Seamus Heaney HomePlace or the other buildings we have and seethey could be sold there,” asked Cllr Cuddy.“It is important local people get an opportunity from their council. These topics could be important locally. Is it possible they could be allowed to avail of having some sort of agreement and arrangement to sell their books in council properties ”Seconding the initialproposal by Cllr Wilson, Councillor Frances Burton also said she would support Cllr Cuddy’s idea and described it as a “really good initiative”.“I would support what Walter is putting forward there,” said Cllr Burton.“It is a really good initiative. Local people have an interest in their own area and it is a really good way of promoting the local as well.”Council’s head of arts and cultural services, Tony McCance told members he was confident a suitable arrangement could be found as it is already done in Ranfurly House and the Burnavon Centre.Read More Read MoreUnionists objections on Mid Ulster Council over £, Irish unity groupMid Ulster District CouncilSeamus Heaney  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularPortadown girl Suzanne De Groot was full of le, a talented...NewsCovid- restrictions to relax in NI: what are the changes ...NewsLarne motorist crashed into rear of parked car...NewsTyrone market trader still going strong...News who was in in possession of heroin receives suspended jail sentence\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime man--who-was-in-in-possession-of-heroin-receives-suspended-jail-sentence- itm_sourceparsely-api\" who was in in possession of heroin receives suspended jail sentence\" \"\" width\"\" who was in in possession of heroin receives suspended jail sentence\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime man--who-was-in-in-possession-of-heroin-receives-suspended-jail-sentence- itm_sourceparsely-api\"Manwho was in in possession of heroin receives suspend...NewsMost PopularHome exercise gear that works: weighted hula-hoops, bala ban...RecommendedSofas UK: best sofas and couches to furnish your home, whate...RecommendedHome office desks UK: make smart use of the space you have w...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?164206751200","title":"take part in this year s big garden birdwatch ","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.
