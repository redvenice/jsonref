She was made to start wearing a hijab at seven years old. Masih is pictured smiling with her brother in a new skirt made by her mother, the tailor for the village‘In 2014, before my campaign was launched, police announced 3.6 million women were sent to court for “inappropriate hijab”... 40,000 cars were impounded for inappropriate hijab,’ Masih states. Inappropriate hijab can be a headscarf that does not fully cover a woman’s hair or a hijab deemed to be the wrong colour.Every day, she receives dozens of images and videos from women inside Iran who are resisting the veil, which she shares on her Instagram and My Stealthy Freedom Facebook page. And weekly, on a day she has coined \u0027White Wednesdays\u0027, Iranian men and women wear the colour white to support her campaign.  ‘It started off with women sending photos of the back of their unveiled heads, then standing in hills and nature, then walking in public and then with their headscarf being waved on a stick,’ she says, explaining how women have grown bolder in their approach.To understand Masih’s bravery, it pays to look at her background. She was born in a tiny village of just 650 people, called Ghomikola, in Mazandaran, northern Iran, to deeply conservative and religious parents. In her new book, The Wind In My Hair, she describes how money was always tight and her freedom was always restricted.Masih wanted to climb trees and ride bikes like her older brother, Ali, but she was born in 1976, just two years before the Islamic Revolution overthrew 2,500 years of continuous Persian monarchy and stripped women of their freedom.One of the first laws imposed by the new Islamic regime, was the introduction of compulsory hijab in 1983, meaning women must always wear a veil over their hair when they’re in public.           Masih grew up in a religious family in a tiny village in northern Iran. She is pictured here with her grandmother, mother, sister, brother Ali. Masih is seen aged six in a headscarf (far right)Forty years later, Masih is helping women in Iran to ‘take their bodies back’ after they were ‘held hostage by the Islamic Republic of Iran’. She has recruited an army of millions of social media followers to help fight her battle. Masih was jailed at the age of 19. Not because she was unveiled but because she ‘became involved with student activists... we were all teenagers’.It was in a tiny cell, after hours of interrogation, that she found out she was pregnant. Her fiancé, Reza, was also in jail having been arrested first. He had noticed Masih’s periods had stopped and told the guards she was pregnant in the hope it would aid her release.‘We hadn’t had our official wedding party. Getting pregnant before getting married is not acceptable back then, 20 years ago, it was a scandal in my village,’ Masih says.          Masih found out she was pregnant at 19 while locked up in a jail cell. Later, her husband orced her and she lost custody to her son Pouyan. They are pictured here together trying on hats on one of his weekend visits to her house Sex education was non-existent in Iran. Even now, young people are forced to educate themselves about sex via social media. ‘I didn’t know that because my period had stopped it was a sign of getting pregnant…. An interrogator gave me a basket of apples and told me. I was shocked.’Masih was eventually sentenced to five years in prison and 74 lashes. Her sentence was suspended for three years, and Masih went on to marry Reza and give birth to her son Pouyan. But instead of going on to live the traditional, reserved family life the judge had hoped for, Masih’s life was thrown into turmoil when Reza decided to orce her. Iranian law meant it was his choice and he was also award custody of Pouyan, aged four.Masih’s father was ashamed of the orce and wanted her to move home to wait for another husband to come along. Instead, Masih began a career that has taken her from being a fledgling photographer to a parliamentary reporter, broadcaster and now internationally recognised women’s rights activist.Her anti-compulsory hijab campaign began in 2014 when - having received threats to her life and fearing another arrest due to her journalistic work - Masih, aged 33, moved to the UK to study at Oxford Brookes University.  Masih worked as a political reporter in Tehran but was banned from Parliament in 2005. She is pictured on her last day in the Majlis (left), facing MPs angry with her exposes of their corrupt practices          Masih can no longer visit her beloved parents, Zarrin Khanom and Aghajan, in Iran for fear of arrest upon her return. She says her conservative father, who supported the Islamic Revolution, \u0027has been brainwashed several times by the intelligence services\u0027  In her home, near Kew Gardens, she stepped out unveiled into a street lined with cherry blossom. Her partner, Kambiz, took a photo and Masih shared it on her Facebook page. The image, along with her message about how the same act would be illegal in Iran, went viral and began her My Stealthy Freedom Campaign.The cause has grown and grown. One video, shared this week on Masih’s Instagram page, has already had over five million views at the time of writing. It shows men and women in the popular tourist city of Isfahan standing up against the morality police who are trying to arrest a young woman because they believed her hijab is inappropriate.The caption reads: ‘The girl stood up to film them and police took her mobile away. But people supported her by chanting. “Give her mobile back, Leave her alone.” In the end, the police ran away.’Scenes like this are taking place across the country thanks to Masih’s campaign.Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was arrested in February after waving her headscarf from a stick while standing on a traffic island in Tehran (pictured). Masih was relieved when, one week later, Shaparak, who is a mother to a nine-year-old son, told her she would not stop protesting forced hijab          Shima Babaei was one of the first White Wednesday campaigners who answered Masih\u0027s call.  ‘Police used violence against her and her father. I felt so bad… but she sent me a video to share via another person saying “you can’t silence me”,’ Masih says‘The new generation of Iranian women will never ask the government for their rights they just take them. Women are told they can’t sing, but women are singing in Iran. They are told they can’t dance, but they are dancing. They are told they can’t show their, hair but they are doing it... this generation went beyond begging for their rights,’ Masih says.She makes clear she is not against people who want to wear the hijab, she is simply against the law that gives women no choice. ‘Iran should be for both sides, people that love hijab like my mum and sister and people that hate it like me,’ she laughs.                            Women are told they can’t sing, but women are singing in Iran. They are told they can’t dance, but they are dancing. They are told they can’t show their, hair but they are doing it.                         Some critics question whether Masih is putting women in danger from authorities by sharing their images on social media.It’s a question she once grappled with herself. ‘Because of my ‘White Wednesday’ campaign, the authorities announced they arrested 29 women... I was crying loudly in my house in New York and felt guilty,’ she says before explaining how messages from campaigners soon reassured her she was doing the right thing.‘When people tell me I’m putting women in danger it’s nonsense because the Islamic Republic has put women in danger for 40 years,’ she says. ‘They are tired of being humiliated and living in fear.’One brave campaigner, Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was arrested in February after waving her headscarf from a stick while standing on a traffic island in Tehran. Masih was relieved when, one week later, Shaparak, who is a mother to a nine-year-old son, told her she would not stop protesting forced hijab. ‘She told me “every Wednesday I feel useful”... she sent me a photo of herself unveiled in front of the prison after her release.’  ‘These are the Rosa Parks of Iran. They want to be heard. I am here outside of Iran and can help…. Shima was told “your crime is working for Masih” but she told the interrogator “Masih is working for me”.’           When this photo of Masih was taken, next to the stream in her village, she didn\u0027t know it would be the last time she would visit her home           Masih is pictured here with her second husband Kambiz Foroohar, who she now lives with in New York. An Iranian hard-line conservative website posted this picture of them online and labeled her a prostitute for appearing without a hijab Masih recounts a story of the time she went to the seaside fully clothed ‘not even in a burkini, proper clothes’. She went into the sea and was arrested simply for getting wet. ‘We were interrogated for a few hours about why we did it,’ she says incredulously. Police accused her of wanting to get men excited.‘Every day you come out of school and they treat you like a criminal,’ she adds.Fighting against the almighty Iranian regime, without weapons, may seem like an impossible struggle. But Masih, an eternal optimist, believes the battle is already won.‘The government has guns and bullets, state TV and the media. Our people only have their mobile phones but we won the battle. People are breaking through the censorship through social media. You can now see the true face of Iran. No one can ignore us anymore… they can’t say hijab is our culture anymore.’Masih believes there is a fear in the West about standing up against compulsory headscarf laws for fear of being deemed ‘Islamophobic’.‘What makes you Islamophobic is keeping silent about injustices like Sharia law, when you see women suffer and you keep silent that is causing Islamophobia.’           Masih has not seen her son Pouyan (pictured together) for more than a year due to Trump\u0027s travel ban, which has stopped Iranians from travelling to the U.S. At school in Iran, boys are forced to cut their hair to a minimum but when Pouyan moved to Oxford he let his curls grow like his mother          In 2016, the Iranian government allocated $1.7 billion for the protection of hijab - compared to $49 million for the protection of the environment. Masih now lives an unveiled life in New York while fighting for the rights of millions of women back home to choose how to dress Masih now lives with her second husband Kambiz in Brooklyn but she does not have a British, American or Iranian passport. Thanks to President Trump’s travel ban, this means she has not seen her 21-year-old son Pouyan - who is studying in England - for more than a year.‘The travel ban hurts ordinary people like me. It affects students, tourists, and human rights activists,’ she says.Masih is a woman who has endured a lot of pain in her life but it is only when talking about how much she misses Iran that she sounds tearful.‘If I had the chance to be in my own country and have the same voice as I have in America, I would definitely go back because I miss my country…‘But I was disrespected since the age of seven, expelled, jailed and never had the chance to be my true self there. Now I’ve seen my book published, I feel bad when I say Americas is not my home because I am respected here.’The Wind in My Hair: My Fight for Freedom in Modern Iran by Masih Alinejad is out now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/4CF8135300000578-5811449-In_typical_style_he_cracked_a_joke_about_needing_a_new_watch_aft-a-32_1528280563865.jpg","title":"Michael McIntyre confirms continue Big World Tour","story":"    Michael McIntyre gave a cheeky grin after he told MailOnline today he was \u0027feeling better\u0027 after his terrifying knifepoint robbery           In typical style he cracked a joke about needing a new watch after the gang grabbed his Rolex admitting without one he could be late          McIntyre (pictured with his ten-year-old son) was mugged by two masked moped robbers on Monday as he prepared to drive away from school with his boy in North West LondonMcIntyre and young son Oscar, 10, were stopped in a London street by a gang of thugs who smashed his Range Rover with a hammer.The terrifying moment that sums up lawless London: Bystander...London fights back: As a crime wave grips the capital, new...Share this articleMoment masked thug tries to break into car using huge macheteCCTV footage of ISIS member Safaa Boular near the MI6 buildingRobbers flee on moped after robbery at Regent St jewellery shopChilling footage shows body bags being removed from houseIrate cyclist uses CAR HORN to clear pedestrians out of bike lanesTears of joy as grandmother set free by Kim Kardashian sees familyPolice close road at night after a shooting in BrixtonMember of Notting Hill gang seen rapping explicitly in rap videoThe new F35 Lightning fighter jets arrive at RAF Marham in NorfolkTerrifying moment concert goes flee from Las Vegas shootingHarrowing security footage shows people running for their livesMajor fire breaks out at Mandarin Oriental Hotel in KnightsbridgeMichael McIntyre, pictured today in London, will return to the stage tomorrow night in Dublin to continue his 104-date Big World Tour, which runs until summer 2019  The comedian, pictured left and right near his home, has tour dates in Ireland and Scotland this month before coming to London in the autumn. He was pictured wearing a different watch today (left) after the theft of his £15,000 Rolex          Pictures taken shortly after the attack show the driver\u0027s side window smashed and damage to Mr McIntyre\u0027s door          Pictures show stunned comic Michael McIntyre speaking with police moments after he was robbed by a moped gang        Footage shows a flustered McIntyre, wearing a white shirt, take off his Rolex watch as one of the thieves leers over his shoulder    McIntyre can be seen holding up his hands as one of the men jumps off their moped and threatens him with a knife (circled)Footage, which was obtained by The Sun newspaper, shows a clearly shocked McIntyre standing on the pavement near the passenger seat with his son, as one of the masked attackers demands that he hands over his watch.The attacker then jumps onto the back of the moped, which had no number plates, and the pair speed off as a visibly shaken McIntyre comforts his son.A witness told The Sun: \u0027It was shocking to see. They pulled up to his car as it was stopped by the side of the road near to some traff­ic lights, which were green.\u0027They smashed the window which clearly startled Michael as it would anyone — then he jumped out the passenger’s side and they followed him round.The witness added: \u0027People who saw it were shocked too. No one went to help when it was happening, but it happened so fast, they were gone in seconds. They had hammers and I’m sure I saw one of them with a big knife.\u0027  In a chilling illustration of the moped gang crisis, a young woman was fighting for her life last night after her mobile was snatched by moped-riding thieves. And a motorcycle gang targeted yet another luxury store in London yesterday with pedestrians forced to try to tackle them, wrestling one suspect to the ground.Campaigners and politicians warned the attacks were matched by disturbing rises in stabbings, drug crime and gang violence.London now has a higher murder rate than New York, with more than 70 killings so far this year. Knife crime has also led to the deaths of a 17-year-old boy in Ipswich and of 15-year-olds in Sheffield and Wolverhampton.After an extraordinary day of violence, including the attack on Michael McIntyre, it emerged: Scotland Yard has logged 22,025 motorcycle muggings in 12 months – a rise of 50 per centOfficers revealed that city gangs had set up 650 ‘county line’ networks to sell drugs in towns and villages Police were hunting moped robbers who targeted comedian Michael McIntyre A rank-and-file police leader said officers were wary of chasing them for fear of possible disciplinary action A think-tank said shop theft cost £6.3billion last year – or £270 for every household.David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘A fall in police numbers combined with increasingly violent drug gangs has meant some parts of our cities resemble TV’s The Wire. Violent crime is rising and knife crime is rising as gangs fight over drug territories.’Experts believe a booming illicit drugs market – notably in crack cocaine – is fuelling much of the violence. They have also highlighted the middle-class appetite for regular cocaine.The Metropolitan Police figures showed that crimes committed using mopeds, scooters and motorcycles soared by 50 per cent in the year to May, to 22,025.               As the thugs fled, the 42-year-old rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his son (pictured), who is understood to have been in the car at the time of the attackMr McIntyre, 42, who is worth £38million, was waiting outside a school in northLondon, when he was robbed at around 2pm on Monday.Police are investigating whether the moped gang followed him from his £5.7million Hampstead mansion with the aim of grabbing his Rolex or if he was the victim of a random attack because he was driving a luxury car in a wealthy London suburb. The father-of-two was picking up Oscar, 10, who with his brother Lucas, 13, are the source of a lot of his material in his much-loved stand-up routines. Speaking after the incident, Mr McIntyre said: \u0027I can\u0027t really say what\u0027s happening, we\u0027re in the process of sorting this out. There\u0027s been an incident and we\u0027re dealing with it.\u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here, I can\u0027t say anything. This is not a wind up, it\u0027s ongoing and I can\u0027t share the details.\u0027 Journalist Jane Moore, who is married to the comic\u0027s agent Gary Farrow, believes Michael may have been targeted as soon as his son was in the car knowing the star would not risk them harming him.She told ITV\u0027s Loose Women: \u0027How terrifying - his 10-year-old son is in the front seat of the car, and this guy pulls up alongside and he\u0027s got a hammer. To smash a window like that it takes about 10 or 15 goes. Can you imagine how terrified?\u0027They probably targeted him because he had a child in his car, because as a parent you\u0027re not going to take anybody on, you\u0027re going to say, \u0027have whatever you want, don\u0027t hurt me or my child\u0027\u0027,She added: \u0027Somebody please do something about these gangs\u0027 while fellow panelist Anna Richardson said father and son should seek counsellling and revealed she had needed help after she was robbed in a hotel room in 2016. Mr McIntyre was in the Range Rover with his ten-year-old son  in the front passenger seat, one witness told the Mail. They originally claimed the star fell out of the driver\u0027s side and appeared to try to fight off the robbers during the 30-second attack.He then rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his shaken up son and give him a hug.A friend said today Michael, who is currently on the UK leg of his Big World Tour, is \u0027very shaken by the whole experience\u0027 but was uninjured. The moped gang dressed head-to-toe in black pulled up next to him and smashed their way into his car and demanded his Rolex before they sped away.Mr McIntyre\u0027s wife Kitty was reportedly seen close to the damaged car in \u0027floods of tears\u0027 as police spoke to her husband. Today she left the £5.7million family home  and told reporters her husband was \u0027fine\u0027.  Parents on the school run rushed to comfort the shocked star  and he looked shell-shocked and was heard saying: \u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here\u0027.It\u0027s not known if the comedian was targeted or his £120,000 Range Rover was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.             The robbers used hammers to destroy the driver\u0027s window and demanded his silver watch, worth around £15,000            A serious looking Kitty McIntyre, wife of Michael McIntyre, was photographed leaving the family home in North  London yesterday and said her husband is \u0027fine\u0027      Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan, left, had a £100,000 watch stolen after an armed moped rider stopped his Maserati in Croydon earlier this year. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James, pictured right, was targeted by moped thieves for her phone in MarchMoped riders also stole a £100,000 Franck Muller watch from former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan when he stopped in his Maserati in Croydon.The rider appeared to produce a gun and threatened the businessman through the window.Mr Jordan said his 80-year-old father was also in the car and was \u0027trying to have a pop at the gunman\u0027.A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged over the offence last month. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James was also targetted in March after two moped riders stole her phone near Kilburn station.The 30-year-old model former Celebrity Big Brother star revealed she chased down the thieves and got the phone back after tackling them.She added it was the second time such an incident had happened to her after having her handbag stolen in Barcelona.And Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July.The victim was targeted for a Louis Vuitton bag and Radcliffe, 27, rushed over to tend to him after the offenders sped away.  Raiders tried to steal Evening Standard editor George Osborne\u0027s phone as he left the BBC\u0027s Broadcasting House in May last year. Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July                        Kitty McIntyre left their £5.7million north London mansion at 8.20am on Tuesday morning and drove their eldest son Lucas, 13, to school. Oscar, ten, who is believed to have witnessed the attack was not with her.She returned to their six bedroom home and parked their silver-grey Range Rover sport courtesy car in the driveway.When asked if they were worried for their family\u0027s safety, the aromatherapist said: \u0027No, no. He\u0027s fine.\u0027The three-storey mansion, with a green door, had every blind and curtain drawn.It is not known if Michael, who is one of the most successful comedians of all time, is at home.His Range Rover, with the shattered window, was not outside his home. Moped crime has been described as being \u0027out of control\u0027 in London with 23,000 offences last year - up from 827 reported incidents in 2012. Gangs all over the capital have been trying to rip valuables such as phones and jewellery from drivers and pedestrians including millionaire Simon Jordan, whose £127,000 watch was taken at gunpoint as he sat in his Masarati in March.George Osborne almost had his phone ripped from his hand outside the BBC in May last year and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe ran to the aid of a tourist who was attacked in Fulham. Michael McIntyre had been sitting outside the  school when two masked riders brandishing hammers pulled up next to him.They then smashed through his driver\u0027s window and stole his watch. It is not known if they took other items like his wallet and phone. One witness said: \u0027The guy at the front of the moped started to hit the driver\u0027s window about ten to 15 times and it eventually just cracked. He opens the door and gets Michael McIntyre out of the car. Michael fell but he was still trying to put up a fight.\u0027I just remember one of the bikers trying to get something. I don\u0027t know what the guy was trying to get – a watch, a wallet, maybe?\u0027And then within seconds they were gone down the hill. It was all so quick – the whole thing must have taken 30 seconds\u0027.He added he thought that Michael\u0027s son was in the car with him and was hugged by his dad and school friends afterwards.             Mr Mcintyre was photographed looking shell-shocked by his £120,000 Range Rover after yesterday afternoon\u0027s attack            The millionaire comedian was sitting in his Range Rover at around 2pm yesterday when the thugs started trying to smash his window with a hammerAnother witness said: \u0027I was driving along the road when I saw two men dressed head to toe in black. One man was on the bike and the other was either attacking or fighting Michael McIntyre. There was shouting too.\u0027The driver\u0027s window of his Range Rover was completely smashed. The second guy jumped on the back of the motorbike and they got away\u0027.       1.

When would it be published?

She tried a counter-attack, asking Mr Corbyn if he wanted a second referendum.

In fact there was open derision.Two pro-Leave Tories (Henry Smith and Andrea Jenkyns) felt the need to press Mrs May to provide more reassurance that we will indeed be getting out properly on time. Her replies? Burble burble, mashed potato.We are, it is said, living through the most exciting time in British politics since 1940.

The effort institutions and iniduals are making in the pursuit of teaching excellence is paying idends.\u0027Yvonne Hawkins, director of teaching excellence and student experience at the Office for Students, said: \u0027While we note the survey\u0027s findings on value for money, and the fact that a slightly higher proportion of students feel they have received good value for money this year, significant numbers of students report not being satisfied with their higher education experience.\u0027Overall the results send a clear signal that there is more work to be done.\u0027Dr Greg Walker, chief executive of universities\u0027 group MillionPlus, said: \u0027It is encouraging to see an increase in the number of students who perceive good value for money from their course and that as few as one in 20 current students would not go university if given the choice again after their experience.\u0027I am pleased to see a 3 per cent increase in reported value for money by students at modern universities.

which is handling the CVA, warned that House of Fraser would be at risk of administration if the CVA does no go ahead.He said: \u0027The business has been impacted by the mounting pressures facing the UK high street, with the declining profitability of certain stores exacerbated by costly legacy leases which were originally negotiated many years ago.\u0027With trading conditions unlikely to materially improve in the short term, the future of House of Fraser is at significant risk unless steps to restructure the business both financially and operationally are taken.\u0027A raft of CVAs have been struck in recent months as retailers struggle amid surging costs, rising business rates, competition from online rivals and a slowdown in consumer spending.Other retailers undertaking CVAs in a bid to keep trading include New Look, Mothercare and Carpetright.Restaurant businesses have also been seeking to cut their costs with store closure programmes, with Carluccio\u0027s, Byron and Prezzo all pushing through CVAs this year."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/10/4CFFC72100000578-5816065-image-a-11_1528365119379.jpg","title":"Shocking satellite photos entire towns obliterated Guatemala volcano","story":"Shocking satellite photos of before and after Sunday\u0027s eruption show the town of San Miguel Los Lotes wiped off the map as hundreds of houses collapsed when tons of falling ash crushed them    A closer view of San Miguel Los Lotes shows only a small part of the town is even visible, let alone vaguely intact, after the ash \u0027curtain\u0027 swept through it in just three minutesWhat was once a collection of green canyons, hillsides and farms was reduced to grey devastation by fast-moving avalanches of super-heated muck that roared into the tightly knit villages on the mountain\u0027s flanks.

She was made to start wearing a hijab at seven years old. Masih is pictured smiling with her brother in a new skirt made by her mother, the tailor for the village‘In 2014, before my campaign was launched, police announced 3.6 million women were sent to court for “inappropriate hijab”... 40,000 cars were impounded for inappropriate hijab,’ Masih states. Inappropriate hijab can be a headscarf that does not fully cover a woman’s hair or a hijab deemed to be the wrong colour.Every day, she receives dozens of images and videos from women inside Iran who are resisting the veil, which she shares on her Instagram and My Stealthy Freedom Facebook page. And weekly, on a day she has coined \u0027White Wednesdays\u0027, Iranian men and women wear the colour white to support her campaign.  ‘It started off with women sending photos of the back of their unveiled heads, then standing in hills and nature, then walking in public and then with their headscarf being waved on a stick,’ she says, explaining how women have grown bolder in their approach.To understand Masih’s bravery, it pays to look at her background. She was born in a tiny village of just 650 people, called Ghomikola, in Mazandaran, northern Iran, to deeply conservative and religious parents. In her new book, The Wind In My Hair, she describes how money was always tight and her freedom was always restricted.Masih wanted to climb trees and ride bikes like her older brother, Ali, but she was born in 1976, just two years before the Islamic Revolution overthrew 2,500 years of continuous Persian monarchy and stripped women of their freedom.One of the first laws imposed by the new Islamic regime, was the introduction of compulsory hijab in 1983, meaning women must always wear a veil over their hair when they’re in public.           Masih grew up in a religious family in a tiny village in northern Iran. She is pictured here with her grandmother, mother, sister, brother Ali. Masih is seen aged six in a headscarf (far right)Forty years later, Masih is helping women in Iran to ‘take their bodies back’ after they were ‘held hostage by the Islamic Republic of Iran’. She has recruited an army of millions of social media followers to help fight her battle. Masih was jailed at the age of 19. Not because she was unveiled but because she ‘became involved with student activists... we were all teenagers’.It was in a tiny cell, after hours of interrogation, that she found out she was pregnant. Her fiancé, Reza, was also in jail having been arrested first. He had noticed Masih’s periods had stopped and told the guards she was pregnant in the hope it would aid her release.‘We hadn’t had our official wedding party. Getting pregnant before getting married is not acceptable back then, 20 years ago, it was a scandal in my village,’ Masih says.          Masih found out she was pregnant at 19 while locked up in a jail cell. Later, her husband orced her and she lost custody to her son Pouyan. They are pictured here together trying on hats on one of his weekend visits to her house Sex education was non-existent in Iran. Even now, young people are forced to educate themselves about sex via social media. ‘I didn’t know that because my period had stopped it was a sign of getting pregnant…. An interrogator gave me a basket of apples and told me. I was shocked.’Masih was eventually sentenced to five years in prison and 74 lashes. Her sentence was suspended for three years, and Masih went on to marry Reza and give birth to her son Pouyan. But instead of going on to live the traditional, reserved family life the judge had hoped for, Masih’s life was thrown into turmoil when Reza decided to orce her. Iranian law meant it was his choice and he was also award custody of Pouyan, aged four.Masih’s father was ashamed of the orce and wanted her to move home to wait for another husband to come along. Instead, Masih began a career that has taken her from being a fledgling photographer to a parliamentary reporter, broadcaster and now internationally recognised women’s rights activist.Her anti-compulsory hijab campaign began in 2014 when - having received threats to her life and fearing another arrest due to her journalistic work - Masih, aged 33, moved to the UK to study at Oxford Brookes University.  Masih worked as a political reporter in Tehran but was banned from Parliament in 2005. She is pictured on her last day in the Majlis (left), facing MPs angry with her exposes of their corrupt practices          Masih can no longer visit her beloved parents, Zarrin Khanom and Aghajan, in Iran for fear of arrest upon her return. She says her conservative father, who supported the Islamic Revolution, \u0027has been brainwashed several times by the intelligence services\u0027  In her home, near Kew Gardens, she stepped out unveiled into a street lined with cherry blossom. Her partner, Kambiz, took a photo and Masih shared it on her Facebook page. The image, along with her message about how the same act would be illegal in Iran, went viral and began her My Stealthy Freedom Campaign.The cause has grown and grown. One video, shared this week on Masih’s Instagram page, has already had over five million views at the time of writing. It shows men and women in the popular tourist city of Isfahan standing up against the morality police who are trying to arrest a young woman because they believed her hijab is inappropriate.The caption reads: ‘The girl stood up to film them and police took her mobile away. But people supported her by chanting. “Give her mobile back, Leave her alone.” In the end, the police ran away.’Scenes like this are taking place across the country thanks to Masih’s campaign.Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was arrested in February after waving her headscarf from a stick while standing on a traffic island in Tehran (pictured). Masih was relieved when, one week later, Shaparak, who is a mother to a nine-year-old son, told her she would not stop protesting forced hijab          Shima Babaei was one of the first White Wednesday campaigners who answered Masih\u0027s call.  ‘Police used violence against her and her father. I felt so bad… but she sent me a video to share via another person saying “you can’t silence me”,’ Masih says‘The new generation of Iranian women will never ask the government for their rights they just take them. Women are told they can’t sing, but women are singing in Iran. They are told they can’t dance, but they are dancing. They are told they can’t show their, hair but they are doing it... this generation went beyond begging for their rights,’ Masih says.She makes clear she is not against people who want to wear the hijab, she is simply against the law that gives women no choice. ‘Iran should be for both sides, people that love hijab like my mum and sister and people that hate it like me,’ she laughs.                            Women are told they can’t sing, but women are singing in Iran. They are told they can’t dance, but they are dancing. They are told they can’t show their, hair but they are doing it.                         Some critics question whether Masih is putting women in danger from authorities by sharing their images on social media.It’s a question she once grappled with herself. ‘Because of my ‘White Wednesday’ campaign, the authorities announced they arrested 29 women... I was crying loudly in my house in New York and felt guilty,’ she says before explaining how messages from campaigners soon reassured her she was doing the right thing.‘When people tell me I’m putting women in danger it’s nonsense because the Islamic Republic has put women in danger for 40 years,’ she says. ‘They are tired of being humiliated and living in fear.’One brave campaigner, Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was arrested in February after waving her headscarf from a stick while standing on a traffic island in Tehran. Masih was relieved when, one week later, Shaparak, who is a mother to a nine-year-old son, told her she would not stop protesting forced hijab. ‘She told me “every Wednesday I feel useful”... she sent me a photo of herself unveiled in front of the prison after her release.’  ‘These are the Rosa Parks of Iran. They want to be heard. I am here outside of Iran and can help…. Shima was told “your crime is working for Masih” but she told the interrogator “Masih is working for me”.’           When this photo of Masih was taken, next to the stream in her village, she didn\u0027t know it would be the last time she would visit her home           Masih is pictured here with her second husband Kambiz Foroohar, who she now lives with in New York. An Iranian hard-line conservative website posted this picture of them online and labeled her a prostitute for appearing without a hijab Masih recounts a story of the time she went to the seaside fully clothed ‘not even in a burkini, proper clothes’. She went into the sea and was arrested simply for getting wet. ‘We were interrogated for a few hours about why we did it,’ she says incredulously. Police accused her of wanting to get men excited.‘Every day you come out of school and they treat you like a criminal,’ she adds.Fighting against the almighty Iranian regime, without weapons, may seem like an impossible struggle. But Masih, an eternal optimist, believes the battle is already won.‘The government has guns and bullets, state TV and the media. Our people only have their mobile phones but we won the battle. People are breaking through the censorship through social media. You can now see the true face of Iran. No one can ignore us anymore… they can’t say hijab is our culture anymore.’Masih believes there is a fear in the West about standing up against compulsory headscarf laws for fear of being deemed ‘Islamophobic’.‘What makes you Islamophobic is keeping silent about injustices like Sharia law, when you see women suffer and you keep silent that is causing Islamophobia.’           Masih has not seen her son Pouyan (pictured together) for more than a year due to Trump\u0027s travel ban, which has stopped Iranians from travelling to the U.S. At school in Iran, boys are forced to cut their hair to a minimum but when Pouyan moved to Oxford he let his curls grow like his mother          In 2016, the Iranian government allocated $1.7 billion for the protection of hijab - compared to $49 million for the protection of the environment. Masih now lives an unveiled life in New York while fighting for the rights of millions of women back home to choose how to dress Masih now lives with her second husband Kambiz in Brooklyn but she does not have a British, American or Iranian passport. Thanks to President Trump’s travel ban, this means she has not seen her 21-year-old son Pouyan - who is studying in England - for more than a year.‘The travel ban hurts ordinary people like me. It affects students, tourists, and human rights activists,’ she says.Masih is a woman who has endured a lot of pain in her life but it is only when talking about how much she misses Iran that she sounds tearful.‘If I had the chance to be in my own country and have the same voice as I have in America, I would definitely go back because I miss my country…‘But I was disrespected since the age of seven, expelled, jailed and never had the chance to be my true self there. Now I’ve seen my book published, I feel bad when I say Americas is not my home because I am respected here.’The Wind in My Hair: My Fight for Freedom in Modern Iran by Masih Alinejad is out now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/15/4CF97E7300000578-0-image-a-33_1528294646354.jpg","title":"Never forget message written sand Omaha Beach veterans mark years D Day","story":"    The poignant message \u0027never forget\u0027 was written in the sand on Omaha beach in Normandy as D Day veterans gathered to remember the invasion          Families of fallen soldiers and dwindling numbers of veterans of the D-Day invasion have gathered in Normandy shore to mark 74 years since the massive military operation that helped change the course of World War II.

The effort institutions and iniduals are making in the pursuit of teaching excellence is paying idends.\u0027Yvonne Hawkins, director of teaching excellence and student experience at the Office for Students, said: \u0027While we note the survey\u0027s findings on value for money, and the fact that a slightly higher proportion of students feel they have received good value for money this year, significant numbers of students report not being satisfied with their higher education experience.\u0027Overall the results send a clear signal that there is more work to be done.\u0027Dr Greg Walker, chief executive of universities\u0027 group MillionPlus, said: \u0027It is encouraging to see an increase in the number of students who perceive good value for money from their course and that as few as one in 20 current students would not go university if given the choice again after their experience.\u0027I am pleased to see a 3 per cent increase in reported value for money by students at modern universities.

In 1970, the first annual Pride month followed, along with the Christopher Street Liberation Day and the first gay pride march in American history, where hundreds marched to Central Park.Years later, Pride month continues to be a time for the LGBT community to celebrate and commemorate. This year, a series of LGBT art exhibitions are popping up, from billboards in Los Angeles to photographs of drag queens.Opening at SOMArts in San Francisco, this group exhibition curated by Rudy Lemcke features politically charged artworks by 15 artists. With the modern LGBT movement emerging out of resistance against violence, oppression and censorship, this exhibition features works “that speak to homophobic, transphobic and gendered violence”, said Lemcke. “It’s about the deep wounds that have shaped our identity as a community.” Among the artists, Jamil Hellu is showing artwork inspired by Russia’s anti-LGBT propaganda law. “I am committed to speaking out against human rights abuses and bringing attention to the sociological ramifications of violence against gay people,” said Hellu. “It’s so important to keep the awareness alive that in many other parts of the world people are still being oppressed and persecuted to death because of homophobia.”The New York artist takes his work outdoors in Los Angeles, showing on a pair of digital billboards on Sunset Boulevard. As part of the Rich Picture, a video art billboard series curated by Jessica Rich, Newsome is showing Knot Variations, which taps into the ballroom culture and vogue dance movement that surfaced in Harlem in the 1980s. “How do marginalized people find some upward mobility by using the culture they create when it’s not being celebrated by the masses until it’s adjacent to whiteness or being recreated by white America?” he asked. “Voguing got going around the same time as the Aids crisis began, and as more people swooped in, the conversation was soon driven by people who weren’t part of the community. It’s not that people can’t participate in the culture, but those who create the culture need to have agency over it. This is work that is with, for and about the community.” The Los Angeles Art Association has partnered up with the city of West Hollywood to present a group exhibition celebrating LGBT life during West Hollywood’s Pride Month festivities. Opening on 8 June, the exhibition is held at Gallery 825, featuring artists including Dwora Fried, who creates mixed media assemblages based on identity, portrait photographer Jim Zver and Xunzhi Sun, who is showing works from his BirthMark series. Peter Mays, executive director of the LAAA, says this exhibition “offers expression, agency and celebration of artists addressing their own, inidual pride experience”. What does a queer portrait look like? Curated by artist Liz Collins, this group show of 95 artworks opening 14 June at the Bureau of General Services – Queer Division offers a look into queer portraiture of today, including former Sex and the City actor, activist and New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon. On a colorful wallpaper, portraits are hung salon-style by artists like India Salvor Menuez, the famed model who founded the Luck You artist collective, singer-songwriter Justin Vivian Bond and JD Samson from the band Le Tigre. “It’s a celebratory, vibrant and sensual experience that lays bare a rich and multifaceted community of creative people at an important cultural site in New York City,” said Collins. “Through the layers of images and varied representations of self and others coming from the queer art world, this exhibition aims to engulf visitors in a world of beings as a celebration of life.” Opening on 9 June at the Leslie-Lohman Museum in New York, this group exhibition features 12 New York artists who work in photography, including portraits of gay couples by Andrew Jarman and snapshots of drag queens by Alexis Ruiseco-Lombera. The goal of the exhibition is meant to examine gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity. “For the artists, photography, the medium of choice, is the weapon and the target,” said the museum’s director, Gonzalo Casals. “It allows them to communicate the complexities of a queer world always about to exist, while transgressing – or ‘queering’, as put by the curators – the traditional forms of portraiture and landscape to give us a glimpse of a queer future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/948084d12f34edaf4929b0d381e8cf92d5303fc3/0_0_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daadbdfff8bd91c83a43f7ba8b4dd289","title":"british sculptors in pictures anne katrin purkiss photographs","story":"Cornelia Parker, Elisabeth Frink, Damien Hirst and Grayson Perry are among the artists Anne-Katrin Purkiss captures in striking portraits"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40fe09336ea7b0ab2ec096c062c9533beb573ef6/0_172_5167_3100/master/5167.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ca942a2c7bd04cf6c3fe5f4e43c55c0","title":"man dubbed australias poo jogger resigns from corporate role","story":"Andrew Douglas Macintosh allegedly caught in a sting operation by a Brisbane residentA Brisbane corporate manager who is alleged to be a serial public defecator after being photographed with his pants down on a suburban street has quit his job.Andrew Douglas Macintosh, 64, was dubbed the “poo jogger” after a story in the Courier-Mail on Thursday morning generated enormous interest on the internet.Macintosh was also a member of a Brisbane council advisory board.He came to the attention of police after a sting operation by a local resident, who set out to catch a jogger suspected of relieving himself on the footpath outside an apartment block more than 30 times.Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noonMacintosh was photographed on 11 May outside the Logan Road block in the southside suburb of Greenslopes.

The drastic cuts form part of a rescue plan that will also lead to the company moving out of its head offices in London and Glasgow.The House of Fraser chairman, Frank Slevin, said: “The retail industry is undergoing fundamental change and House of Fraser urgently needs to adapt to this fast-changing landscape in order to give it a future and allow it to thrive. Our legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base, which, without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business. “So while closing stores is a very difficult decision, especially given the length of relationship House of Fraser has with all its locations, there should be no doubt that it is absolutely necessary if we are to continue to trade and be competitive.”The restructuring is a condition of a deal that will give control of House of Fraser to the Chinese owner of Hamleys.House of Fraser’s CVA comes after a string of retailers and restaurant groups have used the process to close outlets, including Mothercare, Carpetright, New Look and Jamie’s Italian.On Thursday, landlords called for an urgent government review of the rise in use of CVAs, which they say risks undermining the UK’s reputation and deters investment in town centres.The British Property Federation said it believed the process was being mis-used.Melanie Leech, the chief executive of the landlords’ group, said: “The CVA process is intended to be part of a comprehensive business recovery plan. Property owners, looking after savers’ and pensioners’ money, will support businesses who demonstrate this commitment but must protect those pensioners against unfair action that penalises their interests.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01def260ced3f2ac361732e6bcd0dae4552657a3/6_41_2966_1780/master/2966.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b27c9ac163921466322012c5f2bac45","title":"thames water to pay 65m back to customers as part of penalty package","story":"Ofwat finds company’s board did not have ‘sufficient oversight and control’ over fixing leaksThames Water, Britain’s biggest water company, is to pay back £65m to customers as part of a £120m package of penalties after being castigated by the regulator for its failure to tackle leaks.An Ofwat investigation found the company’s board did not have “sufficient oversight and control” of its leakage performance.The £65m payment to customers is on top of £55m in automatic penalties incurred by the company for missing the commitment it made to customers to cut leaks. Following Ofwat’s investigation, Thames has agreed to bring forward the payment of these automatic penalties. Each Thames customer will receive a total rebate of about £15 over the next two years. The money will come from the firm’s shareholders, most of whom are pension funds.The Thames chief executive, Steve Robertson, apologised to customers and vowed to put things right. All customers will benefit from a rebate in next year’s bill and further price reductions from 2020-2025, he said.Robertson added: “We met our leakage targets for a decade but our recent performance has not been good enough. We let our customers down and for that we’re sorry. We have taken more control of how we manage the network and are investing significantly more in people and resources to tackle leakage, get back on track and then go beyond.”He said the company was fixing about 1,000 leaks a week and that senior managers would only be rewarded for reducing leaks when targets are hit.The news comes only days after the bosses of England’s privatised water companies were criticised by the GMB union for banking £58m in pay and benefits over the last five years while customers have been faced with above-inflation rises in their water bills.Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has called for a crackdown on excessive pay and offshore financial arrangements to avoid tax at water companies in recent months. On Wednesday, he launched a further attack on “crony capitalists” who had “rigged the system”.Ofwat’s investigation found that Thames breached two of its legal obligations through poor leakage management. It concluded that Thames’ board and management did not pay enough attention to reducing leaks and that the company underestimated the significance of its underperformance when assuring Ofwat it was meeting its statutory obligations.Ofwat’s chief executive, Rachel Fletcher, said: “Thames Water failed its customers in tackling leakage and the measures we’ve announced today illustrate the scale of the company’s shortcomings and how seriously we take them.”Separately, the energy company SSE has been fined £1m for sending out 1.15m inaccurate and misleading annual statements to 580,000 pre-payment meter customers between 2014 and 2015. The penalty will be paid into the energy regulator Ofgem’s consumer redress fund administered by the Energy Savings Trust, which supports consumers in vulnerable situations.The energy regulator said because of an IT coding error, these statements had inaccurate information on the alternative cheaper tariff available to customers and on how much they could save. Ofgem added that SSE failed to act promptly to put things right and also failed to communicate adequately with affected customers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc7e9a8e729735029eacd3f0e05b49b639790f0a/240_528_5520_3312/master/5520.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e10d6b23666ae744f914b9486aa0ab8","title":"destitution system poverty standards of living","story":"In an era of 24-hour news, there are still some stories that make you stop in your tracks. The research published today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) and Heriot-Watt University is one such: more than 1.5 million people were destitute in the UK last year. That includes almost 650,000 with physical or mental health problems, and 365,000 children.“Destitute” is one of those terms that conjures up the Victorian era – a living standard that’s so sparse, so uncivilised, it feels as if it belongs in a history textbook. That this is happening to anyone in the 21st century in one of the richest nations on Earth is shameful. But the scale of it is staggering: 1.5 million people. That’s more than the populations of Birmingham and Liverpool combined.To be classed as destitute by the researchers, in the previous month a person or their children had to have gone without two or more of six basic essentials: shelter, food, heating, lighting, appropriate clothing or footwear, and basic toiletries such as deodorant and toilet roll. (Nearly half of all destitute households reported lacking three or more of these essentials.) It reads like a coldly academic tick list, but really it’s a measure of what a human being needs to live – and of what so many are now going without.Poverty has long been put down to mythical causes, be it a quirk of society – as if inequality is built into the earth – or an inidual’s failings (why don’t they breed less? Work harder? Buy fewer cigarettes?). The JRF study is unflinching at skewering this. The reasons for destitution are complex, but the researchers point firmly to the role of “welfare” cuts that have dominated the political landscape since the global financial crash. Social security policies can, in many cases, directly lead to destitution “by design”, the report says, leaving people “without support when they most need it”. Two in five destitute people reported problems with the benefit system, with a quarter of all interviewees citing losing their disability benefits as a key trigger of their destitution.“We moved into the food bank a few weeks ago ... ” explains one woman. She’d been hospitalised and in a residential programme to recover for six months, but her personal independence payments were stopped regardless. At the same time, her family was hit by the bedroom tax. “We can barely afford to get by, we couldn’t afford to live ... It was just all a nightmare,” she says. Other factors in triggering destitution were found to be harsh debt-recovery practices (mainly by public authorities and utilities companies), the extra costs of disability, the high rents that have dominated the housing market in recent years, and the low level of benefits received by migrants.The report documents people’s desperate solutions – piecemeal kindness and exploitation to fill in the gaps of a less secure safety net: chip shops giving free fish and chips a local vicar helping to pay for groceries taking a risk on a loan shark.Some people, most achingly, had been without food off and on for so long they were almost resigned to it. This level of deprivation isn’t only about going without a meal or electricity. It’s a psychological assault: depression, severe stress and anxiety were commonly reported, with a few interviewees saying that they had even felt suicidal.There’s a risk that, with news of surging food bank use and children going without beds or clothes, this type of extreme poverty is becoming normalised. That it is somehow a natural part of any country or that, even if it isn’t, the problem is now so big, so overwhelming, that we can’t do anything to stop it. Of course, this isn’t true. For proof, look at the fact that the researchers found destitution has actually decreased in the past two years – an improvement put down in large part to the less stringent use of benefit sanctions (as well as improvement to the job market and reductions in migration). Further commonsense changes would go a long way towards pulling more people out of hardship, from embedding local welfare funds for families to seek out in times of financial emergency, and addressing debt recovery processes, to adapting universal credit so that the benefit system is no longer characterised by delays, sanctions and freezes.Above all, there needs to be a culture change that says everyone in this country deserves, at the very least, food in their stomach and a roof over their head – whether that’s a disabled person, a banker, an immigrant or a politician. Destitution should have gone out with the slums and workhouses. So-called modern Britain is crying out for change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f82acad04dbc95abd8eb0150ea6d39e545f03c13/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9047bb4ad11fe7bc45581682fd5f68f0","title":"england identity politics left right","story":"Progressives need to engage seriously with England’s mood and England’s needs – or cede the ground entirelyWe will be hearing a lot about England over the next few weeks as the World Cup gets under way. But this column is not – at least not explicitly – about football, English or otherwise. It’s a column about England itself. It is a column about the country whose name is surprisingly rarely referenced outside the sporting context, yet a country with which the overwhelming majority of people living in these islands strongly identify.A lot has been written since 2016 about whether the Brexit vote marked an eruption of English nationalism. My experience is that this debate gets ahead of itself rather too easily and that those who make the claim sometimes put their fingers on the scales for reasons of their own. Explicit English nationalism remains nonexistent or dormant, not active, unlike other nationalisms in these islands. That the Brexit vote was, in part, an immense expression of English identity is, on the other hand, beyond dispute.There is much else in the BBCYouGov survey, but we must press on into the politics of what this all means. What the survey shows is that England means an awful lot to an awful lot of people. It also shows that it can’t be treated as more or\u0026nbspless the same thing as Britain. It shows that political\u0026nbspsilence and evasion about England are no longer an option.Many on the left prefer the silence. Some find England embarrassing – a “not in my name” country. Many prefer to navigate the multiple identities of Britishness while leaving the self-identifying English alone. As a result the left of centre is not much represented in the English conversation. I suspect that the English have noticed.Labour embodies this unease. Few Labour\u0026nbsppolicy documents mention England at all, even when they concern policy areas such as the health service or education, which are devolved and on which, therefore, “national” policy actually means English policy. Faced with English identity, Jeremy Corbyn is little different from Tony Blair or Gordon Brown. This week Brown made a fine speech about bringing the country together with a programme of reforms. Yet the word England appeared just once in his speech, and only in the context of English regionalism, not English identity. It is hard to think of any senior Labour politician since Tony Benn or Michael Foot who talked about England with any degree of comfort. Their view of England may have been unduly romantic and radical, but at least it existed.This isn’t intended as a bash-Labour point. For the most part, Labour is no better and no worse than anybody else on the liberal left in this regard. There are honourable exceptions, notably the former minister John Denham, no longer in parliament but actively pushing his English Labour Network. A recent Institute for Public Policy Research speech by the maverick shadow cabinet member Jon Trickett was another important recognition of the need for a political conversation to develop on the left that includes, not ignores, England.England is not going to go away. And the current English mood is a challenge to every aspect of the progressive tradition. As the BBCYouGov survey shows, England is not just a place with a real sense of identity. It is also a pessimistic place. Most people in the survey think England was better in the past. The pessimism is widely shared across all parts of England. Only one in six people in England think the country’s best years lie ahead of it.But this pessimism is not something that need embarrass the progressive traditions in politics. There isn’t much sign of a harking back to whiteness or for the empire. It’s about feeling that the country is incredibly beautiful, has a rich history, and is witty and polite. But the country also used to make things, used to matter more, used to be more caring and connected. The England that cries out from this survey is not at ease, is disempowered, is disconnected from Westminster and insufficiently able to shape its own future at local, never mind national, level.English identity is a cultural issue that requires more than just a constitutional answer. Nevertheless, England is the largest nation in Europe without its own parliament and it has become difficult to argue against one, with powers similar to those in the rest of the UK. An English parliament would force the progressive wing of politics to engage seriously with England’s mood and England’s needs. Compared with an English parliament, combined or regional authorities just don’t cut it.And what is the alternative? If the progressive tradition in British politics cannot find ways of listening to, connecting with and speaking for England, its sense of itself and its sense of place, it risks not just electoral failure but the loss of a much larger argument. To cede the politics of England to the right is to ensure that it is the right that speaks for England. That is what is happening. Yet it does not have to be this way. Bear that in mind as you watch Harry Kane and his team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30c4182480eaf289e56e0f78bb307b8454a58dca/0_86_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0589b3f479348362746f1481da42dbf","title":"mcqueen directors fashion creates icons then isolates them","story":" The makers of a new doc about the late designer tell how they set out to present a nuanced picture of an insecure man and his joyful adventuresBefore there was Sarah Burton’s Alexander McQueen, the chic, highly finessed and now financially successful fashion label, there was the Alexander McQueen of its namesake that – as this touching new documentary tells it – could barely sustain the creative dysfunction its creator and his companions wrought upon it.The man at its core, we know, killed himself aged just 40. What story is left to tell? McQueen left behind five distinct silhouettes, or reimaginings for the shape of clothing on a woman’s body: more than Givenchy, Dior, Chanel, Saint Laurent or any other designer, according to the film’s co-directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui.The pair spent a year refashioning existing film of McQueen and his protector-antagonist Isabella Blow, and threading it through with new interviews with McQueen’s family and surviving, if somewhat shell-shocked, collaborators. The result, in the opinion of Vogue international editor Suzy Menkes is “the most sensitive vision about a creative who never lost his rough edges, and who put his life – the bloody history of distant warriors in Scotland and childhood abuse within his family – on stage.” On this journey, we learn that fashion is probably best admired as a playground for creative people to exercise restless and highly stimulated imaginations. McQueen thrilled and terrified his models and clients: a perspiring, huffing beast coming at them with giant tailors’ scissors, wildly cutting at fabric as they stood in the designs. That such people should also swing between intense highs and lows – often to the bewilderment of those around them – should come as no surprise.Ettedgui says there were two questions to answer: how did he become the golden boy of the fashion industry and why, when he was at the top of his game, did he decide life was not worth living? “We were deeply moved by that story,” he says. “The emotions that he created in us – the exhilaration of the early part of the story, or the tragedy toward the end – are what we wanted to put up on the screen.” It is not clear even that McQueen and Blow, who preceded him in death by mere months, should be mourned in the traditional sense both are more successful and better understood from beyond the grave than they were ever this side of it. That is not to say they aren’t missed, intensely in some instances. In some ways, it may be a better way to enjoy the joyful, deluded follies of their adventures. In New York City, when McQueen came to show off his bumster collection – one of his first to gain widespread attention – a model was directed to lurch, mad-cow like, down the aisle in a Lower East Side synagogue. The designer also directed the PRs to slow Vogue’s Anna Wintour and her then sidekick André Leon Talley’s entry to the show. Blow admonished her rebellious protege: “You’ve got to make an effort with her.” Nonetheless, Wintour would later become a champion for McQueen. “As he said it himself, he loved having the opportunity to prick the bubble of the fashion world,” says Ettedgui.Nor is it hard to see why Blow so adored him, and why she was so devastated when he cast her off on signing with a more professional house, Givenchy, then under the direction of Tom Ford. It had, after all, been Blow’s wheeze to get Ford to buy McQueen for the Gucci Group. The deal financed McQueen but by then Blow was judged to be unsuitable and, aggrieved, reinvented herself elsewhere.As it turned out, in some ways, McQueen wasn’t so suited to the fashion life. Or perhaps he was too well-suited. Either way, the documentary speeds up here, as it should, and speeds lightly over his drug problem, his decadence, his efforts to change himself and his appearance, his rages and problematic relationships. He drove himself to work harder. “The fashion industry’s need to reinvent is relentless,” says Bonhôte. “It creates icons, and then isolates them.” McQueen, says Ettedgui, explained it himself. Asked by former Vogue contributing editor and novelist Plum Sykes why he conformed to the fashion system and its frenetic pace when he could, in his position, set his own agenda, the designer said simply “because I’m so fucking insecure”.“The person who put the most pressure on McQueen was McQueen,” says Ettedgui. “We certainly picked up on a lot of finger-pointing but the answer is not as passive as ‘Lee was a victim of the fashion industry.’ It’s much more nuanced than that.” Ultimately, his legacy must be the clothes. When you look at the impact of the V\u0026ampA and Met’s Savage Beauty exhibitions, which were record-breaking on both sides of the Atlantic, people really started to analyse him technically, Bonhôte says. “The five silhouettes he left behind are potentially more than Saint Laurent or Coco Chanel, and that puts him right at the top.”McQueen is in UK cinemas on 8 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0510de64880c1fbaf3cc6c8817dbd081c35dfd0a/0_176_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ade433ffda51a44736f0edb859826051","title":"hereditary toni collette horror grief","story":"The buzzed-about shocker, starring Toni Collette, is the latest horror film to recognize the devastating effect of losing a loved oneA few years ago, a friend whose father had recently died, suddenly and prematurely, asked me to go to the cinema with him. Traditional comfort viewing was not on the agenda: he wasn’t looking to lose himself in a pillowy romantic comedy or a hot blast of action escapism. Rather, his choice of viewing was Let Me In, the slicked-up but still largely downbeat US remake of Scandi vampire tale Let the Right One In. “It’s a bit grim,” I cautioned, unnecessarily. “Grim is sort of where I am at the moment,” he replied, and I could hardly argue with that: sometimes, when your heart and mind are in a particularly dark place, it can feel better to submerge them in more shadow than hold them up to the light.He wouldn’t have been the first bereaved person to massage the raw wound of their grief with the salt of horror cinema: it is, after all, the genre more preoccupied than any other with death, the persistent fear it stokes in us, and the cold void it leaves when it strikes nearby. So many of the best horror films are built around characters themselves in mourning, rendered either vulnerable, invulnerable or a bit of both by the extremity of their pain. To watch Donald Sutherland in Don’t Look Now, haunted by the seeming spectre of his dead daughter, or even the Friday the 13th series, with its grisly chain of grief-motivated massacres, is to see, in a sense, one’s own psychic pain writ large and dripping in blood – you might not feel better for it, but at least you feel seen.I wouldn’t necessarily prescribe Hereditary, out soon in cinemas, to anyone for this (or any other) reason, though Ari Aster’s magnificent directorial debut is the most skin-prickling demonstration in recent memory of cinema’s capacity to look death in the face and scream. It’s an unsubtle, unforgiving horror nightmare for which not everyone will have the upturned stomach for those who do, Hereditary plunges about as deep into the abyss of familial loss, ensuing blame and paralysing sorrow as it is possible to go.Varying in its approach from sleek, serpentine psychological teasing to rattletrap ghost-ride scares straight from the B-movie playbook, it’s a film best approached cold in terms of its plot machinations: if you haven’t seen it and want an optimum first viewing, you’d do best to read little in advance. Aster opens proceedings in a household newly touched by death: the Grahams, a well-off suburban family in one of those roomy American houses so perfect for storing lingering spirits, are preparing for a grandmother’s funeral, though no one seems beside themselves with grief. Speaking to gathered mourners, the dead woman’s daughter Annie (Toni Collette) speaks of her mother in tones of chilly, compromised respect her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) and teenage children Peter (Alex Wolff) and Charlie (Milly Shapiro) look on with a detachment that borders on relief.Something, it seems, has been haunting this family long before the old woman, a secretive believer in the occult, passed away. The mourning process unlocks that trouble in short order, though not as and when we expect: instead, it’s another sudden and brutal death that causes hell to break loose, in more ways than one, as the family is subsumed by more feeling than it can rationally handle. Though Aster’s film would make a fine (albeit nerve-destroying) double-bill with Jennifer Kent’s 2014 sensation The Babadook – another intimate, anxiously escalating study of domestic terror rooted in a loved one’s absence – it manages emotion in very different ways.The Babadook is a narrative of catharsis: much theory has been written about how its eponymous demon is a mere manifestation of the stages of mourning first denied and then endured by its protagonist, a widowed single mother. In Hereditary, however, grief escapes from a Pandora’s box, forever wounding and changing its sufferers with no apparent possibility of healing or renewal. Collette, in the gutsiest and most wrenching performance of her career, plays a woman quite literally and violently possessed by her own grief. It’s a canny bit of casting: in another era-leading horror film, The Sixth Sense, she played a young mother whose unresolved emotional baggage with her own dead mum finally links her to the spiritual world only her son can see. Once again, grief acts as a conduit to the abject and uncanny, though M Night Shyamalan’s ghost story concludes with rather more human tenderness and togetherness than Hereditary does. For some, however, Hereditary may resemble their own experiences of loss and emotional displacement: to watch it is to feel trapped in a tunnel with no obvious light source at either end, but plenty of sound and fury and scratching, scarring pain. Hereditary is unlikely to lift a burden from anyone who watches it, but there’s brute emotional honesty to its freaky worst-case scenario: not every tragedy, it reminds us, shrinks or sinks into the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/850b7cf5f269b175fbbfad0e4c9c5feaa6f29b9e/0_0_3240_1944/master/3240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8945077626e5a9d54fee64cf4cffc8dd","title":"championship financial gap premier league annual accounts","story":"The Championship continues to be a financially punishing league, with 19 of the 24 clubs having made losses in 2016-17, according to an analysis of their most recently published accounts by the consultant Deloitte.The enormous financial gap with the Premier League has for years led Championship clubs to overspend on players’ wages and make losses, in the effort to claim the bonanza of promotion. This is despite financial fair play rules, introduced to try to staunch the losses clubs have historically made in the EFL’s top ision.However the disparity with the Premier League and internal inequalities with clubs receiving parachute payments mean Championship clubs’ finances are difficult. Burton, Leeds and Reading did record pre-tax profits, as did Nottingham Forest, although this was only because of a £40m credit from the previous owner, the Kuwaiti businessman Fawaz al-Hasawi, waiving a loan as part of the takeover by Evangelos Marinakis.Of the 19 clubs who made losses, some were heavy, particularly those sustained by the three clubs which won promotion. Newcastle, who received the first year of £42m parachute payments after relegation from the Premier League, gambled for immediate promotion, sustaining a £47m loss. Their wage bill, £112m, was £26m more than its total revenues for the year. Brighton, engaging in another push to make the top flight, also paid wages substantially greater than their revenues and made a loss of £39m. Huddersfield did the same, making a £20m loss.Whereas in the Premier League, the quality of clubs’ playing squads and finishing position correlates very closely to the wages they pay players, Deloitte commented on the “outperformance” by Championship clubs of their ranking in terms of wages paid. Neither Huddersfield nor Brighton received parachute payments, and the wage bills of both were lower than many others’, with Huddersfield’s, at £21.7m, the Championship’s 15th highest.Yet Deloitte pointed out that although most clubs rely on the financial support of owners, increasingly overseas investors seeking the windfall of promotion, it is five years since the last Football League club collapsed into insolvency.“While we have suggested that the changing dynamics of the Championship may promote greater stability in the future, the reality is that it may take some time until this translates to many clubs being able to operate independently of the financial backing of their owners,” the report said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d74a6db85d07746317f1f5be16f886ec232c9fb1/269_0_3682_2210/master/3682.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93a17d36d51485c2e00b1db662364917","title":"switzerland world cup 2018 team guide tactics key players vladimir petkovic","story":"Everyone is pulling in the right direction in a multi-cultural squad but Vladimir Petkovic is aware of his team’s limitsThis article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.This is a team very similar to the one at Euro 2016 but they have come together as a squad in the past three years and may benefit from that in Russia.There are still a lot of Swiss supporters who cannot understand that the majority of players do not sing the national anthem, but one thing is clear: this team are multi-cultural and the players realise that and are doing their best to come together as a force.It was in May 2015 when the captain, Stephan Lichtsteiner, started the discussion, saying: “Swiss people want to identify with the national team. It is vital to find the right balance and the right mix. My concern is not about ‘real Swiss’ and the ‘other Swiss’ but that the people can continue to identify with the national team. It’s a delicate subject, I know that. But it is also an issue that we cannot ignore.”Lichtsteiner was keen to get players such as Pirmin Schwegler (Hannover 96) and Tranquillo Barnetta (FC St Gallen) involved in the national team but they were not in France in 2016 and will not be in Russia either.The vice-captain, Valon Behrami, who fled Kosovo with his family, has played a big part in getting everyone pulling in the right direction and the national coach, Vladimir Petkovic, says: “Everyone in our team likes to be together with the other players – and they are there for each other. And for me, that is key to any success. We have found a very good formula and the results we have achieved help us to consolidate it. We have invested a lot in these issues. The basic attitude is very positive and the public is extremely appreciative of our achievements. I really appreciate this as there were times when, despite our sporting success, these discussions kept cropping up.”In goal, Yann Sommer is a certainty, as are Fabian Schär and Ricardo Rodríguez in defence. There is a question over whether Johan Djourou or Manuel Akanji will play alongside Schär in central defence. In defensive midfield, Arsenal’s Granit Xhaka and the Udinese “warrior” Valon Behrami are set to start.Xherdan Shaqiri, Blerim Dzemaili and, after Admir Mehmedi failed to recover from foot surgery, Steven Zuber are likely to occupy the three attacking midfield roles, with Haris Seferovic up front. One option, however, is to have Shaqiri behind Seferovic with Breel Embolo on the right.Which player is going to surprise everyone at the 2018 World Cup?The central defender Manuel Akanji is only 22 but already a first-teamer at Borussia Dortmund. Some critics have accused him of rushing things, such as when he moved from second ision FC Winterthur to the serial champions FC Basel at the age of 20 or when he joined Dortmund in January 2018 having recovered from a cruciate ligament injury. So far, though, he has had all the answers and may do again this summer.Which player is likely to disappoint?Haris Seferovic has not had much playing time in 2018 and could struggle in Russia. Would it not have been better to select someone such as Albian Ajeti, who won the Golden Boot in Switzerland last season?What is the realistic aim for Iran at the World Cup and why?Anyone who plays in a group with the five-times world champions Brazil cannot dream of first place. And if you finish second, which Switzerland easily could, ahead of Costa Rica and Serbia, you are likely to face Germany in the last 16 – and then it is time to pack your bags.

It is understood an announcement on his replacement is due in the coming days, suggesting a candidate has already been identified.In recent years Dacre has taken a relentlessly pro-Brexit line, using the Daily Mail’s front page to brand judges who ruled parliament must vote on leaving the EU as “enemies of the people” and last month criticised the House of Lords as “dinosaurs in ermine” after it voted to amend Brexit legislation.Lord Rothermere, the chairman of the Daily Mail’s parent company DMGT, said Dacre was “the greatest Fleet Street editor of his generation” whose “many campaigns, investigations and crusades that have held power to account, given a voice to the voiceless and often set the political agenda through six prime ministerships”.Dacre will remain with the company as chairman and editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers, in addition to advising Rothermere on the changing media landscape.In a statement Dacre thanked Rothermere for giving him the freedom to edit without interference and the backing to assemble “Fleet Street’s greatest team of journalists”, something which was worth “more than all the riches of Araby”.He went on to highlight the topics the newspaper has campaigned on during his tenure, saying: “Whether it has been justice for Stephen Lawrence and the Omagh bomb victims, plastic in supermarkets and in the seas, dignity for the elderly, thwarting Labour’s plans for supercasinos, or putting sepsis and prostate cancer on the map, we have shown that newspapers make a difference.”“Without the Mail, Gary McKinnon, Shaker Aamer and Marine A would probably be in jail and Afghan British army translators, whose lives are now at risk, would not have the chance to live here.”He also praised the campaign against state regulation of the press and pledged to “continue playing as great a part in it as ever”.Dacre’s departure after 26 years in the job will start a fierce competition to succeed him at the newspaper, which sells an average of 1.3m copies a day and continues to have enormous influence over the political agenda. The newspaper’s Saturday edition is now the single biggest newspaper edition in the UK.Potential candidates to take the job include the Mail on Sunday editor, Geordie Greig, who has regularly clashed with Dacre and supported remain in the EU referendum, , MailOnline editor Martin Clarke, and current Daily Mail deputy editor, Gerard Greaves. Consistently Britain’s best-paid newspaper editor, last year he took home £2.5m after he received a bonus on top of his £1.45m basic salary. During his time as editor he built unlikely alliances, becoming good friends with former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, despite their political differences.Although DMGT’s newspaper business continues to make healthy profits, the company is changing its focus towards internet businesses under new chief executive Paul Zwillenberg. Dacre was technically editor-in-chief of the MailOnline website, he repeatedly and publicly made it clear that his newspaper was a very different product with a different editorial line to the celebrity-heavy website."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d49f38a85c2f36de053f7b609473c076a26e8da/0_0_5484_3291/master/5484.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d87d087396d3b465684970525a62a56","title":"ba business class no perks priority boarding check in","story":"There was no priority check-in, no fast-track security or priority boarding, and no extra space between seat rows.

The pair’s first collaboration, ’03 Bonnie and Clyde, was a tale of devotional love accompanied by a video featuring Beyoncé as the ride-or-die moll to her rumoured boyfriend’s gangster. It’s a story they’ve stuck to over the years – this is their second On the Run tour, and the theme remains intact: the film that punctuates this first night show introduces “the gangster and the queen” and keeps returning to an image of a hotel room carpeted with cash. Yet the intervening decade and a half – and an infamous few seconds of CCTV footage from an elevator – has complicated what was once a straightforward way to bolster each other’s brands. Far from living in codependent bliss, theirs is a relationship now defined in the public eye by betrayal and rage. As the pair detailed on their respective recent albums – Lemonade and 4:44 – Jay-Z was unfaithful, almost letting, as the guilty party put it, “the baddest girl in the world get away”.So the narrative has been recalibrated: the pair begin proceedings by hammering home the deathless nature of their love rather than its perfection. On a colossal screen, footage and slogans reinforce this idea of resilience, taking in a staged argument between the pair and never before seen pictures of their baby twins. The effect feels remarkably intimate for a stadium show, but also scrupulously posed – a tone that can feel disorientating as Beyoncé switches between songs about crazed lust and ballads about romantic betrayal (most starkly on 2006’s newly relevant Resentment). But anyone hoping for this psychodrama in cartoonish panto format would have been sorely disappointed. The pair gaze at each other moonishly from the get-go: a vision of matrimonial love that, considering they are explicitly cashing in on their interpersonal trauma, can come off as slightly one-dimensional.Which is not to say the show that services this message isn’t staggeringly impressive. The Beyoncé-mania that has gripped pop culture in recent years isn’t just poptimism gone mad: this is a woman who matches increasingly sophisticated and trailblazing material with once-in-a-generation onstage charisma. Her swagger is such that it can feel like the power dynamic between the two performers has been upended – once the sidekick, nowadays she’s the one taking her rapper husband for a ride as he hitches his wagon to her staggering cultural capital. At first, this shift is writ large: Jay-Z initially seems as though he’s keeping the stage warm for Beyoncé while she gets her breath back. By the end though, he’s not been outshone – mainly because of his arsenal of glorious modern classics (99 Problems, Niggas In Paris, Big Pimpin’) and perhaps partly because of his excessive costume changes, which put Beyoncé’s meagre half-dozen sequined leotards in the shade.Where Jay-Z does his hits justice, Beyoncé provides both the little treats – mouthing along to Jay’s raps showcasing a peerless range of screwfaces mercilessly barking “sing it” to her apparently lax fanbase – and a couple of heartstopping one-offs. She’s chameleonic, segueing from an imperious rendition of Lemonade’s Led Zeppelin-sampling Jack White collaboration Don’t Hurt Yourself to operatic singing, flanked by her dancers in a renaissance tableaux. During Sorry, she pauses midway through to turn the lyric “suck on my balls” into a faintly chilling haka-style refrain (hilariously, the song is followed by Jay-Z’s deeply-ironic-in-the-circumstances 99 Problems).While Beyoncé’s recent shows have been characterised by identity and politics – her Coachella performance celebrated black college culture her Superbowl show paid tribute to the Black Panthers – that’s not the MO here. But the slivers of material in that department are worth waiting for. Excerpts from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s We Should All Be Feminists speech gets pride of place on the massive screen Sorry is punctuated by Beyoncé asking women in the audience whether they’ve “had enough”, in highly charged fashion. Jay-Z takes the mantle when it comes to race, airing the video for 4:44’s The Story of OJ after a female dancer twists and turns to Nina Simone’s Four Women.The pair bow out with their evergreen 2003 hit Crazy In Love, a rendition of Jay Z’s Young Forever, and a film that sees them reconvene at the altar. It is hard to digest this smooth romantic arc when everyone knows how fraught their relationship has been – but that feeling is offset by the sheer majesty of their creative partnership, which surely only death could do part."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca5261c9a98e2fab079be167c64919be7a6a454f/0_122_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93931618475b690d7b076f4d4b83ec1d","title":"customs backstop we expect a time limit stresses david davis","story":"PM battles to restore cabinet unity over proposal to avoid Northern Ireland hard borderTheresa May is facing a dramatic cabinet showdown with David Davis, the Brexit secretary, over the government’s final backstop plan to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.As the inner cabinet meets at Downing Street to thrash out the final details of the customs fall-back plan, Davis is expected to push for a firm end date to be included in the agreed text.Davis did not rule out resigning if the government’s proposals did not have his explicit approval. “That’s a question I think for the prime minister, to be honest,” he told reporters after a speech at the Royal United Services Institute.It leaves the prime minister battling to restore cabinet unity over her customs plans before she flies to Canada later today for the G7 meeting of world leaders. The clash with Davis came as Downing Street also attempted to head off a series of damaging rebellions in next week’s key Brexit votes, by holding talks with leading Tory MPs who voted to remain in the EU.May has publicly committed to a time-limited backstop, but No 10 sources ruled out agreeing to a specific date in the text, suggesting that it would be unworkable. Cabinet sources confirmed that a four-page draft of the backstop proposal circulated to ministers had prompted the fresh row because it did not include a legally enforceable date. Just hours later Davis claimed that discussions over the document were still carrying on. “The detail of this is being discussed at the moment,” he told reporters during a Q\u0026ampA after his Whitehall speech. “It has been through one cabinet committee, is going to another one, and it would be improper of me to pre-empt the negotiation. But I suspect it will be fairly decisive tomorrow.”He added: “I think the prime minister has already made public the fact that we expect to put a time-limit on the backstop proposal.” Davis helped to clinch agreement on the backstop in the cabinet Brexit subcommitee last month, in the face of objections from other leave supporters, including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. Johnson subsequently warned that the prime minister should ensure she delivered a Brexit deal that avoided use of the backstop. “Brexiters fearing betrayal over the customs backstop must understand that the PM has been very clear that it is not an outcome we desire. We want a deal with the EU and she will deliver it,” he said.Davis is understood to believe that offering a deal without a specified end-date would limit his leverage, in talks with Brussels, to negotiate alternative arrangements for keeping the border open. Some Brexiters were irked by the fact they only received the draft of the detailed backstop proposals on Wednesday, claiming other key cabinet members, including the chancellor, had been given longer to consider its wording.Britain signed up to the idea of a backstop in the deal reached with the EU27 in December but May rejected a draft later presented by Brussels that would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the single market. The EU27 has been waiting for the government to publish its alternative draft backstop proposal, which is expected to include all of the UK temporarily applying the EU’s external tariff – a plan that would limit the ability of the trade secretary, Liam Fox, to strike new deals with non-EU countries.No 10 sources said the backstop, which would keep the whole of the UK in key areas of the customs union until a permanent solution to the Irish border problem could be found, would be published today after the meeting. Downing Street played down the row, saying the backstop was only ever intended to be temporary. “It’s important that it’s time-limited even outside of the fact that we don’t expect or want it to happen,” a source said. Allies of the Brexit secretary denied he was considering resigning. When news of the backstop plan emerged last month it infuriated hardline Conservative backbenchers who feared that it could become the post-Brexit norm. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, went so far as to question whether the government remained committed to delivering Brexit. Leading Brexiters told the , however, that they would not be “causing a fuss” about the backstop before next week’s Commons votes. But one warned that No 10 should expect renewed pressure over the date once votes were passed. The Tory chief whip, Julian Smith, told MPs that the EU withdrawal bill would now be debated over two days – next Tuesday and Wednesday – but there would still only be 12 hours set aside. A series of Tory rebel remain MPs, including Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry, Dominic Grieve, and Antoinette Sandbach, were seen entering No 10 for talks.The latest clash between May and her Brexit secretary comes after the pair also disagreed about the timing of publication for a white paper setting out key areas of the government’s Brexit plans.Davis was keen to produce a detailed document before the European council at the end of June, but May is more cautious. She refused to give an answer, when asked by Jeremy Corbyn at prime minister’s questions, when it would be published.After his speech, Davis said: “In debates in Whitehall between fast and slow, I normally vote for fast. That’s probably a given. But what she said today is exactly right – that the white paper will be published when it’s ready, it’s up to quality, and is exactly what we need to say. It will not delay the progress of the negotiations.”Any plan that involves a special status for Northern Ireland is anathema to May’s allies in the Democratic Unionist party, who reject the idea of any differential in treatment between the region and the rest of the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8f7097f03bf656f77e1d2b85438369a91a6dc03/0_0_4913_2948/master/4913.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f790d0db8edbb83d9a08681142cc1d26","title":"david davis urged not to resign over brexit backstop","story":"Allies of Brexit secretary urge him to remain as row over customs union presents PM with one of her biggest crises yetDavid Davis has been urged by key Brexiter allies not to resign as cabinet tensions over customs plans threaten to reach boiling point.The Brexit secretary is facing a showdown with Theresa May over a backstop plan to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland as the inner cabinet meets at Downing Street to thrash out the final details.Davis is understood to be deeply unhappy about the lack of a firm end date in the agreed text, and rumours are swirling around Westminster that he could quit.However, one key ally, the former Brexit minister David Jones, urged Davis to stay in place, saying he was one of the UK’s biggest assets at the negotiating table with the EU.“To contemplate these negotiations continuing without David Davis would be deeply upsetting and deeply dangerous for the country and David Davis needs to stay where he is,” Jones said. Davis is also understood to be frustrated with the slow pace of decision-making on Brexit, the delay to his Brexit white paper until next month and the government’s failure to decide on customs arrangements. On Wednesday he did not rule out resigning if the government’s proposals did not have his explicit approval, although he was said to have told friends he would stay and fight the “people trying to box me in”.The row presents May with one of her biggest crises yet of the Brexit process, with even Tory remain MPs admitting that the departure of Davis – usually regarded as the most loyal of the senior Brexiters – would deeply damage her authority.Jones, a close ally of the Brexit secretary, told the BBC: “I don’t think David Davis should resign – he’s been outstandingly good at his job, he would be a huge loss to the government and I don’t think that we should contemplate that scenario. “We need to make sure that David Davis stays at the negotiating table. He’s one of the government’s biggest assets in these negotiations and anything that caused him to leave would be deeply regrettable and deeply damaging for the country.”Davis is understood to have spoken to the prime minister on Wednesday night. A source described the conversation as “very difficult” and “very stern” on both sides.Several allies have tweeted about the row, with Sarah O’Grady, the wife of Davis’s chief of staff, Stewart Jackson, publicly confirming his fury, and the broadcaster Iain Dale, a friend for 30 years, saying “the political sands are about to shift. Dramatically.” Davis helped to clinch agreement on the backstop in the cabinet Brexit subcommitee last month, in the face of objections from other leave supporters including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. Both are understood to have concerns over the time limit.

However, Brussels is sceptical of the options Britain has already put on the table. Brexiters fear that May’s plan would limit the ability of the trade secretary, Liam Fox, to strike new deals with non-EU countries as well as tying the UK to Brussels permanently.Downing Street had hoped to publish its plans on Thursday morning but it was forced to delay – even though negotiators were already on their way to Brussels – until the row with Davis over a fixed end date is resolved. Some Brexiters were irked by the fact they received the draft of the detailed backstop proposals only on Wednesday, claiming other key cabinet members, including the chancellor, had been given longer to consider its wording.No10 is also attempting to head off a series of damaging rebellions in next week’s key Brexit votes by holding talks with leading Tory MPs who voted to remain in the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77fcf3bcb15cfdb15fea16b0901e2596faeafc4d/106_399_1520_911/master/1520.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=078f767a74ee1562359d18256b6b99d8","title":"former brexit minister says mays backstop plan extremely damaging for britain politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenTheresa May has met David Davis in her office in parliament, which sits at the back of the speakers’ chair.

Many  readers will think they spotted that some time ago. But Forsyth is very good on how the Brexiters are ided.The Brexiteers are ided about what to do now. They can, as one of their number explained to me, be roughly split into two camps: hedgers and ditchers.Hedgers believe the single most important thing to do is to get to 31 March, 2019, when Britain will have legally left the EU. They argue that once that has happened, the Tory party will move to replace Theresa May, giving the Brexiteers a chance to get one of their own into No. 10 and to take control of the most important Brexit department of all, the Treasury.The hedgers argue that this new administration could then set about negotiating a trade deal with the EU. They point out that the withdrawal agreement is unlikely to go into any real detail on the future trading relationship between Britain and the EU, so a new prime minister would not have his or her hands bound too tightly. On top of this, they add that with Britain out of the EU, the Remainer resistance in the Tory ranks should ease making it easier to win key parliamentary votes.The ditchers argue that what’s needed now is a last-ditch effort. They vigorously dispute the hedger analysis. They plan to stiffen Theresa May’s spine and get her to commit to ‘max fac’, the Brexiteers’ preferred customs arrangement, and the ability to erge from EU rules. They say, with some justification, that once Britain has agreed to pay the orce bill, which it will have done by March 2019, then a large part of our leverage will have gone — and with it the chance of a good deal. They say that to rely on the Tories changing leader is a big gamble, because May has no intention of going anywhere. Those around her are convinced she can redeem herself in time for another general election campaign. The ditchers add that even if May goes, it isn’t certain that a Brexiteer would replace her. With multiple Leave candidates, the winner could again be a unity candidate, elected because they don’t have any particularly strong views on this most isive of subjects.And in the Daily  Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, the paper’s international business editor, reckons it’s curtains for true Brexit. This is how his column (paywall) starts.Brexiteers, bring out your black suits of mourning. Grieve with private dignity. The quixotic bid for British independence has failed. There will be no return to full sovereign and democratic self-rule in March 2019, or after the transition, or as far as the political eye can see. Britain will be bound and hemmed until the latent contradictions of such a colonial settlement cause a volcanic national uprising, as they surely must.The Westminster class is edging crablike towards a double embrace of the EU single market and the customs union, the full EU package but without a veto in the European Council, or Euro-MPs with heft in the dominant blocs of Strasbourg, or judges on the European Court (ECJ) to lean against top-down “Napoleonic” jurisprudence.

You can’t keep yourself clean or put the lights on. This shouldn’t happen to anybody, let alone over one and a half million people in the UK.”The re-emergence of destitution-levels of poverty among low-income families over the past two to three years has been noted by poverty campaigners, including the Labour MP Frank Field, who recently argued that for “the first time in postwar history, the state has become a generator of destitution”.The study says that even aside from the design problems in universal credit, basic benefit levels are inadequate for many claimants. It notes that single benefit recipients living alone under 25 are by definition destitute because basic job seeker’s allowance rates are so low, and have been frozen for more than two years. The study, by researchers at Heriot-Watt University, noted a sharp fall in the number of destitute people reporting that they received help from local authority hardship schemes, which have been dramatically cut in recent years.At the same time, there was evidence of a large increase in the use by destitute people of handouts from churches and charities, including food banks, a trend the study noted was “an ever more humiliating experience”.Destitution had a deep impact on mental health, with depression, stress and anxiety commonly reported.Although the study estimates overall levels of destitution are proportionately lower than when the last study was conducted in 2016 – mainly because of of higher employment levels and an easing off in numbers of benefit sanctions – it warns that this trend could reverse because of rising levels of sanctions under universal credit. Single younger men were most likely to become destitute, the study found. Although migrants and refugees – who have limited or no access to benefits or paid work – were vulnerable to severe poverty, three-quarters of those who were destitute were born in the UK.A DWP spokesman said: “Work is the best route out of poverty and our welfare reforms incentivise employment while having the right support in place for those that need it. Universal credit lies at the heart of our commitment to improve lives, and it is seeing people move into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a00f448171401add474582a0182f492f5d303688/0_175_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbdb82bd75370bd7828655bfb91fc12a","title":"rules daniel ricciardo no chance canada monaco f1","story":"The unadulterated delight Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo displayed after winning in Monaco was entirely understandable. After finally claiming the Monte Carlo victory he so desperately wanted, riding a wave of ecstatic emotion was wholly deserved. This week at the Canadian Grand Prix, however, the Australian will be brought back to earth with a painful reminder of the realities of Formula One. He will doubtless still be grinning but likely through gritted teeth in Montreal.He now has two wins this season, the same as Hamilton and Vettel and, but for retirements because of an engine problem in Bahrain and his crash with Max Verstappen in Baku, would likely be far closer than the 24 points he trails Vettel, who is second behind Hamilton in the world championship. His Red Bull would have been up against it this weekend on the power‑hungry straights of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, but any hope he might have had of narrowing the gap has gone before he has turned a wheel in anger.The failure of the MGU-K means he will take a third replacement in Montreal, one more than is permitted and consequently a 10-place grid penalty. More may follow. He has also already used the maximum number of batteries and control electronics, replacing either will add five further places each. Red Bull’s chief technical officer, Adrian Newey, said they are waiting to hear from engine supplier, Renault, on the fate of the battery.Ricciardo, who might play a part in the title fight, may start from the back of the grid. Amid all the talk of F1’s future, successfully addressing this is a key task facing the sport’s owners Liberty Media.Ricciardo is not being singled out unfairly and the rules, instigated as a way of attempting to control costs, apply to all drivers. But his case does illustrate again how damaging they can be for the sport. Liberty has indicated that building the fan base is at the heart of its plans. This is far from just about numbers but increasingly appears to be central to how F1 survives in future.The old model of exorbitant race fees and broadcasting rights as the sport’s central incomes is clearly being considered and already Liberty has begun offering direct sale of races to fans. If this model continues and expands, keeping those paying fans and bringing in new ones will be fundamental to F1.The Canadian Grand Prix will be a tough sell to anyone who might want to tune in to see how Ricciardo fares after his Monaco win only to discover he does not have a chance before the weekend has begun. The same confusion and disenchantment would be felt by supporters of any driver, but it is particularly poor publicity when it affects race winners and those in the title fight.Equally, even when not impacting on the front of the grid, it can be farcically complex. Last season a total of 740 grid penalties were imposed for power unit changes alone – not including gearbox replacements. At Monza the situation reached a nadir. Nine drivers took penalties accruing 150 places and changing the qualifying results to such an extent that Hamilton on pole and Romain Grosjean, who crashed in Q1, were the only drivers to retain their original positions.There has been no shortage of critics and Newey was understandably unhappy. “We could be suffering some quite big penalties,” he said. “We are only allowed two batteries and the system in that sense seems completely wrong.”F1’s sporting director, Ross Brawn, has been unequivocal in his distaste for the penalties and has incisively identified why it matters so much in Liberty’s new vision. “For a fan to stomach that his hero is on the back of the grid because he had to change the engine, that’s not great sport,” he said.“We’ve got to find a solution to that, either through a different form of penalty or to remove the penalty altogether and just live with the problem that it was trying to fix.”When Liberty announced its five-point plan for the future of F1 at Bahrain this year it acknowledged that addressing the issue was central to the new regulations set for 2021, stating that it intended to “reduce the necessity of grid penalties”.Change before then seems highly unlikely given that the system is linked to the current design of power units. But the problem illustrated by Ricciardo’s predicament is that it impacts so directly on the entertainment side of the sport and in a way that is impenetrable to casual fans. Addressing it correctly for 2021 is more important than ever but just as new aero rules have been imposed for 2019 this is another area where Brawn and Liberty might at least look into fast-tracking an interim alternative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf72137241200bd2a7f404f13d6efe6a484cb13b/0_25_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a5c121b017bb62aa8466e40cdb9af5a","title":"talking horses obrien has secret thoughts in key leopardstown race horse racing tips","story":"Aidan O’Brien often introduces a classy runner in the opener at Leopardstown on ThursdayThe juvenile event which opens the card at Leopardstown this evening is arguably the most interesting contest in Britain or Ireland today, as it is the race in which Aidan O’Brien’s September made a successful debut last season before following up 16 days later in the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot.It is also the contest in which the outstanding filly Minding made her first appearance in 2015, three months before the first of her seven Group One wins, and Together and Bracelet, who both went on to win at Group One level, are also among the winners since 2010, so this is clearly a race that O’Brien bears in mind for the most promising of his juvenile fillies.O’Brien has three of the nine runners in this year’s renewal and the booking of his son Donnacha, fresh from his win in the Oaks last week, aboard Secret Thoughts suggests that she is seen as the pick.

But he’s not all aggression, you know. This time he changes up the pace with a cute drop-shot. Schwartzman, even with his speed, isn’t getting to that. Nadal breaks again and is running away with this third set.The way Nadal has performed so far today, and the way he played after the rain break yesterday, raises the question as to why he was so passive for the first set and a half of this match. Sure, the sunnier conditions today suit him better, but mentally he’s so much more switched on now. He races to 40-0. And then thwacks down a first serve which Schwartzman hits so high into the skies it probably landed in the River Seine.Schwartzman slides 0-30 down on serve. He’s won only one point since the resumption. Make that two, as he improvises with a lovely lob that Nadal can’t reach. 15-30. And then three, it’s 30-all. There’s a loud “VAMOS! VAMOS!!” after the next point but it’s not Nadal with his trademark cry but instead Schwartzman, because he’s got himself a game point. And from there the Argentinian holds. This is ominous for Schwartzman, who is broken to 15 at the start of the third set. Nadal then charges bull-like through his own service game to love. He’s clearly up for this. In contrast to your game-by-gamer, who’s dosed up on a cocktail of hay fever medication and is feeling rather drowsy.Meanwhile on Chatrier Nadal, having resumed at 5-3, 30-15, has two set points of his own at 40-15. Schwartzman slams his return into the net! Nadal is striding purposefully back to his chair, safe in the knowledge that normal service has been resumed.There’s no time for Cilic and Del Potro to find their feet on Lenglen. They resume at 5-5 in the tie-break, and Del Potro takes the opening point of the day, on his serve, to bring up the first set point of the contest at 6-5. It’s on Cilic’s serve. The pair go backhand to backhand, backhand to backhand, backhand to backhand to backhand, before Cilic decides to run round his. He shouldn’t have changed tack. Cilic clunks his forehand into the net and Del Potro takes the first set! Here they come, both weaving and winding their way through the corridors under the stadium. Nadal is towering over the diminutive Schwartzman. Which makes what Schwartzman did yesterday all the more remarkable.

Elizabeth Strout’s first-person narrative, longlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2016, however, breaks the rules and fits perfectly on the stage. That’s partly because of the quality of the writing and partly because of a beautifully nuanced solo performance by Laura Linney: a space that recently looked underpopulated with a four-character play, suddenly feels colonised by Linney’s commanding presence. Fans of the book will know that it is the reminiscence of a writer hospitalised for nine weeks in New York by a mysterious illness. But the focus is on five days when the eponymous heroine renews acquaintance with her mother, who has come to visit her from rural Illinois and from whom she has been long estranged. The two women talk, gossip about people from Lucy’s past, warily seek each other’s love. In the end, the mother departs as abruptly as she came and you feel the two women have briefly bonded without ever addressing their shared guilt: in the mother’s case, over Lucy’s impoverished childhood and, in Lucy’s, over her own necessary desertion.It sounds slight: in fact, it’s a story full of mysterious resonances. What comes out in performance, even more than in reading the book, is the idea that, even if you totally reinvent yourself, your past remains inescapable. Lucy has sought to overcome a childhood in which she and her siblings were beaten and deprived of the consolations of TV, films and magazines. Her father, who fought in the second world war, suffered from what we would now call post-traumatic stress disorder. Fleeing Illinois, Lucy has settled in New York, married, had children and acquired the ruthlessness that is part of a successful writer’s equipment. Yet, as Lucy admits, the Barton family provided a structure she was unaware of, until it was ended by death. Although I was sorry not to hear more of Lucy’s literary mentor, Sarah Payne, Rona Munro’s adaptation is sensitive to Strout’s structure. Richard Eyre’s production also has a distilled clarity: Bob Crowley’s set consists of a hospital bed and chair, while Luke Halls’s video design modulates between vistas of the gleamingly geometric Chrysler building and Illinois acres of soybeans and corn, which seem to stretch to infinity. But it is Linney who triumphantly carries the evening. I’d seen her once before on stage, in Eyre’s Broadway production of The Crucible, where she caught perfectly Elizabeth Proctor’s puritan severity. Here she switches easily between different modes. She talks to us, the audience, with warmth and ease. When she characterises Lucy’s mother, prattling on about the marital misfortunes of sundry relations, her voice acquires a rasping, midwestern edge. As Lucy relives her hospital memories, Linney is even more extraordinary: she shifts between exasperated fury at her mother’s wilful incuriosity and loving astonishment at this unworldly old woman’s ability to negotiate labyrinthine hospital corridors and the New York jungle. You can see the story in several ways but it is partly about the enforced loneliness of the writer who, at the same time, reinforces our common humanity. Linney, as a performer, has mastered the art of public solitude and gives you the uncanny feeling that you are listening not to an invented story but a slice of lived experience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c90726839a6e90168dfe6ecba072f16e38618d/0_0_3675_2205/master/3675.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=199b98df08344ecccb5431473cee3e25","title":"marshall major iii bluetooth review wireless headphones","story":"The much-loved British brand has improved its wireless on-ear range, perfect for metal and hip-hop heads alikeThe Marshall Major III Bluetooth headphones are the latest in the much-loved British audio brand’s wireless headphone range, and while the changes are minor over the last pair they are still a winning combination of look, sound and battery life.You’d be hard pressed to notice the difference at first glance between 2016’s Major II Bluetooth and the new Major III Bluetooth. But compare them side by side and you realise they are slimmer and better looking, maintaining the classic Marshall styling in black vinyl.In fact, the new headphones are 24g lighter, which combined with softer ear pads make them a touch more comfortable to wear. They still squeeze my head pretty hard, but the top band does give a bit so they will eventually wear in.They are on-ear headphones, meaning they sit directly on your ear, not around it. The arms are slimmer and simplified, but maintain their height, twisting and tilting degrees of freedom so that they sit flat against your ear. The controls have been simplified for the Major III, with the brilliant gold-coloured metal joystick at the bottom of the left phone taking over all functionality. Hold it in for a few seconds to turn them on or off, press it once to pause or play the music, twice to trigger Google Assistant or Siri, tilt it left or right to skip the track and up or down to adjust volume. It all works very well, making you wonder why so many other manufacturers don’t have a similar control scheme.The Bluetooth connection is strong in all scenarios and supports aptX for higher fidelity and lower latency streaming with modern Android smartphones. Pairing is easy – just hold down the joystick for a few more seconds when powering the headphones on and find them on your phone.A standard 3.5mm analogue headphone socket is in the right ear cup for listening wired or when the battery runs out.The Major headphones have always sounded good with rock and similar genres, but the Major III Bluetooth suit a wider range of music types. They still sound great with driving rock music, but feed them something slightly more subtle such as the live version of Hotel California by the Eagles from Hell Freezes Over and you can hear good separation, punchy bass drums and clear vocals. The sound is very direct and those looking for thundering bass will have to look elsewhere. But the Marshalls make anything sound good, from Librarian by My Morning Jacket and Do I Wanna Know? by the Arctic Monkeys at the indie-rock end of things, to hip-hop tracks such as Dr Dre’s Forgot About Dre or Can’t Take It With Me by Blue Sky Black Death.The new Marshalls lasted well over 30 hours in my testing, making them some of the longest-lasting Bluetooth headphones around. You’ll probably be able to go weeks of commuting between charges, even at relatively high volumes.They charge in half the time that the older model did, going from dead to fully charged in around three hours via the microUSB socket in the right earcup.The Marshall Major III Bluetooth only come in black and cost £129, which puts them in the mid-range of Bluetooth headphones. Competitors range from around £50 and up. The previous generation Major II Bluetooth are still on sale for £69, while a wired-only version of the Major III cost £69 and the Marshall Mid Bluetooth cost £169.The Marshall Major III Bluetooth are another brilliant pair of wireless on-ear headphones from the British audio brand that bring great sound, very long battery life and classic styling.They aren’t perfect, squeezing my head a little too hard, lacking NFC for instant pairing and with the cost of Bluetooth headphones coming down over the last couple of years they’re not quite as good value as they were in 2016.But the Major III Bluetooth are packed with small improvements over almost every aspect of the design, fit and sound compared to the previous generation, and worth considering, particularly if you’re into driving rock music.Pros: great sound, long battery life, great controls, fold up for travel, sturdy, great look, good connectivityCons: on-ear design may not be comfortable for everyone, no NFC for one-touch pairing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/954bca152f76e38fbada28c44191871dd50b67be/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e49693326139367375beb4c078ef9de","title":"immigration republicans congress dreamers daca","story":"House leadership scramble to satisfy a ided party ahead of a key meeting, as midterm elections loomThe fates of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants hang in the balance as lawmakers once again rush to accomplish in hours what has eluded Congress for decades: a way forward on immigration.A bloc of moderate House Republicans are challenging far-right conservatives – and their leadership – in the latest effort to secure protections for Dreamers, the nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants protected from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program that Donald Trump terminated. Their rebellion has set the stage for a dramatic showdown over a politically perilous issue that has riven the Republican party – and, some worry, could cost them their majority control in this year’s midterms. House Republican leaders summoned their conference for a private, two-hour meeting on Thursday morning. Their goal is to find common ground where there has long been none and, in doing so, prevent moderates from forcing a series of immigration votes over the objections of leadership.The centrists leading the fight – typically reliable partners of the leadership – say they have grown frustrated by years of inaction on immigration. Now, as many of them face competitive re-elections in districts with Hiic constituencies, they are demanding action on immigration reform.On the other side are the hardliners who have for years refused to compromise on immigration proposals. They worry that passing legislation to protect Dreamers, which some deride as “amnesty”, risks demoralizing conservative voters who zealously support Trump’s “zero tolerance” approach to immigration months before the midterm elections.Somewhere in the middle, at risk of being bypassed by both factions, stands Paul Ryan, the outgoing speaker of the House trying to hold the party together as his power drains away.“Our members are earnest and sincere in trying to understand each other’s perspectives,” Ryan told reporters on Wednesday. “I really do believe that there’s a sweet spot here.”But on the eve of Thursday’s meeting, members involved in negotiating a compromise plan left the speaker’s lobby without striking a deal. “We’re taking steps forward, not backwards,” Mark Meadows, the chairman of the arch-conservative House freedom caucus, told reporters after the meeting on Wednesday. “Hopefully what we’ll see is the objections get smaller and less of a hurdle in the hours to come. We’re down to hours – not weeks.”Should Republicans fail to reach a consensus, moderates have vowed to move ahead with a rarely used parliamentary procedure known as a “discharge petition”. The legislative maneuver would compel the House to take up four immigration bills. As of Wednesday, the petition remained just three signatures shy of the 218 needed to get a simple majority and propel the process to the floor.“We are as close as we’ve ever been” to a deal on an immigration bill, Carlos Curbelo, the Florida Republican leading the centrists’ effort, told reporters after a round of negotiations on Wednesday. But, he said, the moderate coalition would continue to seek the remaining signatures for a discharge petition should their discussions falter on Thursday.Nearly two dozen Republicans have signed the petition. And all Democrats have offered their signatures except for Henry Cuellar of Texas, who remains concerned that the process will pave the way for the construction of a border wall, which he opposes.A clash over immigration has loomed over Congress for months, since Trump ended the Daca program last September. The president implored lawmakers to find a solution and provided them with a framework that is unpalatable to Democrats and moderate Republicans. In exchange for protecting Dreamers, Trump has demanded funding for a border wall and new restriction to legal immigration.An attempt to address the issue floundered in the Senate, when the chamber rejected four immigration proposals in February. The plan that met Trump’s immigration framework received the least support.Courts have ordered the administration to temporarily restart the program while they consider legal challenges to the president’s action. How to address the legal status of immigrants has emerged as a key sticking point in the negotiations, members said. Moderates have advocated for a “pathway to citizenship” for the young immigrants who meet certain criteria while members of the far-right freedom caucus have long derided the concession as “amnesty”.Even if the House overcomes the myriad of stumbling blocks to pass immigration legislation, the path forward would largely depend on the president’s response. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has said he would only bring up an immigration bill if Trump would sign it.Tom Cole, a Republican congressman from Oklahoma, worries that forcing a series of votes on immigration could result in the House narrowly passing a bill supported largely by Democrats that is too generous to satisfy Trump’s demands.“It’s not going to do us any good in the end to pass out of here something with a minority of Republicans that is certain to not get through the Senate, and if it did, to be vetoed by the president,” Cole said. “It might help some inidual members but it’s not going to help the Republican team.”Several House Republicans said they were waiting to see what happens during the meeting – described as a “family discussion” – before deciding whether they could sign on to any specific immigration proposal.Yet Cole remains optimistic that after years of deadlock, a solution is within reach. “When you put people together who are on the same team, more times than not they’ll find a way forward,” Cole said. “Now maybe they can’t. A lot will depend on what happens in that meeting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f995dff4096536dd2afcad57b351b7dc94fa009/0_199_5706_3424/master/5706.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95fb779e517f671a1f15746ca0a0ef27","title":"nicaragua daniel ortega masaya","story":"Daniel Ortega makes yearly pilgrimages to Masaya.

Today, Masaya is once again in full revolt – this time against the Sandinistas themselves.“Daniel must go,” insisted Rosa Caballero, a 48-year-old hotel manager who said she supported the uprising even though the eruption of violence had paralyzed the town and scared away all her guests.“I don’t think there is any way out,” the mother-of-three added. “All this repression. This whole struggle. It cannot be in vain ... I hope other cities join us so it is total pressure against the government.” Unrest began to grip Masaya on 19 April after protests broke out in the capital in response to planned social security reforms – then swelled into a broader, nationwide insurrection against what many call Ortega’s increasingly authoritarian and corrupt rule.But in recent days the violence – which has so far claimed almost 130 lives across the country – has escalated dramatically. At least 10 people were shot dead here over the weekend, allegedly by police and paramilitary gangs operating at the government’s behest. “It was a bloodbath,” La Prensa, an opposition newspaper that has been documenting the carnage, reported of what it called two nights of terror. “Day and night, Masaya seems a city at war.”In the wake of those killings, Masaya’s streets are tense and entirely devoid of any government presence. Dozens of barricades, cobbled together with tree trunks, concrete paving stones, metal signs and nail-studded planks, block the path into the heart of what was once a bustling tourist town famed for its artisan market. Mortar-wielding combatientes stop, question and search passersby. Stencil artists have set upon homes and businesses with spray cans to pour more scorn on their president. “Go to hell Daniel, you murderer,” is one recurring motif. Meanwhile, perhaps 50 police officers are said to be pinned down inside a local station.“We have no more law,” said Father Edwin Román, a local priest whose church, San Miguel, has found itself at the eye of this rapidly intensifying storm.Before the uprising, Father Román’s picturesque white church was a simple 40-minute drive from Managua. To reach it now, visitors must now sprint down a kind of sniper alley, down which demonstrators and church members claim security forces have been firing at demonstrators and civilians. “Be careful,” one masked rebel warned as he prepared to make a dash for cover. “They don’t care what nationality you are. They’ll shoot you right here,” he added, pointing to his forehead with his right hand and then using it again to suggest the resultant exit wound on the back of his skull. The conflict has transformed Román’s parish home into an unofficial field hospital. A statue of the Virgin Mary keeps watch over an improvised two-bed emergency room located next to what was once his sitting room. A volunteer force of medical students, paramedics and rescue workers camp out on its tiled floor, waiting for their next call. “It’s a war zone,” said a 27-year-old fireman who is part of a team of “blue helmet” rescue workers responsible for collecting the dead and wounded from the streets and dragging them away for treatment or burial. Like many local residents, the fireman said he backed the protests: “It’s the only way of making the government hear our voice.”Nicaragua’s state-controlled media has blamed the mounting body count vaguely on “delinquents” and “criminal groups”. The foreign minister, Denis Moncada, recently alleged a rightwing “conspiracy” was under way designed to destroy Nicaragua’s international image and allow organised criminals to seize control.As he prepared for his latest day on the front line, Father Román dismissed the idea that those now controlling Masaya’s streets were “vandals”. “All walks of life – kids, young people, entire families – are supporting this,” he said. “I think it’s impossible for things to go back to the way things were before.”With no solution in sight, Father Román said he sought solace in the book of Isaiah. “He will swallow up death forever and the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken,” he said, before adding: “This is the situation that we are going through. Nicaragua is crying. The mothers are crying ... I too have cried.”“I consider this to be like birth pangs. There is blood the blood of the young people, the tears of the mothers. But it will not be in vain,” the priest insisted. “It will be the fertilizer for freedom.”Additional reporting by Juan Diego Briceño"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f3df8a59aade9939ce3407ba6e185946db2e1e8/0_77_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=968a200ea4d7402ba907b08929662848","title":"argentina museum egomaniacs imf marcos pena","story":"Cabinet chief Marcos Peña warns against lure of populism during visit to London as government faces economic headwindsArgentina “is a museum of egomaniacs who said they were saviours of the country and failed one by one” the country’s cabinet chief said on a visit to London, as he insisted that his government’s appeal to the IMF to fend off a currency crisis will not affect the country’s growth.Marcos Peña said the centre-right government of Mauricio Macro will reach a deal with the IMF that will accelerate existing plans to cut the fiscal deficit next year.But Macri is facing growing discontent at home after failing to deliver on his campaign promise to kickstart the economy with massive foreign investments, and observers wonder if his administration might not eventually end up on Argentina’s roll call of failed saviours.Macri’s government has been praised internationally for its efforts to stabilise Argentina’s economy but has faced widespread protests at home over its austerity policies.Meanwhile, huge home utility hikes are wearing the patience of Argentina’s middle class thin and have made a mockery of his campaign promise of “zero poverty”.Market turbulence across a range of emerging economies was largely prompted by investors’ flight to the dollar in anticipation of high US interest rates.Peña said the shock underlined the degree to which the Argentinian economy is exposed to external events. He said: “That exposure is a rule for everyone today, but we are very conscious of vulnerability to external events. We are living in an accelerated time of globalisation. We think it is going to be exponential in the next decades, but we are positive about that. “No one can guarantee stability at a time of such deep change. As a country we have a PhD in volatility. We have now got to get a PhD in institution building and relying on our own strengths.”Although the IMF is deeply unpopular in Argentina – where it played a central role in the 2001 financial collapse after insisting on harsh austerity measures – Peña said the current return to the Fund was not comparable since “there is a synchronisation” about how to address Argentina’s problems – including the need to cut the fiscal deficit faster than planned next year.Peña said that any bailout package will be compatible with growth and poverty reduction targets.He said: “We do not intend for one second to blame our problems on the IMF or anyone else, if what is proposed is good for our economy.”But he denied the turn to the IMF was unpopular, saying only an ideological minority opposed what was a preventive measure.Neverthless observers now forecast tougher than expected elections in October next year. Large anti-IMF protests in Buenos Aires last month, and political resistance to cuts in energy subsidies, could be harbingers of future trouble.But Peña said one of Macri’s main tasks was to normalise a country after too much turbulence and volatility, claiming that the administration was putting an end to a culture of power that depended on saviour figures and populism.Peña was in London to meet British cabinet ministers, evaluate the chances of a bilateral Mercosur-UK trade deal after Brexit, and set out Argentina’s agenda for the G20 summit in Buenos Aires in November.Peña, who also laid a wreath in honour of all the soldiers who fell in the Falklands conflict, said that differences over the islands need not sour relations and trade between the two countries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/854bd753bb75eb45c3e64ebc73c1cccb0b0ed61d/0_124_3604_2163/master/3604.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7abdec30d94443a333941ef0876c87a","title":"canada marijuana party legalisation future","story":"Like Ukip after Brexit, the Marijuana party won the very battle it was established to fight. But its leaders insist the resistance continues against ‘prohibition 2.0’When Blair Longley considers Canada’s looming plans to reform its marijuana laws, it is with a degree of trepidation.He is not among those who worry about the impact of drugged driving or the risks for mental health, however. Since 2004, Longley has led Canada’s Marijuana party – whose raison d’être is now complicated by the fact that the country is poised to become the first G7 member state to fully legalise the drug.Now he fears that – like the UK Independence Party after the Brexit vote – his party may struggled to find a purpose after winning the very battle it was established to fight.“It will just get harder and harder for us to survive,” said Longley. “A lot of people will think: ‘What are you doing? It’s already legal.’”The federal government has said that legal recreational marijuana could become a reality in Canada by late August of this year, making Canada the second country in the world to legalise the drug, after Uruguay. Medical marijuana is already legal in Canada.Longley has little doubt, however, that his party would continue to exist, seeking political opportunity in the way legalisation is rolled out. “In every possible way, what they’re doing is nothing like anything that we campaigned for,” he said. “There’s this slight bit of progress, but when you look at the bigger picture, it’s nothing close to what we would want.”New rules being rushed out across the country mean that once legalisation is in place, some will find it easier to obtain and use marijuana than others, he said. In Nova Scotia, landlords were recently granted permission to ban cannabis use and cultivation on their properties, while Calgary’s city council has passed a bylaw prohibiting pot consumption in public.“Legalisation is great if you’re rich and old and have your own house and can afford to buy expensive marijuana,” said Longley. “But if you’re still young and poor and don’t own your own house, it’s worse than it was before.”Calling the government’s approach “prohibition 2.0”, he pointed to the limit of four marijuana plants per household. “You can brew as much beer and wine at home as you want, there’s no limit. You can grow 15kg of tobacco. So where does four plants come from?”The proposed legislation also includes tough penalties for those who fall afoul of the laws, such as prison sentences of up to 14 years for providing marijuana to a minor or selling marijuana without a license. Others are concerned that the manner in which the legislation is being crafted – often restricting retail sales to government-run monopolies – favours large producers and leaves little room for smaller players to carve out niches for themselves. The Marijuana party has always pushed to have an existing sector – recent federal data estimated that nearly five million Canadians bought marijuana last year – brought into the legal economy, said Marc-Boris St-Maurice, who founded the party in 2000. “If these massive barriers stay in place, there’s going to be no incentive for people to join the legitimate industry.”The seeds were first planted in the early 1990s after a defence lawyer brushed off St-Maurice’s questions about organising demonstrations on the issue.“He was like: ‘You want to change the law, get elected and change the law,’” said St-Maurice, who since 1999 has run a medical marijuana dispensary in Montreal. “Little did he know that his comments would have such an effect on me.”After launching a provincial party in Quebec, he then set his sights on expanding nationally.“At first, people laughed but then quickly realised that it was a serious matter,” said St-Maurice. “Everyone wanted to make jokes about smoking pot and this and that and I would have none of it.” Determined to capitalise on the momentum, St-Maurice resigned and joined the Liberal party in 2004. He has since lobbied the federal party from the inside as an active member. He hesitated when asked whether – given the looming plans for legalisation – the Marijuana party would have a role to play on the political stage in the coming years. “I’m not going to speak ill of the party that I founded,” he said. “I just wonder where the Marijuana party is today in the public discourse. I don’t see them as a huge engine for driving opinion and debate on this.” That diagnosis will be put to the test come January, as Longley and others begin canvassing for the 250 members needed to retain the Marijuana party’s status as an official party. It is a routine exercise demanded of all political parties in Canada, but Longley worries the task may be almost impossible after legalisation.“The glory days of the Marijuana party were back from 2000 to 2003,” he said. With a sigh, he added: “But I expect that we’ll continue to do what we’ve always done, just a token resistance – pun intended. That’s about all that we can do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7fc09921ee388e23f8ecd15928a32311a44e0eb/0_251_4147_2488/master/4147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b0ffe800e0a173eb0aa99df4d706555","title":"fresh free and beautiful the rise of urban gardening","story":"How an urban farms project in Dallas and a fellowship garden in Connecticut are helping their communitiesby  Rachel Obordo and   readersHow an urban farms project in Dallas and a fellowship garden in Connecticut are helping their communitiesby  Rachel Obordo and   readersIn Dallas, Texas, in an area designated as a food desert, meaning access to fresh fruit and vegetables is difficult, Big Tex urban farms have donated 85,000 servings of fruit and vegetables to the community since 2016.Developed for and funded by the annual Texas state fair, the project consists of mobile beds in car parks and a hydroponic greenhouse which allow plants to grow without soil. “The majority of the population in this area relies on small corner stores that do not provide access to quality produce or healthy foods,” said Jason Hays, the fair’s creative director. “Access to modern grocery stores can be inhibited due to pricing, transportation and education. The city tried to lure a large grocer with financial incentives but had no luck. “Access to fresh food options can have a profound effect on the health and wellbeing of iniduals, which can transform communities. I believe everyone should have equal access to healthy options as well as education to improve eating habits.”One recipient, Glenda Cunningham, of the Baylor Scott and White health and wellness centre, praised the project’s work. “The community looks forward to the Big Tex urban farm delivery each week. The food is fresh, free and beautiful,” she said.In Orange, Connecticut, the food production company Watson’s fellowship garden has been running for four years. The company grows produce for food banks and had extra space available, so it decided to expand and has opened its garden to a centre helping children with autism spectrum issues. Christina Cole, 47, a graphic designer at Watson, said: “The plot for Milestones Behavioural Services, which includes a pumpkin and melon patch, gives kids with autism and developmental disabilities the chance to not only have fun and be outside, but also learn life skills and take home what they grow and learn to cook with their families. With the garden season kicking in, we’re getting ready to put in a corn maze.”According to the Connecticut food bank, one in eight people in the state struggle with hunger. “We feel no one should have to think about where their next meal is coming from,” Cole said.The company provides 4,800 plants each year, and those not used are donated to the food bank for use in its gardens. Watson hopes the garden will not only help children but also address food insecurity facing older generations. “Those who are elderly and on a low income used to get vouchers from the state to access fresh fruit and vegetables, but the programme has been cut due to a lack of funding. With our garden we hope to work with the community and help with such issues. Everyone should have access to food, much less something fresh,” Cole said.She said shops were willing to donate food in West Haven but did not have the resources to do so. “I’m in the process of trying to organise the logistics of starting runners to help businesses get food to those who need it most. We’re hoping it will help reduce food waste in the area.” Rose Majestic, the executive director of Wheat, which provides food to people in crisis, said: “The people who comes to us can’t afford fresh produce so Watson’s weekly deliveries go a long way in helping them. We hope other businesses that have yards that can be dug up and used for feeding the hungry in our community start to do the same.”Watson is hosting an event in June to try to get local businesses to start their own community food-growing projects. “In light of the world nowadays, we should all get back to learning to grow our own food. It is the essential basis for survival. It can only further us all to know how to feed ourselves healthily and it’s a great help to have an alternative food source for our neighbours.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Approval ratings for their main rival, the current Liberal premier, Kathleen Wynne, had tumbled to the lowest in Canada as residents grappled with rising inequality, stagnating incomes and economic uncertainty. Months before the election, the Conservatives found themselves in turmoil after their leader, Patrick Brown, accused of sexual misconduct, resigned. Doug Ford, the brother of Rob, threw his hat in the ring, surprising many when he emerged victorious as Ontario’s new Conservative leader.A businessman who rails against the elite and regularly peppers his speeches and interviews with boasts and falsehoods, Ford soon began drawing comparisons to Donald Trump, prompting questions as to whether the isive wedge politics that have swept countries around the world had landed in Canada. Ford came with the baggage of being his brother’s most aggressive defender, lashing out at Toronto police and journalists as Rob fended off allegations of smoking crack.Doug was also plagued by his own set of drug-related allegations in 2013, the Globe and Mail reported that he had sold hashish for several years in the 1980s. Ford has denied the claims. Pointing to the multimillion dollar label company he had inherited from his father, he touted his business acumen and vowed to erect a neon sign at the US border reading “Ontario is open for business”.But the Conservatives’ commanding lead eroded as Ford refused to detail how his promises would be funded – simply saying he would find “efficiencies” across the government – and amid calculations that suggest his tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the province’s wealthiest.His advisers – many of whom worked for the former prime minister Stephen Harper – responded by clamping down on media access to Ford, limiting questions at press conferences and denying most interview requests.Polls suggested that some voters turned away, instead looking to the New Democrats, led by Andrea Horwath, and their pledges to drastically expand universal healthcare, reduce childcare costs and replace student loans with grants. Just days before the vote, Ford family drama roared into the headlines, as the widow and children of Rob Ford filed a C$16.5m lawsuit in a Toronto court. Rob, who served as Toronto’s mayor from 2010 to 2014, died in March 2016 after a battle with cancer. The lawsuit accused Doug Ford of being a “negligent” business manager whose decisions had steadily chipped away at the value of the company the Ford brothers had inherited from their father, Deco labels. Along with alleging losses of C$5m in the past seven years, the lawsuit claims that Doug, along with his other brother, Randy, do not have “the education and business ability to justify their employment as senior officers of Deco”, noting that the two also “failed” to retain competent management or appropriate business advisors to assist them. The allegations have not been proven in court. “Those claims are false and without merit,” Ford told reporters on Tuesday. “And it will be very clear when we prove that in court.” His political opponents jumped on the lawsuit. “Doug Ford has promised to run the province like a business,” the NDP noted in a statement. “But if he can’t run his own business properly, how can he be trusted to run the province?” The Liberal leader Kathleen Wynne described the lawsuit as distressing. “It’s distressing because this is the kind of thing we will get daily from Doug Ford as premier. Chaos and confusion. It’s not what Ontario needs,” she wrote on social media.

Conte heads a populist coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League that, according to its programme, sees Russia not as “a military threat” or “enemy” of Europe but as a “potential partner”.He promised his administration would “promote a revising of the sanctions” imposed by the EU on Russia after it annexed Crimea and destabilised Ukraine.A few hours earlier, Putin got much the same message in Vienna, on the first state visit of his fourth term. Russia was “a part of Europe”, said Austria’s president Alexander Van der Bellen, denying Moscow faced “a crisis of trust” with the west.Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, who heads a coalition of his conservative Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), told a press conference he hoped the sanctions could be “relaxed step by step”.The FPÖ leader, Heinz-Christian Strache – now also Austrian vice-chancellor – went further, telling local media that Europe must “end these sanctions … and normalise political and economic relations with Russia”. EU–Russian relations have been badly strained by Russia’s role in conflicts in Crimea, Ukraine and Syria, as well as by accusations of interference in several European elections and, most recently, the Skripal affair.But Putin, apparently now eager to build bridges, has recently begun signalling a clear desire to re-engage with Europe. Russia “does not aim to ide the EU”, he assured Austrian broadcaster ORF ahead of his Vienna visit.“We want to see a united and prosperous EU, because the EU is our biggest trade and economic partner. The more problems there are within the EU, the greater the risks and uncertainties for us.”Those words may ring hollow in many European capitals, which – unlike both Vienna and Rome – responded favourably to Britain’s request to expel Russian diplomats in the wake of the Salisbury attack. But not in Italy and Austria, where the FPÖ and the League, both now junior coalition partners, signed ill-defined “cooperation accords” with Putin’s party last year based on a shared belief in nation-first politics and a mistrust of international alliances.Matteo Salvini, the League leader, has denied borrowing Russian money to fund his election campaigns, as Marine Le Pen of France’s far-right Front National has had no qualms doing. But Salvini has often expressed his admiration for Putin and said last month he wanted “to work for peace, not war”.Austria’s Strache, meanwhile, besides calling frequently for EU sanctions to be lifted, has forcefully criticised Nato’s expansion eastwards, arguing it “wasn’t Russia who, in recent decades, has been the aggressor”.It is too early to say what the consequences – if any – of this isolated outbreak of goodwill towards Moscow might be, for the sanctions or Russia-EU relations in general. Kurz was at pains to reassure his EU partners that Austria’s loyalty is of course to Brussels, not Moscow. But Putin will not be unhappy.

But there are real reasons to be concerned. The quality of teaching is under strain in Irish third level. Over the past decade, student numbers in many colleges have risen by more than 20 per cent.However, staff numbers have remained static due to Government-imposed recruitment restrictions. This has led to overcrowded classes, reduced access to practicals and less support for inidual students. This shows up in student-teacher ratios, a key metric used in international rankings. Take the case of UCD. A decade ago, the university ranked in the top-100 (86th place) for student-teacher ratios. Following employment restrictions and reduced State funding, it has plummeted to 536th place globally.Last year, UCD’s president warned that it may have to reduce Irish student numbers to tackle this problem. This could limit supply at a time when student numbers are rising, sending CAO points even higher still.It is clear, then, that either drastic measures or extra funding will be needed if we really are serious about – to quote the Government’s favourite phrase – creating the best education and training system in Europe. But it’s hard to see where funding will come from. Hard-pressed families and students are already paying the second-highest fees in Europe.The prospect of an income-contingent student loan scheme – which could allow for further increases – is off the agenda after the Government recently opted to kick this can down the road.The private sector, meanwhile, has grumbled over being forced to contribute extra to higher education through increases to the National Training Fund.This leaves the public sector. The Government says it has invested more than €100 million this year compared to 2016. The reality, however, is that this money is simply keeping most universities standing still.Funding per inidual student has nudged upwards only slightly because most extra money has gone to paying for public sector pay increases.If there is to be a surge in investment, it is hard to see where it will come from given competing demands on the public purse.One potential answer is to boost university autonomy and relax Government restrictions. Most universities now generate the bulk of their income privately. It is questionable whether the Government should wield such authority within a sector when it is becoming a minority investor.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

File photograph: Eric LukeThe mapping of DNA from some of the settlers who colonised Iceland more than 1,000 years ago offers an insight into the fate of thousands of slaves – mostly women – who were taken by Norse Vikings from Ireland and Scotland before they put down roots on the North Atlantic island.Anthropologist Sunna Ebenesersdóttir, of the University of Iceland and the company deCODE Genetics in Reykjavik, analysed the genomes of 25 ancient Icelanders whose skeletal remains were found in burial sites across the island. Sequencing using samples from teeth revealed the settlers had a roughly even split of Norse (from what are today Norway and Sweden) and Gaelic ancestry. It is the first in-depth investigation of how a new population is formed through a genetic process known as “admixture”.When the researchers compared the ancient genomes to those of modern people in Iceland and other European countries, they found contemporary Icelanders, on average, draw about 70 per cent of their genes from Norse ancestry. This suggests that in the 1,100 years between settlement and today, the population underwent a surprisingly quick genetic shift in favour of Norse genes, the researchers report in the journal Science.They confirm that while the ancient settlers, “mainly Norse men and Gaelic women”, are genetically indistinguishable from present-day Irish, Scots and Scandinavians, present-day Icelanders have over the course of 1,000 years, and numerous population bottlenecks, become a distinct new population. “Repeated famines and epidemics led to a substantial loss of sequence ersity from the Icelandic gene pool, causing it to drift away from its source populations in Scandinavia and the British-Irish Isles,” explained Kári Stefánsson, deCODE chief executive and co-author on the paper. Another possibility, he suggested, is that ancient Icelanders with more Norse ancestry held a slight edge in reproductive success over those with Gaelic ancestry, many of whom were enslaved when they came to the island.The Celts were often buried in unmarked graves though, intriguingly, a minority were buried in the traditional Viking way, with their sword and boat.On the study, he added: “This is a fascinating example of how a population is shaped by its environment, in this case the harsh and marginal conditions of medieval Iceland. “It is also another demonstration of how our small but well characterised population can continue to make important contributions to understanding the fundamental genetic and evolutionary processes that shape our species.”Their next step is to expand sample size, and to examine how diseases affected the population.

Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeBloombergSix months after Theresa May agreed to a backstop arrangement to prevent a hard border, and three weeks ahead of a crucial EU summit, she is planning to publish her proposal for the backstop on Thursday. As so often during the Brexit negotiations, however, she must first clear the hurdle of her own ministers in a cabinet subcommittee amid snarling from Brexiteers on her own backbenches.Downing Street on Wednesday insisted that the backstop will be time-limited, a key Brexiteer demand, but the prime minister has promised Brussels that the backstop will remain in place “unless and until” another solution for the Border is found. These two commitments are clearly contradictory and Brexiteers fear – probably correctly – that the backstop will only end when the EU agrees that it should.The EU’s proposed language on the backstop earlier this year envisaged it as an arrangement specific to Northern Ireland, which would remain aligned with the customs union and parts of the single market until another agreed solution to keep the Border open is found. Britain’s proposal is expected to call for the backstop to be applied to the whole of the UK, so that no new regulatory barriers are erected between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.EU negotiators reject the idea of a UK-wide backstop on the grounds that it amounts to cherry-picking parts of the single market without accepting the full responsibilities of membership. This special arrangement, Brussels says, can be extended to Northern Ireland because of its special circumstances but will not be available to the whole of the UK.For their part, Brexiteers fear that, unless Britain can unilaterally place a time limit on the backstop, the country will remain indefinitely in the customs union and subject to EU single market rules it will have no part in shaping. They argue that, with Britain in the customs union and subject to EU regulations for goods, the EU will have little incentive to agree a comprehensive trade deal to cover services, where Britain enjoys a trade surplus with the EU.As she faces the possibility of defeat next week on amendments to the EU withdrawal Bill at the hands of Conservative Remainers, May has succeeded in disappointing her own backbenchers on both sides of the Brexit debate. At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the benches behind her were filled with row after row of despondent faces, Brexiteers and Remainers united in their lack of enthusiasm for their leader.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3521668.1528311984!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk cabinet divided as brexit backstop plan due","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s secretary for departing the EU, David Davis. Photograph: Leon NealPool via Reuters The British government is expected to publish a proposal on Thursday for the backstop to avoid a hard border amid cabinet isions over whether it should have a time limit. Brexit secretary David Davis said the proposal still had to be signed off by a cabinet subcommittee before it could be presented to EU negotiators in Brussels.“The detail of this is being discussed at the moment. It has been through one cabinet committee, it is going to another one, and it would be improper of me to pre-empt the negotiation there. But I suspect it will be fairly decisive,” he said.Mr Davis said the backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland aligned with the EU customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit, would be time-limited.“I think the prime minister has already made public the fact that we expect to put a time limit on the backstop proposal,” he said.Earlier, a Downing Street spokesman said that the backstop was necessary to fulfil the commitments the British government made to avoid a hard border in Ireland, although all sides hoped another solution would be found.“It’s important that that is time-limited, even outside of the fact that we don’t expect or want it to happen,” the spokesman said.Before the last EU summit in March, Britain and the EU agreed that the backstop should remain in place “unless and until” another solution to keep the Border open is found and Downing Street said on Wednesday that it did not “resile” from any commitments it had made.The EU has told Britain that talks on their future trade and security relationship cannot proceed unless there is “sufficient progress” on a legally binding withdrawal agreement, which includes the Border backstop, when EU leaders meet at the end of this month. Mr Davis said on Wednesday, however, that the issue of Northern Ireland was unlikely to hold up progress.“We’re not expecting the Northern Ireland elements of this arrangement until October so I wouldn’t expect any time issue to stop progress between June and October,” he said.Fine Gael Senator and spokesman on EU affairs Neale Richmond on Wednesday night described this month’s summit as “a vital staging point in the Brexit negotiations” ahead of a meeting in October, when the negotiations are expected to be concluded.“Given the ever-looming conclusion of the Brexit negotiations, it is maddening that the British government has yet to present any detailed proposals to bring about a legal interpretation of December’s binding, political agreement,” he told a conference in London organised by the centre-right Wilfred Martens Centre. “At this stage, I say enough of the Brexit kite-flying it is time for real proposals.“The speeches given by the prime minister up to this point have been warm and made all the right noises, but they have not addressed the key issues in any sort of detail and they have not used the necessary technical language it’s been all rhetoric.”\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Peter Stringfellow dies aged 77: \u0026#39King of Clubs\u0026#39 loses cancer battleThe economics of Love Island: how game theory explains \u0026#39coupling up\u0026#39Why Singapore turned to the Gurkhas to protect Trump-Kim summitGrenfell: The First 24 Hours review – a hard-to-watch film that only served to reinforce the sense of outrage  Mary Wilson, widow of former Labour prime minister Harold, dies aged 102Murder arrest as churchgoer aged 100 dies after \u0026#39horrific\u0026#39 street robberyF-35: The fighter jet of the future touches down on British soil Love Island 2018: From contestants to recoupling, a beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new seriesKate Spade\u0026#39s husband opens up about designer\u0026#39s depression after suspected suicideLondon hotel fire: Guests flee as blaze hits exclusive Hyde Park Mandarin Oriental hotelArizona police in violent assault on unarmed manTrump commutes Alice Johnson\u0026#39s sentence after lobbying by Kim KardashianKim Jong-un \u0026#39got on hands and knees and begged for Trump summit\u0026#39, Rudy Giuliani saysRamadan 2018: Why Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranBilderberg group: The secret meeting of minds with Osborne, Rudd and Kissinger on this year\u0026#39s guest listWhat is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

Previous studies have suggested a lack of time outdoors, exposed to natural light, is a major factor, and working on things close to you is another element.To address this, schools in Asia have begun using daylight simulating “bright lights” in classrooms.However, the authors say it has yet to be proven that these classrooms “provide any protection against myopia” or mimic natural light.“The best recommendation, based on the highest quality available evidence at the moment, is for children to spend more time outside,” they conclude.Professor Ewan Birney, director of the European Bioinformatics Institute, said this showed the powerful insight genetic work can give.“It is not absolutely definitive evidence for a causal link – which ideally should also have a mechanistic explanation – but it is strong evidence,” he added.“In response, we need to remember that East Asian education systems have played a major role in producing the current epidemic of myopia and high myopia, and that these systems will require substantial change to help protect the vision of future generations.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

BASF\u0026nbspfor example, was able to\u0026nbspsuccessfully isolate\u0026nbspof genes from marine microbes responsible for omega 3 production.Known as the substances in fish oil responsible for an array of beneficial health effects, omega 3 actually finds its way into fish due to its presence in microorganisms and plankton that they eat.After isolating the relevant genes, BASF scientists were able to splice them into rapeseed, so they could produce canola oil from the plants that contains omega 3.“It’s almost like science fiction,” said Dr Blasiak.\u0026nbsp“As I understand it, there is a push to have this fortified canola oil on the market for human consumption by 2020.”A spokesperson from BASF\u0026nbspsaid the vast majority of marine genetic sequences included in patent applications by the corporation are from publicly available databases, and noted that publicly known sequences cannot be protected by patents.BASF has applied for patents to a large extent for special self-developed use-cases in which these sequences are used. Examples of such applications are increasing the yield of crop plants.The desire to take advantage of the sea’s precious resources is understandable, and by 2025 the global market for marine biotechnology is expected to reach $6.4bn (£4.8bn).However, as there is currently no Nagoya Protocol to protect the vast areas beyond national jurisdiction there is a danger that marine resources will be disproportionately exploited by isolated actors.Countries that have taken part in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) have committed to promoting marine technology for the benefit of all parties concerned on an equitable basis.As 27 of the 30 countries that have patented marine genes are parties to UNCLOS, the researchers suggested this should drive greater equity and fairness in the distribution of these resources.Equity is deeply embedded within UNCLOS and the language of the sustainable development goals, said Dr Colette Wabnitz, a marine scientist at the University of British Columbia and co-author on the study.\u0026nbspAs it stands, there is no obligation for companies like BASF to disclose the provenance of their genetic material, making it difficult to tackle these issues.International negotiations on a new UN treaty are set to begin in September that will cover conservation and sustainable use of bioersity in areas of the sea not covered by the Nagoya Protocol.Ensuring that the process moves forward in an inclusive manner means that states should increase their commitments to disclose the geographic origin of marine genetic resources, and promote greater international participation in discovering and using the benefits of marine bioersity,” said Dr Wabnitz.According to the scientists, this also means the handful of companies with disproportionate influence must be involved in these negotitations.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“Everything should be done, for instance, to try to get representatives of BASF to contribute their expertise to this process,” said Dr Blasiak.“They are clearly leaders in this landscape of actors and have substantial knowledge to draw on that can help the negotiations move forward in a practical manner.”The BASF\u0026nbspspokesperson said: The sustainable use of resources including marine resources is very important to BASF and we are fully supportive of the aims of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Nagoya Protocol and UNCLOS.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

You can ask anybody who lives in the tropics – this doesn\u0027t hold true for our planet.This effect is thought to result from differences in heat distribution across the two planets.\u0026nbspWarm, moist air rising from Earth’s\u0026nbspequator fuels thunderstorms around the planet’s middle, whereas the same effect on Jupiter is created by warm gases from Jupiter\u0027s interior rising at the poles due to their lack of atmospheric stability.These discoveries could only happen with Juno, said Dr Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno from the Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio.\u0026nbspOur unique orbit allows our spacecraft to fly closer to Jupiter than any other spacecraft in history, so the signal strength of what the planet is radiating out is a thousand times stronger.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

While 24 per cent of the former gained entry, only 12 per cent of the latter did.“You see places as prestigious as Oxford with an exclusionary admissions strategy,” Rev Sharpton told The Independent.“Oxford can figure out the most difficult aspects of philosophy and explore the intricacies of science but\u0026nbspcan’t figure out how to get admissions of black students. It seems contradictory – how could you be so bright and so dumb at the same time?”“Ninety-five\u0026nbspper cent of the crowd was white. I told them they need to work with groups like Operation Black Vote, who I have been coming to the UK with since 1991.”Operation Black Vote is a non-partisan, non-profit national organisation that was established in 1996 to tackle the black British and ethnic minority democratic deficit. It centres its energies on voter registration, lobbying politicians and mentoring schemes.“In Oxford, out of 29 colleges, eight colleges did not have one black undergrad admitted between 2015 and 2017,” Rev Sharpton, who Mr Obama described as “the voice of the voiceless and a champion for the downtrodden”, said.\u0026nbsp“Last night I said that we have the great symbolic heartwarming picture of a person of colour marrying into the royal family which we all support, but you have the undercurrent of exclusion in places like Oxford.”While about 3\u0026nbspper cent of the British population is black, according to the most recent census, only 1.9 per cent of the roughly 3,200 students admitted to Oxford in 2017 identified as black Britons.Oxford University – which has been contacted for comment –\u0026nbspadmitted it needed\u0026nbspto do more to improve student ersity after the latest figures were unearthed last month.Samina Khan, Oxford University’s director of undergraduate admissions, said the university was working hard to change.“The reason for that is that you are looking a very different applicant pools. One is very large – that is the white pool in terms of who gets three As and above (at a A-level) – and the other one is very small,” she told the Today programme.“We are not getting the right number of black people with the talent to apply to us and that is why we are pushing very hard on our outreach activity to make sure we make them feel welcome and they realise Oxford is for them.”David Lammy, Labour MP and the former higher education minister, said: “The truth is that Oxford is still a bastion of white middle-class southern privilege. That is what it is.“They have to explain why you are twice as likely to get in if you are white as if you are black and why you are more likely to get in if you are from the south than the north of England when you apply.”Earlier this year, The Independent revealed black students pursuing a place at university were 21 times more likely to have their applications investigated for suspected false or missing information than their white counterparts.\u0026nbspUcas said it was “extremely concerned” by the figures, released under freedom of information rules, and had launched an investigation.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Turkish police dispersing a march in Istanbul with tear gas and rubber bullets in 2015 and banning the event in 2016 and 2017 outright on security grounds underlines\u0026nbspthe ongoing relevance of the demonstration.More recent reports of homophobic violence being carried out in Chechnya\u0026nbsp and Indonesia\u0026nbspfurther emphasise the need for education to encourage greater tolerance.This year\u0027s London Pride parade is scheduled for Saturday 7 July while the UK\u0027s largest event\u0026nbsptakes place in Brighton on Saturday 4 August, coinciding with the Pride Festival held at Preston Park between 3 and 5 August, which is this year being headlined by the one and only\u0026nbspBritney Spears.Other key events taking place across Britain this summer include:In Europe, this summer\u0027s biggest Pride events are:Even further afield, you can celebrate Pride in these cities:or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Hippos are susceptible to the infection, and can pass it to humans who eat infected meat.\u0026nbspZambia\u0026nbspinitially suspended a planned cull in 2016 following pressure from activists, but Born Free\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspaccused\u0026nbspthe government of “secretly” overturning the decision and “promoting the cull to trophy hunters”.\u0026nbspWill Travers, chief executive of\u0026nbspthe charity, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe authorities have failed to provide enough\u0026nbspevidence showing\u0026nbspan overpopulation of hippos in the Luangwa River, or to make public any data that\u0026nbspjustifies\u0026nbspthe cull.They are, apparently, using the same flawed rationale for the slaughter as last time – a preventative measure to avoid a future outbreak of anthrax, combined with an assertion that low rainfall will exacerbate the situation, he said.They also appear not to have informed key stakeholders in the Luangwa Valley...\u0026nbspThe negative consequences for thousands of hippo and Zambia’s reputation as a wildlife tourism destination cannot be underestimated.”Umlilo Safaris, a South African trophy hunting company, last month began\u0026nbspoffering customers\u0026nbspa five-day “hippo management hunt” in the Laungwa Valley for £10,500 each.\u0026nbspThe organisation’s Facebook page says hunters can shoot five hippos per trip and keep the animals\u0027 tusks.Richard Kock, professor of wildlife health\u0026nbspat the Royal Veterinary College, told The Independent the government needed to provide\u0026nbspdata to justify the cull.\u0026nbsp“There’s no doubt that hippos can build up numbers until there really are probably too many for the ecosystem,” he said. “And so I think the anthrax may well be a factor in controlling their populations, and it may benefit the environment because they will consume large quantities of herbage, and obviously that will affect other species.\u0026nbsp“I’m also very sensitive to the fact people use these things as excuses for nefarious behaviour. So I would say you need good data and you need good evidence and it should be the scientific authorities who should back up any sort of criteria on culling. And it should be justified.”In a statement, Zambia\u0027s ministry of tourism said the culling was to maintain a suitable habitat for aquatic species and wildlife in general, noting that similar culls had taken place before.The hippos are causing considerable damage to the riverbanks and continue to threaten the sustainability of the river system, a spokesperson said.The move comes months after more than 100 hippos died from a suspected anthrax outbreak in Namibia.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Honolulu attorneys will review the measure before it goes to Mayor Kirk Caldwell, who would have 10 days to sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature or veto it.\u0026nbspUber sent emails to customers across the island of Oahu, which is where the rule would apply, urging them to oppose the rules that would impose outdated taxi-style requirements on rideshare.\u0026nbspOahu taxi drivers have been at odds with those who drive for mobile apps that connect riders with nearby drivers. Taxi companies complain that companies such as Uber and Lyft create an unfair playing field because they face fewer restrictions.\u0026nbspUber has been told the city hasn\u0027t received any consumer complaints about surge pricing, said Tabatha Chow, the company\u0027s senior operations manager for Hawaii. Honolulu has the highest taxi prices in the nation and Uber is 40 percent cheaper, she told council members Wednesday.\u0026nbspSurge pricing only happens during peak times such as rush hour, weekend nights and big events, she said, adding that fares go back down when more drivers are on the road.\u0026nbspIf Uber and Lyft rides are cheaper, then why do they need to use surge pricing, asked Robert Deluze, owner of Robert\u0027s Taxis, who said ride-hailing companies have hurt the taxi business.\u0026nbspCouncilwoman Kymberly Marcos Pine, who voted for the limits, said she was concerned to hear that U.S. Navy sailors getting off ships in Pearl Harbor recently were charged as much as $221 to get to Waikiki when a cab ride was $44. As the wife of a sailor, she said she wants to protect service members from being price gouged.\u0026nbspUber said in a fact sheet that surge pricing gives drivers the incentive to work in busier areas, which lowers wait times for riders and ensures reliability.\u0026nbspRiders and drivers who submitted testimony opposing the measure said taxis aren\u0027t as reliable or affordable as ride-hailing companies.\u0026nbspUber driver Lisa Gonzales wrote that she drives to help support her family of six. During surge pricing, passengers have the option to accept or reject costs, she said, and that it\u0027s based on supply and demand.\u0026nbspUber and Lyft officials testified in City Council committees last month that the cap on surge pricing would be the first such restriction on the companies in the country, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.\u0026nbspWhen demand for rides is greater than the number of drivers on the road, passengers may pay an extra percentage on top of the base ride amount, Lyft said in a statement explaining its Prime Time pricing.\u0026nbspA $6 ride would become a $9 ride during Prime Time pricing of 50 percent, the statement said, adding that it only adds a percentage to the ride subtotal, which is calculated before any other fees or additional amounts.\u0026nbspCouncil Chairman Ernie Martin said he wrote the measure to ensure consumers won\u0027t pay an unreasonable price. He said companies will still be able to employ surge pricing — or as he prefers to call it, predatory pricing — within limits.\u0026nbspThe measure would set precedence nationwide, he said: Other cities are struggling with this as well.\u0026nbspThe city\u0027s Department of Customer Services would be tasked with setting the maximum price. Deputy Director Randy Leong told council members that the department opposes setting the threshold but will do so if it becomes law. It\u0027s difficult to dictate to businesses what they may charge, he said.\u0026nbspUber released a statement after the vote saying that, if implemented, the bill will limit consumer choice and put the availability of Uber service on Oahu at risk.\u0026nbspor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It is unclear how many of them are exhibiting symptoms, but a State Department spokeswoman said on Wednesday evening that “a number of iniduals” had been sent to the United States for further testing.For months, US officials have been worried that their diplomats have been subjected to targeted attacks involving odd sounds, leading to symptoms similar to those “following concussion or minor traumatic brain injury,” the State Department says.The cases in China have broadened a medical mystery that started in 2016, when US Embassy employees and their family members began falling ill in Havana. In all, 24 of them were stricken with headaches, nausea, hearing loss, cognitive issues and other symptoms after saying they heard odd sounds. The issue has roiled relations with Cuba, which immediately fell under suspicion, and led the United States to expel Cuban diplomats.But with Americans now exhibiting similar symptoms in Guangzhou, US officials have raised suspicions about whether other countries, perhaps China or Russia, might be to blame.That is sure to complicate already strained relations with both countries over a variety of economic, political and security issues. Russia has been accused of meddling in the 2016 American presidential election, trade disputes have erupted with China and US officials fear that the Chinese are undermining relations with North Korea before a summit meeting with President Donald Trump planned for next week.The new illnesses in China come just weeks after US\u0026nbspofficials reported finding their first case here in Guangzhou, where a consulate employee got sick. Some American officials in this city live in apartment complexes filled with other foreigners and wealthy Chinese that is where the ailing employees were subjected to unusual noises.But it remains unclear whether the illnesses are the result of attacks at all. Other theories have included toxins, listening devices that accidentally emitted harmful sounds or even mass hysteria.The mystery spread to China this spring, when the first employee fell ill, and fears escalated last month when the government warned other employees to seek medical attention if they experienced unusual ailments. So far this week, another employee, his wife and their two children were evacuated after the parents exhibited neurological symptoms. Officials said they expected that at least some others would be flown out of the country as well.The illnesses appear more widespread than the State Department initially reported last month, when it said that one person had “reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure.”Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the symptoms of the first US employee in Guangzhou to report being ill “are very similar and entirely consistent with the medical indications that have taken place to Americans working in Cuba.”There are roughly 170 American diplomats or employees in Guangzhou, as well as their family members, and a senior US official said a sizeable number had undergone or would soon undergo testing by the State Department doctors who arrived on 31 May.The officials cautioned that no final determination had been made about what caused the illnesses.The latest American employee evacuated from Guangzhou is Mark A. Lenzi, a security engineering officer at the consulate. He left Wednesday evening with his wife and two children after having suffered in recent months from what he described in an interview as neurological symptoms. He said that his wife had similar symptoms and that they had heard unusual sounds in their apartment.On Tuesday, Mr Pompeo said in a statement that the symptoms in the first case discovered in Guangzhou were similar to the ones experienced by the 24 Americans who became ill in Havana. He said that the cause had not yet been established.The injuries in Cuba, like those in China, followed disturbing sensations of sounds and vibrations that have been described variously as the sounds made by cicadas, static, metal sheets waving or, in Mr Lenzi’s case, marbles rolling around a metal funnel.After the injuries were diagnosed in Cuba, the Trump administration expelled 15 Cuban diplomats, saying Cuban officials had failed to adequately to protect American diplomats. The Cuban government denied any involvement and questioned whether any “attacks” had taken place. US officials suggested it was too soon to consider such a response in China, though they have raised it with the Chinese government.On 23 May, the State Department disclosed that an employee stationed in China had complained of “subtle and vague, but abnormal sensations of sound and pressure” over several months from late 2017 until April. That employee, who was evacuated, was not identified.“We are not aware of any similar situations in China, either inside or outside of the diplomatic community,” the department said in the health alert. It advised others with “concerns about any symptoms or medical problems” to consult a doctor.The disclosure caused anxiety and anger among US government employees in China. Others have since come forward to report similar experiences or symptoms.In a statement on Wednesday evening, the State Department’s spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said that “a number of iniduals” had been sent to the United States for further testing and that the medical examinations continued in Guangzhou.Among those who reported symptoms was Mr Lenzi. In an email sent to the entire staff of the consulate, he complained that the first employee was evacuated in April, but that no one was told of the health concerns until a month later – after doctors in the United States had found evidence of brain trauma. The initial health alert, he said in an interview, suggested it was an isolated case. “They knew full well it wasn’t,” he said.The consulate itself, which opened in 2013, is a state-of-the-art building designed to withstand electronic eavesdropping and other security and intelligence threats. Instead, the ailing employees said they experienced the strange sounds and sensations in at least two apartment complexes where American government workers live, along with other foreigners and wealthy Chinese.In an interview before leaving China, Mr Lenzi said that he had lived in the same apartment tower as the officer evacuated in April. It is one of several high-rise buildings in The Canton Place, a modern complex built around a plaza and bordered by restaurants, cafes and galleries. Another diplomat who reported symptoms was at a different upscale building near the consulate.Lenzi said that over the past year he and his wife had experienced similar physical symptoms, including headaches, sleeplessness and nausea, and on three or four occasions they heard odd noises, though they did not put them together until the disclosures last month.Even if people are evacuated for further tests, that does not necessarily mean that they have suffered injuries or illnesses, the officials emphasised. Only 25 percent of those evacuated from Cuba, for example, were later found to have health problems.But the Chinese cases have raised alarms inside the State Department. Now led by Mr Pompeo, the department appears eager to avoid the criticism it faced over what some called its handling of the Cuba cases.In addition to the department’s medical team, William E. Todd, the acting director-general of the Foreign Service, and Michael T. Evanoff, the assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, flew to Guangzhou to assess the situation. Their visit was not announced in advance, and they were not made available to comment before departing on Wednesday.In Tuesday’s statement, Mr Pompeo said he had created a health care task force to examine “the unexplained health incidents that have affected a number of U.S. government personnel and family members stationed overseas.”The statement left open the possibility that there have been similar events at other US embassies or consulates. One US official said that he was aware of reports of isolated episodes, but that there did not appear to be any discernible pattern.Guangzhou is a major commercial hub of 14 million people on the Pearl River, about 75 miles north of Hong Kong. In addition to the embassy in Beijing and the consulates in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, the United States operates consulates in Chengdu, Shanghai, Shenyang and Wuhan.Mr Lenzi worked for the diplomatic security department, and he believes that his work could have made him a target. Before joining the Foreign Service in 2011, he worked with the International Republican Institute, funded by Congress, promoting democratic reforms in Ukraine and Georgia – two countries where Russia has denounced American involvement.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It said the government had triggered the Argentinian cancellation through its own actions.“Turning the game into a political event caused its cancellation,” Zuheir Bahloul, a member of the Knesset from the Zionist Union party and a former football commentator, told The Independent.In particular, the right-wing culture and sports minister, Miri Regev, had erred in moving the venue from the northern city of Haifa, which was Argentina’s preferred locale to Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its “eternal, unided” capital but whose eastern part Palestinians envision as their own future capital.The issue has become all the more charged since the US last month moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, infuriating Palestinians.Ms Regev also depicted the friendly as linked to the 70th\u0026nbspanniversary celebrations of Israeli statehood.“The moment the Argentinians saw that the game was taking on a political colouring they got cold feet,” Mr Bahloul said.“The result is that the fans, including myself, lost out on the visit of the prophet of the religion of football, a very special prophet\u0026nbspwho, with his team, did not make it to the holy land.”The Palestinian campaign was led by Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Football Association, who on Sunday called on Arab and Muslim fans to burn pictures and T-shirts of Messi if he attended the friendly.The Israeli government blamed antisemitic elements for the fiasco.Avigdor Lieberman, the hard-right defence minister, wrote on Twitter: “It is a shame that the football nobility from Argentina didn’t withstand the pressure of the inciters and haters of Israel whose only goal is to harm our basic right to self-defence and bring about the destruction of Israel. We will not surrender in the face of a group of antisemites and terror supporters.”Ms Regev blamed Argentina’s decision on “terror groups that began sending messages to players and their families with clear threats to harm their lives and those of their children. Among other things, films and pictures of children’s bodies were sent to the players.”Fans were ided over who to blame for the cancellation.“This happened because of the inappropriate politicisation by minister Miri Regev. We actually deserve this punishment for injecting politics too much into sports,” said pensioner Shmuel Einhar, an Israeli Arsenal fan.Matvey Barsukov, 42, a health worker, disagreed, saying:\u0026nbsp“Argentina should not have caved into the pressure of BDS. Sports, music and culture should bring nations together. Argentina made a mistake and it’s a shame.”Palestinians were elated by Argentina’s move.PLO Secretary General Saeb Erekat said Argentina, its people and team had upheld international law in the face of Israeli violations including killings of innocent Palestinians along the Gaza border.The Argentinian decision “means the world doesn’t surrender to state terrorism, robbery and threats that are implemented by the Israeli government and backed by US President Donald Trump.“The international community won’t surrender to the actions of the Israeli government and its crimes against the Palestinian people.”Israel says its use of force against Palestinian demonstrators is necessary to prevent a penetration of its border that would endanger nearby communities.Fadi Quran, Ramallah-based senior campaigner for the Avaaz online activist network, said: “Argentina’s decision has brought a spark of hope to millions of Palestinians who felt forgotten.“From Palestine we say thank you Argentina for taking a moral stance and reminding the world that Palestinian lives matter.”Mr Quran dismissed Israeli assertions that Argentina’s move came about because of threats to players, saying Avaaz had worked closely with BDS and encouraged 200,000 members in Argentina and Spain to send messages to the Argentinian Football Federation demanding withdrawal from the match.“We got the message to them that they were being played by the Israeli government and they bravely took the right position.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

is braced for the most intensive sessions so far.And he raised the stakes in the negotiations yesterday by venting frustration at the EU\u0027s refusal to accept Britain\u0027s unconditional offer of a continuing close security partnership once the country has quit the bloc.Mr\u0026nbspDavis insisted that current cooperation\u0026nbspworked\u0026nbspwell in helping European nations pick up on suspicious\u0026nbspbehaviour and share\u0026nbspdetails\u0026nbspof potential terrorist attacks.As the\u0026nbspthreats\u0026nbspwe face continue to evolve so must our collaboration, the EU Exit Secretary said.Because we must work together \u0026mdash and quickly \u0026mdash if we want to avoid any gap in our operational capability, a gap that could be exploited, putting people in

BrusselsMr\u0026nbspDavis also raised concerns about threats to freeze the UK out of the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), which allows the sharing of tens of thousands of pieces of information about criminal convictions between EU nations every year.We are consistently one of the top three contributors and users of ECRIS.\u0026nbsp Last year alone, we sent and received more than 600 requests and notifications a day, the EU Exit Secretary said.If we were frozen out of ECRIS, neither the United Kingdom nor member states would be able to quickly obtain criminal records information from each other.Courts might no longer be able to take into account previous convictions when deciding on guilt, sentence or bail.And law enforcement agencies may no longer be able to protect the public when dangerous iniduals move between the United Kingdom and the European Union.Mr\u0026nbspDavis also feared the UK\u0026nbspdefence\u0026nbspindustry was facing\u0026nbspdiscrimmination\u0026nbspin the awarding of contracts from the new European Defence Fund.The UK and our industry are already making a meaningful contribution.But, the EU\u0026rsquos approach to the provisional regulation risks damaging potential cooperation in the longer term, he said.On all of these, unhelpful precedents and assumptions on how third countries should cooperate with the EU\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphindering projects that help the entire continent.Dogmatic responses based on what has happened before don\u0026rsquot help anyone.In a warning of retaliation, the senior Tory added: And actually, when I hear that by going beyond precedent for the UK, agreements with other countries will have to be re-examined.Mr\u0026nbspDavis said Britain could be proud of its role in defending peace and security on the continent and was determined to continue to do so.We\u0026rsquore proud of the role that we have played in making our continent safer. We have taken such actions because we are friends and allies of the European\u0026nbspUnion,\u0026nbspand its member states. Europe\u0026rsquos security is our security, he said.We want a comprehensive deep partnership with the European Union on a whole range of matters, that have an impact on our security.Ahead of next week\u0027s talks, he urged the European Commission to accept Britain\u0027s departure and\u0026nbsprecognise\u0026nbspthat Brexit did not mean the country was turning inward and away from Europe.I\u0026nbsprecognise\u0026nbspthat Brexit isn\u0026rsquot popular for many people in the EU.Going around Europe, it\u0026rsquos clear that people do not want us to leave.

The scores were to be given to a newborn one minute after birth, and additional scores could be given in five-minute increments to guide treatment if the newborn\u0027s condition did not sufficiently improve.Severe medical problems in her family led her to develop an interest in science and medicine.Her older brother died from tuberculosis and another suffered from a prolonged chronic illness.When she graduated in 1925 she knew she wanted to become a doctor and completed a residency at P\u0026ampS in 1937.The doctor was the first woman to become a professor at the prestigious Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeon in 1949.The American anesthesiologist would have been celebrating her 109th birthdayDr Apgar was persuaded to go into anesthesiology by P\u0026ampS Chairman Dr Allen Whipple.Whipple felt the scientific discipline needed advancing and she had the \u0026ldquoenergy and ability to help it.The Apgar score is a way of measuring the health of a baby right after birth and is still used in many hospitals in the US today.She gave thousands of babies scores during the 1950s as the rate of infant mortality in the US began to climb.By the 1960s the technique was the main shorthand for recording a child\u0026rsquos health.Severe medical problems in her family led her to develop an interest in science The doctor travelled widely and gave lectures across the US.Virginia also published over 60 scientific articles and became well-known in the study of birth defects \u0026ndash teratology.She also co-wrote the 1972 book Is My Baby All Right? which explained the causes and treatment of common birth defects.The doctor was given three honorary doctorates during her career rom the Women\u0027s Medical College of Pennsylvania, Mount Holyoke College and the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry.But she maintained a variety of interests throughout her busy career.These included fishing, stamp collecting and flying lessons in her fifties.She never married and died of cirrhosis of the liver on August 7, 1974."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nintchdbpict000278857477.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"national living wage uk 2018 increase minimum wage 16 18 25 year old","story":"But the amount is still below the Real Living Wage, a voluntary scheme to which thousands of employers including retailers, local authorities and charities have got involved.The National Living Wage is the amount of money all employees aged over 25 are legally entitled to.It used to be known as the National Minimum Wage, but it was re-branded in 2016.The National Living Wage increased from £7.50 to £7.83 for those aged 25 and over.The 33 pence-an-hour rise was introduced on Sunday April 1, 2018.The compulsory National Living Wage was introduced in 2016.The first National Minimum Wage was set in 1998 by the Labour government.Mr Hammond is aiming to get the wage to £9 by 2020.The National Minimum Wage is the amount which workers aged under 25, but of school-leaving age, are entitled to.However, the amount differs depending on age and whether the worker is on an apprenticeship scheme.Workers aged 21-24 were paid £7.05 - and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know. Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

Imagine how fast Tory fortunes, shored up by Leave voters, will nose-dive if Brexit is fatally wounded.Remainers already blame them for holding the referendum. Leavers will blame them for negating 17.4million votes.There is only one solution. Tory Remainers must put aside their personal views and respect the manifesto promises they stood on last year.When Home Secretary Sajid Javid says it will cost lives, he’s not exaggerating. He’s pointing out the reality of Brussels turning its back on the peerless UK ­security services it relies so heavily on.EU bureaucrats plainly consider a few more terrorist victims mere collateral damage in their zeal to punish us.This is the truth behind the “happy, inclusive” EU of Remainer fantasies.It is a hard-nosed trading cabal, run mafia-style by unelected bullies treating voters as cannon fodder.IT would be an act of national self-harm for MPs to reject a third Heathrow runway.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is poised to give it the nod, possibly today.

The legal limit for a pilot is 20mg.Monaghan today appeared at Crawley Magistrates Court to plead guilty to the reporting for duty as a pilot when his level of alcohol was over the prescribed limit.Emlyn Jones, defending, said his client drank the booze well in advance of the eight-hour alcohol rule - known as bottle to throttle.Mr Jones told the court: He was not due to take up his responsibilities as pilot of the plane on take-off.He would not have been charged with taking up the role of pilot until three- and-a-half hours into the flight.Mr Jones told the court Monaghan had been on a overnight flight as a passenger the night before, and had spent the day without food or sleep.He added: He turned up for work appalled, astonished and horrified that he was still over the limit.Mr Jones said his client was only a fraction over the drink-drive limit of 80mg per 100ml of blood, and that Monaghan was not falling over drunk and no harm was caused.This was rejected by chair of the bench Dr David Wiggins, who said: I have to say the comparison to drink-driving is somewhat spurious in these circumstances.A pilot in a Boeing 777 is somewhat different from driving on the road, so we are completely ignoring that comment.Asking for the court to consider sentencing Monaghan on Wednesday, Mr Jones, said: He has thrown away the only career he has ever known.He has been a pilot his whole life, and that has gone.Sending the case to crown court, Dr Wiggins told the ex-pilot: I think you need to prepare yourself there is a very, very high chance that it will be an immediate custodial sentence.The 12-hour flight, from Gatwick to Mauritius, was scheduled to leave at 8.20pm, but the plane was left waiting at the gate while airline staff looked for a third pilot.Monaghan is due to be sentenced at Lewes Crown Court on June 12.A spokeswoman for British Airways said: This behaviour is completely unacceptable and not what we expect from our highly professional fleet of pilots.The safety and security of our customers and colleagues is always our top priority."},{"url":null,"title":"water company foul mouthed letter customers apology","story":"Wessex Water customers were left baffled by the foul-mouthed line in the letter explaining upcoming roadworks.In between advice on what to do you regarding the disruption, a rogue line in bold read: Tom Wysocki is a t**t.The company have since said sorry over the inappropriate language.One Twitter user posted the full letter, writing: May I congratulate Tom Wysocki for mentioned in dispatches.Alana received an apology from the Bath-based firm, but added: I feel sorry for Tom.Alana later tweeted “looks like Tom has upset someone”.She tagged a different Tom Wysocki in her tweet who took it all in good humour.He posted: “I am pretty sure it is not me either.”A spokesman for Wessex Water said: A letter about water supply work was tampered with and contained some inappropriate language.Weve taken the matter extremely seriously and were taking steps to make sure it doesnt happen again."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411454383.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may david davis brexit split","story":"David Davis’s open revolt against the PM came after she refused his demand to define a precise time limit for a backstop solution to keep the Irish border open.Rumours swept Westminster that Mr Davis was on the verge of resignation, after months of bitter duelling with the PM’s chief Brexit advisor Olly Robbins.But the 69-year-old ex-SAS reservist told friends last night he will stay and fight the “people trying to box me in”.The ugly row sent Brexit tensions in the Cabinet to boiling point, with one senior figure saying it’s “never been as bad as this.”Senior Leave-backing ministers reluctantly agreed that the UK would stay closely aligned to the Customs Union if no other solution to the Irish dilemma could be agreed with the EU.But while Mrs May wants it to be only a temporary solution she will not pin down an end date, while Mr Davis insists the backstop only lasts until 2022.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson joined the bitter revolt yesterday to also demand No10 answer a series of questions.He wants to allay fears the UK is being tricked into a Hotel California-style Brexit of never actually leaving Brussels’ control.A high stakes showdown now beckons today, after Mr Davis insisted the decision go to a full meeting of the PM’s 11-strong Brexit war committee at 12.30pm this afternoon.While No10 insisted the backstop proposal – dubbed a Temporary Customs Arrangement – had been agreed by the committee already, Mr Davis said instead: “The detail of this is being discussed at the moment.“It’s for a Cabinet committee to decide on that, and if they conclude then you will see it tomorrow. But it’s up to them to decide.”On whether he will walk out of the Cabinet, the Brexit Secretary added: “That’s a question I think for the Prime Minister”.But Mrs May was said to have already despatched the proposal’s blueprint to Brussels to be presented to EU negotiators today.Hitting back at Mr Davis, a senior No10 source said: “We have to put something to Brussels that is negotiable, not something that will be thrown out by them immediately.“If we don’t, our Remain backbenchers next week will take it as their excuse to vote the lot of it down.”In another act of defiance, it also emerged last night that Mr Davis refused to present the backstop plan today when it is published, leaving No10 forced to approach other minister to do the PR job.Mr Davis had been scheduled to publish the plans for the backstop on Thursday but it is now likely to be launched by Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, instead.The PM also faced embarrassment in PMQs yesterday when she was unable to tell Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn when the government’s full white paper on Brexit will be published.Mr Davis is also locked in a bitter row with Mrs May after she delayed publication of the blueprint until next month, after a crucial EU summit on June 28.And she was harangued during the tense Commons session by angry Tory backbenchers, including MP Henry Smith who demanded: “Please can we have some delivery”.A former Tory leader also told Mrs May she must issue an ultimatum to the EU to press on with trade talks immediately or Britain will prepare to walk away.Leading Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith has issued his gravest warning yet that time is running out fast to cut a good Brexit deal, with just nine months to go before the UK’s exit.Heaping blame on Brussels negotiators for dictating the slow pace, Mr Duncan Smith called for Mrs May to enforce “a change to the way we are negotiating”.He added: “I think we have to arrive at the June council and say we have to do trade now and if we don’t, and if you don’t want to start the trade discussions, then we really have to say we are planning and will continue to plan to leave without a deal”.The former Tory boss also admitted there may be massive queues at Dover if a good deal is not struck, and ministers must urgently start preparing for the potential chaos there too.Labour’s Shadow Brexit Minister added: “It hardly instils confidence in the Government’s approach to Brexit when it’s supposed key negotiator is openly talking about resigning.“David Davis should stop worrying about his own job and start taking action to protect the jobs of the British people.”No10 was also accused of showing the backstop blueprints to Remain fans like Chancellor Philip Hammond over the weekend while Leavers such as BoJo and Michael Gove only got them yesterday, The Times reported.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some new road laws have already come into place, with more set to change the way we look after our vehicles later this year. We\u0027ve joined forces with the experts at Halfords to round up the essential bits of information all drivers need to know. So read on to stay up to date with the latest updates to British laws with this essential guide.  1. Learners can use the motorway now   For the first time learner drivers are allowed to take lessons on the motorway. Instructors must be properly licensed and have dual controls. This law should help learners become better prepared for driving on high speed roads - making our motorways safer. This follows a change in December which saw using a sat nav form part of the driving test. This was partly introduced because around a quarter of accidents involving new drivers are caused by them being distracted trying while using one. Tip: For added peace of mind, fit a dashcam. While they won\u0027t prevent an accident, investing in one can offer peace of mind. Having one means that if something were to happen, you\u0027d have video evidence to back up your version of events. Because of this, they can even be used to lower your insurance premium. The Garmin 55 Dash Cam, above, is excellent, can wirelessly send footage to your phone and has amazing, better-than-HD quality video and superb low-light performance. 2. Your diesel must be clean  The quest to clean up diesel continues as MOTs are expanded to check particulate filters. If your car produces any visible smoke during the MOT then it will fail. Similarly if your particulate filter has been tampered with then you will also fail. Make sure your diesel is running well and as cleanly as possible before your test. Tip: Some diesel problems are complicated, but make sure your car has the right oil levels and is using the correct oil. Use the Halfords Oil Finder to pick the right oil for your car - or pop in to your local Halfords store for advice from their expert staff. You can also check the Halfords MOT Advice or book an MOT at a Halfords Autocentre.  3. There are penalties for driving in the wrong motorway lane   Smart motorways have lanes which can be opened and closed via electronic signs on the overhead gantry. This allows for better traffic flow during peak times by using the hard shoulder for additional capacity. If, however, you ignore the signs when a lane is closed you will be liable for a fixed penalty of \u0026pound100 and three points. On many motorways you\u0027ll be automatically photographed if you break this rule and you\u0027ll get a fine as well as notice of penalty points in the post. Tip: A sat nav won\u0027t help with smart motorways, but they can alert you to possible traffic delays and reroute you. And with lifetime map updates, the Garmin Drive, above, is a great way to navigate.  4. Low tyre pressure is now an MOT fail  Before you go to your MOT make sure you\u0027ve checked your tyre pressures are correct. MOT testers are on the lookout for tyres that are underinflated and aside from that it\u0027s important for safety to make sure your tyres are correctly inflated.  Tip: Make sure you have a tyre pressure checker at home so you can keep an eye on your tyres. A footpump or electric pump is a great way to keep tyres at the right pressure. 5. It\u0027s very easy to fail an MOT for a broken car bulb - get a Free Car Check to make sure they\u0027re working As many as 30 per cent of MOT fails are because of lighting or signalling problems. So make sure your horn works and walk around the car checking all the lights – make sure the car is parked safely and the handbrake is on first, or you can reverse up against a wall to check brake and reverse lights.  Tip: Halfords FREE Car Check will ensure your car bulbs are all working as they should. The check also includes:  Wiper Blades Check Car Bulb Check Battery Check Engine Oil Check Windscreen Chip Check Plus a FREE Screenwash Top Up  Just pop in to a store or book online now. 6. Headlight washers are crucial now  It might seem odd, but if your car has headlight washers fitted, and was registered after September 2009, then they must work. Tip: Halfords will top up your screen wash for free as part of the Free Car Check. The MOT also requires your wipers be fully working, and Halfords can check those too. There’s more info on wiper blades here.  7. In three years you\u0027ll need working daytime lights "},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist air horn fed up","story":"News\"Self righteous\" cyclist fed up with pedestrians walking on bike paths blows AIR HORN at them - until it backfires dramaticallyReactions to the video have been mixed with some viewers claiming the bike rider overstepped the mark\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNeil Murphy03:52, 7 JUN 2018Updated07:20, 7 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA cyclist tired of dodging pedestrians who had wandered into bike lanes on his daily commute used an AIR HORN to shock them out of his way. His antics were filmed as he attached a camera to his helmet and recorded their startled reactions across London, shocking passersby and even making one woman spill her coffee. A group of several young men are given a huge fright as they wandered into a bike lane while other offending pedestrians are given similar shocks across locations in central London. The approach has had a decidedly mixed response - with one man strolling in a cycle lane lashing out and striking the lycra-clad vigilante in anger.  The rider is believed to have used a Fire Chief air horn, which manufacturers say can reach up to 120 decibels – roughly similar to the noise of a jet taking off. Reckless Bradley, who uploaded the video, wrote on YouTube : “I am fed up with people walking in the cycle lane in London. Its like they don\u0027t even care that is there. I decided to make my presence more known by investing in an air horn. These are my results.” "},{"url":null,"title":"im dying love you teenage","story":"News\u0027I\u0027m dying, I love you\u0027: Teenage race hate attack victim\u0027s heartbreaking call to parents as he lay bleeding in streetWARNING - GRAPHIC IMAGES: Matthew Hayden was mown down and hit over the head with a golf club - ending his promising rugby career just a day after being accepted onto a sports scholarship in the US\u0026nbspShareByDamon WilkinsonKelly-Ann Mills20:17, 6 JUN 2018Updated07:22, 7 JUN 2018News (Image: MEN MEDIA)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe teenage victim of what police believe to be a brutal race hate attack called his parents to say ‘I’m dying, I love you’ as he lay seriously injured in the street. Matthew Hayden was mown down and hit over the head with a golf club in a brutal unprovoked attack. With a fractured skull and a bleed on the brain, the scared 17-year-old called his parents, thinking it could be his last ever phone call. Matthew’s parents, who asked not to be named, have now made an emotional appeal for information and revealed more details about the shocking incident which took place in Rochdale, Greater Manchester in the early hours of Saturday. They have also released photographs of Matthew after the attack. His mum and dad told the Manchester Evening News that after Matthew was hit with the golf club, the driver of the car - a Nissan Micra - tried to run him over a second time.  Despite his injuries, he managed to roll away into a driveway. Matthew’s parents thanked ‘brave’ nurses from a nearby care home who they believe saved their son’s life by giving him first aid. Matthew’s mum said: “We got the call that every parent never wants to get. “Matthew rang us saying he was dying. He said ‘I love you, but I’m going’, then his phone cut off and we didn’t even know where he was.” A black Nissan Micra rammed into the back of a Vauxhall Corsa, in which Matthew was a passenger, at a roundabout. When Matthew, a prop forward who plays for Littleborough RUFC, got out of the Corsa, he was hit by the Micra, flipping him over the bonnet and roof. He was then attacked with a nine iron golf club.  Matthew’s friend and fellow rugby player Josh Jones, 18, who was driving the Corsa, suffered injuries to his hand and his face when another one of the offenders smashed the car window with a metal object, believed to be a crowbar. Another friend, Zac Madden, who was also a passenger in the car, managed to escape unharmed. Police, who are treating the incident as a hate crime, said that during the attack the group of four or five Asian males hurled racial abuse at Matthew and his friends. The day before the attack, Matthew, an engineering apprentice, learned he had been accepted on a four-year rugby scholarship at a American university. He won’t be able to accept the offer following the attack - and he may never play rugby again. Matthew’s dad said: “He had promising rugby career in front of him and they have taken his hopes and dreams away from him. “They have ruined a young man’s life for mindless violence. “Matthew is just so frustrated. He knows what they have done. He told us ‘they’ve ruined my life’.  “After the call cut out a nurse called us back. “We got to him as quickly as we could and it was just horrendous. There was blood everywhere. “There were three nurses looking after him, giving him first aid. They were very brave, we owe them so much.” Matthew underwent an emergency four-hour operation on Saturday at Salford Royal Hospital.

He’s lost the feeling in the left side of his face. His speech is slurred. He’s having to drink through a straw. “We don’t know how long he’s going to be in hospital for or what the long-term is going to be like.” His mum added: “Matthew is the most caring and kind person you could ever want to meet. “He is such a lovely lad. He cannot understand why someone would do this to anyone. “I’m trying to stay positive because I cannot accept he’s not going to make a full recovery and Matthew has to believe the same.” His parents also pleaded for anyone with information about the attack to come forward.

Umar Malik lost 12 stone after becoming ashamed and upset with how he looked. He had always struggled with his weight but when he turned 18, he began guzzling 70 slices of toast and 56 eggs every week and within three years he had gained 10 stone. The 26-year-old became so big that after hitting 28st his scales could no longer measure his weight. Umar, who wore a size 6XL at his biggest, knew he needed to make a change in 2014, when his shower floor could no longer hold his weight and began leaking water into his kitchen.  However, he didn’t fully commit to losing weight until 2015 when he began attending a gym every day and started eating a strict diet of 3,000 calories a day. By November 2017, the personal trainer, who now helps others through their weight loss journey, had dropped down to 16st 2lbs and completed an unbelievable body transformation. Umar, from Ealing, in West London, said: “I remember standing in front of a mirror and feeling ashamed of how I looked. I knew I needed to make a change. “I had no body confidence. I was so big that the scales couldn’t measure me anymore. It was my lowest moment. It was just not healthy. “My family were really supportive but they didn’t really know what to do. I would love to go back and be there for myself because now I know what I needed. “Growing up in a typical Asian family, it was generally seen that if you ate a lot then you were the good kid and if you didn’t then there was something wrong with you. “I think that’s where it all started but I have always had a big appetite and enjoyed food. I was out of control but I didn’t want to commit to losing weight. “When I was growing up I couldn’t find clothes that would fit me and I had to wear my dad’s clothes. My weight would stop me from going out and socialising.”  Despite his size, from being a teenager, Umar visited a gym regularly for strength training but used it as a way to isolate himself and take out his frustrations. Umar said: “I went into my own shell and I was on my own a lot which was very unhealthy physically, mentally and emotionally. This didn’t change until I lost weight.” Umar’s ballooning waistline was caused by a huge daily intake of food but he now eats a calculated diet of six small meals a day and as well as strength training now also does cardio. Ultimate Performance, where Umar now works, has the world’s leading personal trainers and they have also worked with celebrities such as Gemma Atkinson, Scott Mills and Ryan Thomas. Umar said: “There was no way I wouldn’t see a result as long as I continued eating a strict diet and exercising regularly. It was always going to happen. I felt really good about it. “I wanted to be really strong and I achieved that goal. I now fuel my body so it is ready to work. I know what works for my body and what is best for me. “I am much more confident now and I love going out socialising and meeting new people.” BEFORE Breakfast – 10 pieces of toast, 8 eggs, chicken breast, beans, tomatoes and sweetcorn. Lunch - Post workout shake made of full-fat milk, oats, almonds and whey protein.  Dinner – Three servings of rice and chicken.  Drinks – Five pints of fizzy drinks.  Snacks – Crisps, chocolate and apple pie. 7,000 calories a day. AFTER  Through the day eats six small meals containing either chicken and vegetables, salmon, steak, prawns, soup and rice.  3,000 calories a day."},{"url":null,"title":"mi6 double agent al qaeda","story":"NewsMI6 double agent in Al-Qaeda reveals how he foiled terror plots and rubbed shoulders with 9/11 mastermindAimen Dean was MI6\u0027s top Al-Qaeda spy and worked as a bomb-maker for the regime\u0027s chemical weapons programme\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHeather McNeill23:40, 6 JUN 2018Updated23:42, 6 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn MI6 double agent who once foiled a planned chemical attack on the New York Subway says he believes the war on terror is far from over. Aimen Dean was a top spy for the UK intelligence agency during the war on terror. While undercover, he became one of Al Qaeda\u0027s most respected bomb-makers, swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden and rubbed shoulders with the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks. He worked on the regime\u0027s chemical weapons programme and foiled attacks on civilians, saving countless lives while risking his own.  In an interview with Channel 4 News promoting his new memoir, Nine Lives: My time as MI6\u0027s top spy inside Al-Qaeda , Mr Dean said he was not worried about revenge attacks against him following the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in March.   The difference (between Skripal and I) is that he is pursued by one of the great powers of the world, and many of my former comrades are either dead or in prison. I take precautions. I’m not overly worried, but I take precautions to make sure that I don’t end up somewhere where there is a heavy concentration of my ex-associates. While working as a double-agent, Mr Dean said he reported back to the UK on locations of Al-Qaeda camps, the regime\u0027s new training methods and associates and its weapons of mass destruction program. Despite meeting one of the men who would go on to become one of the 9/11 hijackers, Mr Dean said the terrorist attack could not have been prevented with the intelligence MI6 had at the time. If you wanted to stop 9/11, you have to have at least 12 spies inside Al-Qaeda and each one inside one of the different departments. Only then you could have stopped it.  I don’t know (how many spies MI6 had) to be honest, but I will be surprised if there are more than two or three. Speaking of his coups during his work as a double agent, Mr Dean said he helped prevent a chemical attack on the New York Subway. There was a plot to attack the New York Subway with chemical weapons, a chemical device it was invented during my time actually, in that specialist lab in Afghanistan. And I was reporting on it regularly to the UK secret services. Although his work helped prevent some terrorist attacks, the former spy believed the war on terror would continue for years.

Anthony Hirst, 48, was arrested after the foul-mouthed post went viral and disgusted social media users complained to Merseyside Police, a court heard. Alfie, from Liverpool, died aged 23 months of a degenerative brain disease after parents Tom Evans and Kate James fought a high-profile campaign over his end-of-life care.  Hirst\u0027s disturbing message on Facebook said: F Alfie the scouce little c  Let him die. That be 97 then after the hillsbourgh 96. One less Scouse to worry about bin licking gob****s.(SIC)  The message, which included three smiley face emojis, was sent to one person but was then widely shared. It has provoked such outrage that Hirst has had to flee his home.  The jobless ex-bakery worker, from Burnley, Lancashire, yesterday admitted sending a grossly offensive message when he appeared at the town’s magistrates’ court. Hirst, whose own four-month-old daughter died in 2010, told detectives during an interview that he couldn’t explain why he’d sent the message, the court heard. He was responding to a text he’d received expressing sympathy for little Alfie\u0027s plight together with an image of a candle, days before his death on April 28, the court was told. When questioned by police, Hirst said he was depressed, the court heard.  He told a probation officer he sent the middle-of-the night reply without thinking, and then went back to sleep. Hirst received threats after the message was made public and had to move home, the court heard. When police spoke to the defendant, he said he had deleted the message and Facebook account. Prosecutor Tracy Yates added: He said he was depressed and not in the right frame of mind. He couldn\u0027t explain any reason why he sent that message. Cathryn Fell, defending, said Hirst responded completely inappropriately, to the message sent to him. She added: He sent a message to one person. He has not put it on a public platform. Unfortunately, they have thereafter shared it with others and that\u0027s why it\u0027s effectively mushroomed.  Miss Fell said: He says \u0027I know it was wrong. It was stupid. I can\u0027t explain it. I\u0027m sorry for what happened\u0027. The solicitor said Hirst had since had to move out of his home because of threats. She went on: He\u0027s fully appreciated the effect it\u0027s had on people and it\u0027s affected him back. A probation officer who interviewed the defendant said he had lost both his parents within the last couple of years and lost a child in 2010. She told the court: He has been diagnosed with depression recently by his GP and has been medicated. His GP has referred him for some grief counselling.

Cherelle Farrugia, from Cardiff, is thought to be one of just 35 people affected by the condition worldwide and says it has turned her life in to a “nightmare”.  She must make sure someone is in the house with her when she showers as she\u0027s been warned she could go into anaphylactic shock, Wales Online reports.  Cherelle gave birth to her daughter Willow in November 2017 but six weeks on she developed a painful rash every time she had a shower. It took doctors three months to diagnose her with aquagenic urticaria, a rare condition which leads to hives developing rapidly after the skin comes into contact with water.  As a result the Cardiff and Vale College student is unable to take her daughter swimming. There is currently no cure for the severe allergy but medics believe it is linked to changes in Cherelle’s hormones after giving birth to Willow. “About six weeks after having my daughter I realised that every time I got out of the shower my skin would be really itchy,” she said. “I initially thought it must be caused by the soap I was using. Then I thought it was the temperature of the water. “But I tried all different temperatures – cold, hot, lukewarm and body temperature – but my body reacted to all of them.”  Cherelle, who lives in Fairwater, also crossed chlorine allergy and bacteria in the shower head off her list of possible causes. “I was still reacting to everything but I didn’t think it could possibly be a water allergy. I’d never heard of such a thing. “The first doctor I saw told me it was impossible but the second doctor I saw had heard of it and referred me to an allergist.  “The waiting list on the NHS was five months so I decided to go private.”   Cherelle, who is training to become a mental health councillor, said she developed postpartum depression after the birth of Willow which is likely to have triggered the allergy. “It was horrific and it hit me out of nowhere. I was borderline suicidal,” she said. “I couldn’t get out of bed, I couldn’t leave the house, and I was convinced something was going to happen to my daughter. I wouldn’t get anyone hold her. “But I am very fortunate to be super close to my mum and dad and my partner is amazing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"people noticed something alarming cinderellas","story":"NewsPeople have noticed something alarming about Cinderella\u0027s appearance - but it actually makes senseThe Disney Princess has been given a make-over for the new Wreck-It Ralph film - with one bizarre tweak\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor09:24, 7 JUN 2018NewsCan you spot it?

Somehow, the loss of both her parents and a life of servitude, drudgery and maltreatment didn\u0027t dim her youthful glow.  But even doe-eyed Disney princesses with improbably teeny waists aren\u0027t free from imperfections - and the perpetually perky Cinderella has her flaws.  The new Wreck-It Ralph movie is being released later this year, and some new characters have been unveiled, including a 3D version of Cinderella. As well as apparently getting a feminist make-over, the updated Cinderella also looks different, thanks to one simple tweak. Her ears.  She used to have NO EARS.    In the 1950 classic, we see her in her sparkly blue ballgown with her hair swept up, but no ears. Even when she\u0027s in her rags, her ears aren\u0027t exactly well-defined. One eagle-eyed fan pointed out the difference on Twitter, and others were quick to express their astonishment at having never noticed.         As for why her ears slowly disappear over the course of the film, there was one interesting theory.

It’s the theatre of dreams for a lifelong Manchester United fan and Olly will be playing alongside legend Phil Neville in Robbie Williams’ England side while taking on Reds idols Eric Cantona and Jaap Stam in Usain Bolt’s World XI. But it’s two young soccer stars 7,000 miles away in Africa who will be giving Olly his pre-match goosebumps – teenagers Vincent and Veronica. The singer and TV presenter has just returned from an emotional and eye-opening trip to the slums of Nairobi, Kenya, where he learned how the game has transformed the lives of them and hundreds of others.  Olly, 34, went to see the Unicef-run Acakoro Football Academy, which helps desperately poor boys and girls aged seven to 18 with education, food and clothing, as well as soccer training. He heard how it saved Vincent, 13, and Veronica, 15, from a miserable, terrifying existence \u0026shyscavenging to survive on a rubbish tip. But he was unprepared for the horrific experience of returning with them to the dump that was their home for more than two years.  Olly explained: “It was awful – disgusting and truly shocking. The smell, the sight, the noise hits you first, like nothing you’ve ever experienced. “But then comes the \u0026shyrealisation that this is ‘home’ to thousands of vulnerable children. “What upset me more than anything was hearing that Vincent was just seven years old when he ran away from home to fend for himself at the dump. “He didn’t have a choice – his mum had other younger children and she couldn’t feed him. But he was seven – the same age as my nephew, Louie.  “That really hit home – imagining Louie out there all alone in that dreadful place.” Doting uncle Olly shook his head sadly as he looked at pictures of Vincent nervously showing him around the tip where he endured months of hell. He went on: “Vincent, bless him, was really worried and scared about going back to that place, but he wanted to help us, because Unicef helped him. “You can tell he has been deeply affected by the trauma he went through at such a young age. “Vincent explained how he’d rummage through the filthy litter for plastic, metal or anything he could sell for a few pennies. And he was eating bits of rotting food he found in the piles of waste – anything to survive.  “Vincent lived on that dump site for two years. He showed me how he used to burrow into the mounds of rubbish at night and put himself inside plastic bags to hide from all the gangs. He was so young, the older guys picked on him and forced him to do things. “They’d nick from him, they’d beat him up. He’s even got a mark on his face where they cut him. We also met Veronica, who was a bit older, but she lived there for two years as well. “She said she was one of the lucky ones as she had older friends who looked after her. But other young females would get abused, physically and sexually. “Just imagine it – the constant fear they must live with. Imagine seven-year-old kids sleeping in plastic bags on a dumping site at night. It’s just crazy.”  But Olly saw there is hope – thanks to projects like Acakoro, which was set up with some of the \u0026pound24million Soccer Aid has raised for Unicef in the past decade. He said: “It was amazing to see for myself what Soccer Aid and Unicef are doing for these kids. At Acakoro they get daily football coaching, but also a hot meal and a shower – a real luxury in the slums. They also get a football kit, other clothes, help with access to education and tuition for those struggling.  “School supplies, such as books and backpacks, are provided too. “It gives them somewhere to go, it keeps them off the streets away from gangs and thieving or getting themselves into trouble. The staff, the coaches, are incredible and really look after everyone. It’s amazing.” After visiting the rubbish dump with Vincent and Veronica, Olly enjoyed a game of soccer with them and other academy kids. And the X Factor winner, who co-owns and plays for Essex team \u0026shyCoggeshall Town FC, was impressed with their skills – especially Vincent’s.  Olly said: “It was difficult talking to Vincent at first, because he isn’t that chatty – he has gone through a lot of trauma. But he loves his football. He gets there early every day and he plays in goal now. “I said, ‘Right Vincent. Me and you in a penalty shoot out – we’ll do five, so how many are you going to save?’ “He smiled at me and said ‘all of them’. It was a lovely moment because it was the first time I’d seen him smile in two days there. He did save them all, too. It proved to me football truly does bring people together. And everyone can help Unicef open more places like Acakoro by donating to Soccer Aid on Sunday.

A proposal by the country’s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has suggested a registration system be introduced to severely curtail access to pornography websites. Under this system, telecommunication companies would be forced to cut off access to x-rated sites unless customers choose to opt in. Politicians say access to porn is too easy and claimed that uncontrolled consumption is akin to taking drugs. Currently, over 50 percent of Polish internet users access free porn at home and while at work.  Piotr Uscinski, an MP for the country’s ruling party, said that pornography “works on the brains of its consumers and leads to drastic “personality changes”. He said: Pornography is a threat to public health because it leads to a pandemic of porn addiction. The government also argues that adult content is too easy for young people to watch.  Research from the Integrated Prevention Institute shows that in Poland, 60 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls are first exposed to porn at the age of 11. PiS MP Arkadiusz Mularczyk said: We should civilise and limit this sphere of life because we can not allow demoralisation. Today, the law is too liberal in this respect. Poland\u0027s Law and Justice party has faced repeated criticism over its ultra-conservative approach to many social issues.

extensively restored.So when Maurice said he was looking to sell it, David decided it was time to bring it back home again and he bought it October 7, 2011.The Kingsmuir couple now take it along to different shows with the club, of which David is now on the committee of while the couple share the duty of newsletter editor.The club was great as it accepted all different types of classic cars which suits the couple, who also have a 2001 Jaguar XJ8 Executive and a 1961 Hillman Minx 1500cc among their collection.\u0026#8220What you\u0026#8217ve said you like about it is there\u0026#8217s a big variety of vehicles,\u0026#8221 Maureen said to David.\u0026#8220When you go to a one make club you only talk about that one make of vehicle,\u0026#8221 David said.\u0026#8220I find it more interesting than a one make club.\u0026#8220You usually find someone who\u0026#8217s had that problem or knows someone so if you\u0026#8217re stuck for hint you can find someone.\u0026#8221David grew up in Kirriemuir, but said his father was originally from Cornwall and he had traced his roots back to Central Europe.\u0026#8220I went and did one of those DNA test,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220The results come back that I\u0026#8217m actually from around Germany and France\u0026#8220I kind of suspected that because I used to give blood and my blood group was European, but I\u0026#8217ve always lived in Scotland.\u0026#8221Maureen said they were quite well placed as they could visit the classic car shows both north and south of them.\u0026#8220Because people don\u0026#8217t tend to to travel long distance, when you go up Fraserburgh you tend to see a lot different vehicles up there than what you do here and the same when you go down south, you\u0026#8217ll see something different,\u0026#8221 she said.The couple are both preparing for the 13th Tayside Classic Motor Show, which is being held at Errol Airfield on Sunday, June 10, which they have been involved with for the last 12 years.\u0026#8220We\u0026#8217re hoping mother nature will be kind to us this year,\u0026#8221 Maureen said, after the event was called off last year due to rain.The show, which has donated £47,000 to various causes over the last 12 years, will display more than 600 vehicles have this year ranging from a 1927 Austin 7 to the more modern classics including a wide range of cars,

have the best playing surface in the Championship.Since manager Csaba Laszlo was appointed in November, he’s stressed the need for a pristine pitch to match the passing style he wants from the Tangerines.And while last season the surface was the envy of most of their second-tier rivals, the board have stumped up five figures to make sure it’s even better next term and beyond.They announced this week the existing turf has been lifted and a process known as vertical sand-banding started.While that’s a complicated, as well as expensive, process, the new and improved pitch will be ready when the first of the Betfred Cup group matches kick off there in as little as six weeks.The work being carried out will also improve drainage – something that has been a problem, particularly in the area near the tunnel at the Eddie Thompson Stand end of Tannadice.And, while most of the budget for the next 12 months is going on putting together a squad capable of winning promotion, chairman Mike

He’ll seem like a new signing if he can rediscover the form that helped Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs gain promotion to the top flight.Verdict: Looking good up top.Overall: With just 18 first-team players on the books, work is obviously still to be done but initial signs look promising. Adding solid defenders, however, is vital.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b672067ab.jpg ","title":"sams new community foodbank in dundee staves off hunger for 160 folk in two months","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new community foodbank has helped prevent 160 local people going hungry in just two months.Food for Thought – a food and clothing bank – launched at the end of April at its base in Charleston Library.The scheme, which is headed by Sam Bruce, was set up in a bid to tackle food poverty among those who do not qualify for referral to services in the city such as traditional foodbanks.People who have come through the organisation’s doors include single parents, unemployed people whose partners work or those who have fallen on hard times.Sam said she was inspired to start up the food and clothing bank by similar schemes around the country.She said: “I was part of a money saving group and I saw that places in England and in Edinburgh were doing something similar.“I run a playgroup and there were people telling me they knew of others who were really struggling.“I was listening to folk who were saying they didn’t qualify for any support from foodbanks – maybe because their husband works or because they have a part-time job – and I thought the idea would definitely benefit people in that position.”The way the organisation works is by offering weekly memberships instead of charging for the produce – with people becoming a member for £1.50 and taking home a bag of essentials for that week.Sam said the group has helped 160 people since it started.There are a number of foodbanks operating in Dundee – however, many of them operate on a referral basis, meaning professionals like GPs or social workers can send people to receive a food parcel.Sam said she wanted Food for Thought to help people who “fell between the lines” and didn’t meet the criteria to be referred by outside agencies.She added: “It is a huge help for some people who might be struggling. It means that people have the basics sorted out and then they can maybe use the little money they have on something else they need.“It can mean that people don’t have to go without certain things or make the really hard decisions.”Food for Thought gets its produce from donations and also FairShare – a scheme which aims to cut down on waste and poverty by distributing items close to their sell-by date around community organisations.One of the patrons, Lynne Anderson, 40, from Dryburgh, hailed the project and the organisers behind it as “amazing”. She said: “It is a brilliant thing. I heard about it through the playgroup and popped in to see what was going on.“It is just a brilliant thing that Sam is doing.”Not only does the scheme mean that people who might go hungry have an option to turn to, Sam said it has also doubled up as a social group – with people turning out to enjoy each other’s company.She added she would back similar projects right around the city – but is unable to branch out owing to childcare commitments.However she said her long-term plans are to open a larger shop with the same ethos as the foodbank.She also praised the community support for the project – including local charity Yusuf Youth Initiative – which she said had promoted it.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/12/Vet-stock.jpg

ideas such as the installation of a mezzanine floor and the creation of more open space could be the key to the transformation of Inverness\u0027 Victorian Market.Since taking up the role of market manager six months ago, Jo Murray has been exploring ways in which the historic site\u0027 future viability can be secured as well as meeting traders and other interested groups regularly.Suggestions, which have now been put forward, include extending opening hours, revamping shop fronts and hosting events as well as taking a radical look at the how the market hall section might be remodelled in a bid to attract local residents to shop at the historic landmark.\"The Victorian Market is very much loved by the local community but the local community doesn\u0026rsquot necessarily use it,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We need to encourage local customers to come in and shop.\"Under the action plan, a proposed programme of work is set be carried out in three phases.The first priority is to refurbish the stonework at the market\u0027 Academy Street entrance and replace the glass door.\"It is a really iconic entrance,\" Mrs Murray said.\"But I think it is recognised the smoked glass which has been installed is a bit of a visual barrier to the market. The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

It will also incorporate the North tower, which has been open to the public as a viewing platform for more than a year and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.Locals and tourists can also look forward to

signing Chris Forrester today vowed to be an influential goal-scoring playmaker – starting in Europe.The midfielder became Dons boss Derek McInnes’ first major signing of the summer when signing a three-year contract from Peterborough United.Rated as a multi-million star by Peterborough only 18 months ago, the Dons secured the 25-year-old for a fee understood to be £200,0000.Former Posh captain Forrester had a year left on his contract at Peterborough but was slapped on the transfer list at the end of the season by Steve Evans.The midfielder is a former Republic of Ireland U21 cap and broke into the senior squad in 2016 but has still to be capped.Dons boss Derek McInnes’ main priority in the transfer window was to replace the void left by the exit of Kenny McLean.Scotland cap McLean was the Reds’ main midfield playmaker but has left Pittodrie for Championship side Norwich City.Forrester insists he can bring that creative spark McInnes is searching for and aims to hit the ground running in the Europa League.He said: “I am not afraid to get on the ball as that is what I love to do.“I love to get the game going and passing to the lads that can maybe score the goals.“This season I want to be the one receiving the ball, doing something with it and also scoring a few goals.“In the last two seasons at Peterborough I forgot how to find the goal.“Coming up here one of my main aims is to get back in amongst the goals.“I aim to be a goal scoring midfielder as opposed to someone just sitting in the middle and passing the ball.“I want to see myself up there pressing the ball and creating the assists or creating the goal that wins the game.”Aberdeen had also made an enquiry about Forrester’s Peterborough team-mate Jack Baldwin.However, the Reds cooled their interest in the defender.Forrester revealed boss McInnes was pivotal in persuading him to move to Pittodrie.He said: “He (McInnes) said he sees me as an important player for the team which is music to my ears.“He said he sees me coming into the team and being the main passer which is what I liked to hear.“That helped to bring me here.”Aberdeen enter the Europa League at the second qualifying round stage on July 26.Despite playing in England’s third tier, Forrester has no concerns about making his Dons debut on the continental stage.He played in Europe for both Bohemians and St Patrick’s Athletic from the League of Ireland.He said: “My first European trip was with Bohemians when I was 18 and we went to Slovenia to play Ljubljana (Olimpija).“That was a massive experience for me and I did that every year I was in the League of Ireland.“For about five years I went on European trips and had some great results.“We (St Patrick’s Athletic) knocked out Siroki Brijeg (of Bosnia, 3-2 aggregate in 2012).“We also played Legia Warsaw which was a massive game in front of a massive crowd.“We were 1-0 up until the scored an equalizer in the 89th minute (1-1 first leg, 5-0 second for 6-1 aggregate

harbour","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA north-east Boys’ Brigade is making a bid to clean up a town’s harbour – with a unique piece of equipment.Members of the 1st Fraserburgh Boys’ Brigade have so far raised £900 to purchase a Seabin for the town’s harbour.The piece of equipment costs £3,000 and can be submerged to collect waste 24 hours a day using a pump to suck rubbish from the sea surface.The idea came from warrant officer Grant Duthie, who saw the environmentally-friendly piece of equipment advertised online.Officers at the company are delighted with the amount raised so far.Warrant officer in the company section Ryan Clark said: “We wanted to do a fundraiser for something a bit different, hence the choice of the Seabin.“It was originally suggested through our president’s badge boys’ meeting by Grant Duthie, who also volunteers for the local lifeboat crew and it went from there.“It’s now a company section goal to raise the money through various fundraisers, such as coffee mornings, sponsored sports challenges and other events.“Originally, our plan was to raise the money over a couple of years, but with the speed that we’ve raised funds already, we hope to have it done in maybe over a year or so.”Once the Seabin is full it can be emptied and the contents recycled.It can catch everything floating in the water, including plastic bottles, paper and fuel.Fish are not caught because they do not get close enough to the surface to be pulled in.Clean water is then pumped back into the sea, helping to keep pollution levels down.The group, one of three Boys’ Brigade companies in the town, has already approached the harbour with the idea.Marc Thomson, officer in the company section, added that the efforts will count towards the boys’ badge

its reputation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe boss of the Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm has said that he believes the development could “change the history” of the city.Speaking during a boat visit to the new wind farm, also known as the European Offshore Wind Development Centre (EOWDC), Vattenfall project director Adam Ezzamel said that he wants the project to change Aberdeen from a traditional “oil and gas hub” to a city known for renewable energy.Once hooked up to the grid, the new wind farm will supply enough electricity to power 80,000 homes, with one turn of a turbine powerful enough to supply an average house with enough electricity for an entire day.Mr Ezzamel said: “This project is all about transferring Aberdeen from an oil hub to a global energy hub with Scotland’s largest test and demonstration centre.\u0026#8220It’s a power station in its own right that will be powering more than 70% of Aberdeen’s domestic electricity demand on an annual basis.”“We have borrowed technology from the oil and gas industry and put it into the renewables industry.\u0026#8220This development can really change the way people think about Aberdeen.”Mr Ezzamel also said yesterday that he believes the Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm to be the fastest built offshore wind development in Scotland’s history.The wind farm boasts some of the most powerful turbines in the world thanks to an innovative suction bucket foundation which has been sunk into the sands off Aberdeen Bay.With the project taking just nine weeks from first foundation to final turbine, Mr Ezzamel believes it is “surely” the fastest build of a wind farm off Scotland’s shores.He said: “I’ve looked hard for counter examples, but none are forthcoming. It’s has been a very, very fast process here.\u0026#8220It’s one of the advantages of the technology we’ve used. I can’t see anything else being quicker.”Vattenfall installation manager Alistair Leighton agrees: “One installation only took two hours and forty minutes and we’ve got vessels that can lay the field very quickly.Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm has embraced all sorts of new technology and some of that was really familiar to people who traditionally work in oil and gas.“There’s so much scope for skills to be transferred from oil and gas to renewable energy in the north-east.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"two aberdeen schools shut due to burst water main","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTwo schools in Aberdeen have been forced to close today due to a burst water main.Torry Academy and Walker Road School are both shut to staff and pupils following the incident on West Tullos Road.Scottish Water has been called to deal with the burst water main, with residents in the AB11 postcode area possibly seeing issues with their water supply.Section of busy Aberdeen road shut due to burst water main\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"film makers turn lens on to russian tourneymedia trio to capture football fan fests in red square","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThree employees of an Aberdeen firm jetted off today to the World Cup in Russia.Keith Robertson, Derek Allan and Euan Gray from Granite City firm AVC Immedia are on their way to Russia to cover the footballing extravaganza.The trio are working with Fifa to produce films about the World Cup.Robertson, who used to play for Peterhead as well as Cove Rangers, Deveronvale and Keith in the Highland League, will be based in Moscow.Allan and Gray are aiming to visit all 11 host cities during the tournament.Robertson explained the work they will be carrying out during the event.He said: “We work with Fifa attending events and educational programmes and creating content.“This time we’re going over to do content creation at a thing called fan fests.“These are for people who don’t have tickets for games to go and watch them with other fans.“They’re going to have fan fests in places like Red Square in Moscow and they want us to capture it all.”The AVC team have a wealth of experience, having previously done World Cups, Under-20 and U17 World Cup as well as Champions League and Europa League finals.Robertson added: “It’s still pretty exciting and it’s now beginning to settle in.“We’ve got our visas, our flights and our accreditation.“It’s been quite a difficult challenge to get across to Russia.“But it’s almost second nature to some of the guys to head off and do it.”This is Robertson’s third World Cup, having also been in Germany in 2006 and South Africa in 2010.A particular highlight was covering the 2010 final between Spain and Holland and following English referee Howard Webb.He said: “I was based with the referees for seven weeks.“They were based in this private complex in Pretoria and I was on site with them for seven weeks.“You are going to the games with them and you become used to these sort of games.“We’re fortunate enough that we get access to a lot of areas that traditional media wouldn’t.“We were part of a film about the final in South Africa which followed all elements of the final all day.“We did the referee element of it so that was Howard Webb, Darren Cann and Mike Mullarkey.“We followed them from when they got up and had breakfast right the way through to the end.“I was with the referees the whole way so I was in the dressing rooms at half-time and full-time.“It was a bit random at times.“I still remember after the final Gerard Pique was looking for the net.“I had come out of the referees’ room and he was standing there with a beer asking me if I knew where the net is.“I was helping him try to find the groundsmen’s cupboard which was a bit bizarre – but that’s what can happen.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp.

We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25.

Bella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick. But the large salon in Irvine’s Rivergate mall has been shut. However boss Nigel Howard,47, of Alloway, insists the workforce is safe despite a formal winding up notice. He’s a former Ayr United centre half star who played more than 50 games for the club between 1991 and 94. A petition lodged at Ayr Sheriff Court on behalf of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs wants Bella Mani Salons (Ayr \u0026amp Irvine) Ltd wound up by the court. They also want a liquidator put in place and any parties claiming an interest in the action must get it touch by this Thursday. There are eight branches , some run by differently named companies. Bella Mani Salons (Ayr and Irvine) was launched five years ago with a registered address at the Prestwick Main Street Salon. Bella Mani Salons (Prestwick) has Gabriella Howard as the sole director. The firm has been a salon of the year at the Scottish Hair and Beauty Awards and INAA make-up artisit of the year.  Bella Mani Salons (Kilmarnock) was dissolved last June and Bella Mani Salons (Motherwell) went the same way ten weeks ago. Both these firms had a registered address at the Howard home in Alloway. Nigel is listed as the sole active director of the Ayr\u0026ampIrvine firm, his wife Victoria resigned as a director in 2013, just nine months after the company was incorporated. But on Monday Nigel would not say how much tax HMRC is looking for and that it was “complicated and being contested.” He said: “Staff have been worried but I have assured them everything is fine. This is a dormant company that does not affect day to day running. The Irvine salon is shut and we are moving to a smaller one in the High Street. “I think this is a positive story and we work very hard to keep a total of 64 staff in jobs.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"drive through coffee shop petrol","story":"NewsDrive-through coffee shop and petrol pumps could be built on busy main roadThe ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:45, 6 JUN 2018NewsA77 near Dutch House Roundabout (Image: Alister Firth/Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA drive-through coffee shop and petrol pumps are to be built on the A77 if plans get the green light. The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"gym group set open 24","story":"NewsThe Gym Group set to open 24 hour facilities in AyrThe group which runs more than 120 outlets across the UK, is scheduled to open a 15,000sq ft unit in the early part of 2019.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:26, 5 JUN 2018NewsHeathfield Retail Park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA 24-hour gym is to become the newest tenant at Ayr’s Heathfield Retail Park, as the firm’s expansion across Scotland continues.

He said: “We are losing something like 72,000sq ft of trading space owing to retailer failures and consolidation in the marketplace. “It goes without saying that is a lot to deal with, but our park – and Ayr as a destination in general – is very resilient. “Interest in the site from new names has not slowed and the acquisition of both Wren and the Gym Group is testament to that. “Since we acquired the park, we have carried out 11 new lettings and the arrival of Wren and the Gym Group takes that to 13. “That proves we are continuing to move in the right direction and our faith in the park remains as strong as ever.”  Ediston, who bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million, have attracted big names like M\u0026ampS, Costa and DFS to the site in the intervening years. And Mr Dickie says further investment is to follow as the park looks to rally from this year’s trading setbacks. He added: “We have plans in place to spend a further \u0026pound2 million in September of this year “And moving forward, we have a strong business plan to ensure the prosperity of the park and its future. “I fully believe we are now through the worst of what has been a turbulent spell.” The Gym Group, founded in 2008 by former English squash player John Treharne, operates one other Ayrshire branch in Kilmarnock. It follows a \u0026pound500,000 investment when it took over a Lifestyle Fitness outlet at the Queen’s Drive retail park.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The couple now live in Kilmarnock. “We actually met about 15 years ago when both of us used to go ice skating at the Magnum on a Friday night,” said Kim. The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece. The kilts were from MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick.  The couple’s wedding party consisted of flowergirls - Daughters, Macie O’Donnell and Evie McLauchlan and bride’s sister Molly Miller Page boys were son, Alfie McLauchlan and bride’s brother Jack Miller and the best man was Groom’s brother-in-law, Richard Hunter. Kim continued: “We haven’t managed to get away on a honeymoon yet as we have three children so picking a destination has been quite difficult! “We do plan on going somewhere we just haven’t decided where yet.” KSG Photography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with beautiful photos to look back on. Claire’s Crystal Brides arranged the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo and Jett Patterson of Allure Hair \u0026amp Beauty, Kilmarnock created the hair and beauty looks for the day. Kim added: “Our cake was made by a friend who is a cake maker, Diane Kay. “We didn’t really have a clue about a cake so we just sent Diane some pictures and trusted her to make us a gorgeous cake and we were not disappointed!  “We had a white three tier cake with silver and diamant\u0026eacute lace trim, it fitted the wedding theme perfectly and was absolutely delicious.” The couple added: “Thanks to all the staff at the Vu for an absolutely amazing day. “Kevin the photographer, Waterfront the band, Winton Weddings for our stunning decor, Susan from Opus Couture for helping me chose my stunning dress and all our friends and family who attended the wedding and made it the most perfect special day! “My best friend, Shelby McAllister for being right by my side for the full day and keeping me calm in the lead up to the wedding. “And last but not least - my Grampa Willie for walking me down the aisle and making all my dreams come true!” For more photos of this week’s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

But the iconic pile will remain under Malaysian control, after a deal was struck to keep it in South East Asian hands. It follows a purchase of the building by “experienced hoteliers” for an undisclosed fee from countryman, Eng Huat Ung. Student flats and offices are among development plans in the pipeline, the Post has learned. Now bosses are seeking talks with South Ayrshire Council, who in March slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the site.  Structural engineers are being lined up to tackle the hotel, which has fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years. A source close to the deal said: “You can be rest assured that the new owners are keen to redevelop this building and put it to good use as soon as possible.” Mr Ung snapped up the property in a \u0026pound750,000 deal back in 2010. But attempts to keep it afloat as a hotel quickly failed and two Dangerous Building notices have followed. Bosses at Network Rail, who run the town’s train station underneath, have also grown increasingly concerned for the impact on their platforms. We revealed how a rat infestation was among the ongoing problems uncovered.  And council chiefs warned that a “wake-up call” was needed after issuing their March order on the building. Another source linked to the buy-out added: “The hotel has been in desperate need of a new direction for many years now. “This new investment should be welcomed by all in the town of Ayr and hopefully it signals the start of a much brighter future for a grand building.” A council spokesman said: “We understand the building has been bought but at this stage we have had no official confirmation. “We’ll continue to talk to the owners to ensure the building is kept in a good state of general repair.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thousands pounds pocketed council after","story":"NewsThousands of pounds pocketed by council after secret VAT grabBut they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston14:18, 6 JUN 2018NewsCouncillor Peter Convery brands move on VAT “sleekit”\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of pounds is being pocketed by a council after a secret VAT grab. But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church mulling over decision","story":"NewsTroon church mulling over decision to allow gay couples to marryThe congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley15:25, 5 JUN 2018NewsRev Tom Montgomery (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA church is deciding whether to allow gay couples to get married in Troon. The congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision. The vestry have split views on whether the Bentinck Drive Episcopal Church should give same-gender couples the blessing to walk up the aisle. The Rev Canon Tom Montgomery said: “Jesus was radically inclusive.” Speaking to the Post, he said: “I believe the Lord Jesus would welcome same-gender attracted people and would want them to be happy. Jesus has unconditional love for us all. “I have worked with same-gender attracted people who have had their hearts broken because they can’t express their love openly.” He said it is about “promoting and encouraging respect of all people”. The rector asked for the views of the vestry at a dedicated meeting, where he said there was a “diversity of views” among the congregation.  He added: “At the moment we are praying through the decision of the General Synod and are continuing to seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  “There is a wide spectrum of opinion.”   Rev Canon Montgomery would have to get authorisation from the bishop and the Registrar General of Scotland before conducting the marriages. The Scottish Episcopal Church voted to allow same-sex marriage in the church if clergy opt in. Reverend Montgomery said some are all for it while others are reticent because of their upbringing and the Bible’s teachings.  He said: “In the Bible there is no mention in the Gospel about same-gender attraction.”  But he said same-sex relationships are mentioned in a letter of St Paul and the Old Testament’s Book of Leviticus.   But he pointed out the Bible said women who commit adultery should be stoned, which people would be horrified by.  He added: “Jesus has a bias towards the downtrodden and excluded.”  And he appealed for same-sex couples and gay people in the congregation to “stick with us”. He added: “I am aware of your hurt and disappointment, as I acknowledge mine, but it is amazing what can happen when people pray and try to see what it really feels like from another person’s perspective.” "},{"url":null,"title":"WATCH   Greatest chocolate shop  in the Borders reopens after major refit","story":"THE \u0027greatest chocolate shop\u0027 in the Scottish Borders is set to

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

after it was established in 1998.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoThis is about peace, not Brexit.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about awarding Northern Ireland honorary EU association as a European place of

in Northern Ireland, reflecting the success of ERASMUS, joining the dots of all other EU actions in conflict zones, setting up a European centre of peacebuilding in Belfast and launching a path of peace from Northern Ireland to Nicosia, named the White Dove Way after our own Columbanus the patron saint of unified Europe.\nHer petition called on leaders like Prime Minister Theresa May, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to grant the special status.\nMore than 4,700 people have so far signed it.\nMs Morrice added: \u0026ldquoWhile the referendum has thrown another cloak of division over politics in Northern Ireland and instability over much of our economic life, there is little doubt that economically, socially and politically, Northern Ireland stands to lose more than any other part of the UK if Brexit goes ahead.\n\u0026ldquoThe political and cultural division between green and orange, British/Irish, pro and anti Brexit is destined to grow wider as divorce day approaches and the sword of Damocles drops on the border dividing us even further.\n\u0026ldquoFor the sake of our children and grandchildren, those of us who grew up in troubled times in Northern Ireland know we cannot and must not allow this to happen.\nHonorary EU association would retain the status of Northern Ireland as part of the EU, part of the UK and part of the British/Irish and North/South Council in keeping with the Good Friday Belfast Agreement, the petition said.\nIt would respect the will of the people of Northern Ireland who voted to stay in the EU, keep the Irish border open and recognise the right of those who wish to retain EU citizenship as British and/or Irish citizens, it added.\nMs Morrice is a former member of the Women\u0026rsquos

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"LOOKING BACK  Remembering the first ever Haddington Festival","story":"              HADDINGTON Festival is celebrating its golden anniversary at the moment, with the event having put a smile on thousands of faces since 1968.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The latest success for 20-year-old Rebecca Traynor was coming top in the recent final of Linlithgow\u0026rsquos Got Talent.  The soprano was also among the finalists for a competition on Forth 1 to find a singer to perform a contemporary pop song on the station\u0026rsquos breakfast show.  She made it through an initial round that saw her sing on the show and, on Monday, she joined other contestants at Forth House for auditions.  However, the former Musselburgh Grammar School pupil was not chosen as the overall winner.  Rebecca\u0026rsquos singing talent was first spotted by her class teacher when she was a pupil at Pinkie St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School. She won the school\u0026rsquos talent competition at the age of 10, performing Hallelujah.  Her teacher phoned her dad to say she thought Rebecca had a good voice and might benefit from lessons. This was duly done and she developed her skills with advice on breathing and holding notes from a coach.  She completed exams held by Trinity College London \u0026ndash the international exam board for the performing arts and English language.  Rebecca, from Edenhall, is also a former winner of the Musselburgh Rotary Club Young Musician of the Year competition. A double winner of Wishaw\u0026rsquos Got Talent, she also scooped top spot in Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Got Talent in 2014.  \u0026ldquoI love singing, she told the Courier.

In total, 24 fourth-year students from Musselburgh Grammar School received hands-on experience in team building, staging an event, kitchen and cooking essentials, and barista skills as part of an ongoing partnership with the school.  The students also heard presentations from Craig Bonnar of award-winning catering company and official racecourse supplier Heritage Portfolio Susan Manchester, general manager of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art cafes and Sarah Montgomery, the racecourse\u0026rsquos senior operations and commercial manager.  Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.  This year, Musselburgh was one of 20 UK racecourses to take part in the Racing Together Community Day, which supports a range of activities in local communities.  Sarah Montgomery said: \u0026ldquoIn past years we have been very active in supporting Business in the Community\u0026rsquos Give and Gain days but this year we opted to strengthen the relationship we have been building with Musselburgh Grammar School.  \u0026ldquoWith excellent support from Heritage Portfolio, we were able to put on a diverse programme which gave real-life experience to 20 students who have expressed an interest in hospitality and tourism careers, and this will contribute to their employability pathways initiative.  \u0026ldquoThree of those students returned to the racecourse to support us in hosting a British Horseracing Authority roadshow which provided a valuable opportunity for the pupils to put their training into practice and which will be a useful addition to their CVs.  Caroline Brown, acting depute headteacher at the Grammar, said that the relationship between the school and the VisitScotland five-star racecourse was proving fruitful for both pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis kind of real-life insight into the world of work and the wider hospitality and tourism sector is extremely helpful in giving students the experience and information which will help them decide on a career path they could potentially follow on leaving school.  \u0026ldquoAccess to the racecourse facilities and to experienced industry professionals who can share valuable insights is a real bonus and we are delighted that Musselburgh Racecourse was willing to work with us in supporting our young students as they prepare to transition from education to the working world."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7890693.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands sign petition calling for Northern Ireland to stay in EU post-Brexit","story":"              Almost 5,000 people have called for Northern Ireland to stay in the EU after Brexit.

Ms Morrice is a former head of the\u0026nbspEuropean Commission in Belfast and was deputy speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly after it was established in 1998.

More than 4,700 people have so far signed it.  Ms Morrice added: \u0026ldquoWhile the referendum has thrown another cloak of division over politics in Northern Ireland and instability over much of our economic life, there is little doubt that economically, socially and politically, Northern Ireland stands to lose more than any other part of the UK if Brexit goes ahead.  \u0026ldquoThe political and cultural division between green and orange, British/Irish, pro and anti Brexit is destined to grow wider as divorce day approaches and the sword of Damocles drops on the border dividing us even further.  \u0026ldquoFor the sake of our children and grandchildren, those of us who grew up in troubled times in Northern Ireland know we cannot and must not allow this to happen.  Honorary EU association would retain the status of Northern Ireland as part of the EU, part of the UK and part of the British/Irish and North/South Council in keeping with the Good Friday Belfast Agreement, the petition said.  It would respect the will of the people of Northern Ireland who voted to stay in the EU, keep the Irish border open and recognise the right of those who wish to retain EU citizenship as British and/or Irish citizens, it added.

Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806713.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"WHO admits mistaking Prestonpans for Preston on official pollution figures","story":"              THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has removed Prestonpans from its list of most polluted communities. . . after confirming that it had confused the East Lothian town with the English city of Preston!  There was widespread concern when the global monitor named Prestonpans as Scotland\u0026rsquos most polluted town in its latest breakdown of pollution figures earlier this month.  The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

Taking out some of the hard work, here we bring five fantastic golf courses to try out this summer.  Balmore Golf Club  Balmore Golf Club, set in the secluded rolling countryside of East Dunbartonshire\u0026nbspbetween Milngavie and Bishopbriggs, is probably the finest inland Scottish golf course you have yet to play. Central Scotland is blessed with many great courses, but they don\u0027t come any better than Balmore. A bold claim, but the club\u0026nbspare confident that once you play the perfectly manicured 18 holes designed by six-time British Open Champion Harry Vardon, you will agree\u0026nbsp- and be happy to tell others the same.    Founded in 1907, Balmore Golf Club has a proud history, but it has an even brighter future. Significant investments in facilities for the whole family such as a 6-hole Par 3 course with complimentary child membership and an extensive practice facility for keen golfers eager to perfect their game has uniquely positioned the club. It\u0027s a safe, family-friendly environment successfully attracting a new generation of members such as former Celtic and Scotland football star Kris Commons who joined during April\u0027s new member intake:  \"I\u0026rsquove played a lot of great golf courses in Scotland over the years,\" said Kris. \"But I decided to join Balmore Golf Club for two main reasons: the quality of the course itself, plus the stand-out practice facilities which are set up to cater to families. The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important. If you haven\u0026rsquot played Balmore yet, then I strongly recommend you give it a try \u0026ndash you won\u0026rsquot be disappointed.    Visit soon to judge for yourself!

The club are proud to be one of the best rated golf courses in the West of Scotland.    The course was set out by the celebrated James Braid for the Duke of Montrose in 1936 on the parkland of the Duke\u0026rsquos estate, so its holes and fairways are framed by majestic trees and magnificent views of the Trossachs. The backdrop promotes tranquillity and a sense of wellbeing even within the most trying of rounds and yet it is only 35 minutes from Glasgow city centre and only a mile from the picturesque village of Drymen. The historic ruins of Buchanan Castle overlook the course and there are many references to the Graham family within the well-appointed clubhouse.  Rob Roy McGregor walked the estate in the past so visitors and members are truly walking in the footsteps of legends.    In more recent times when the irascible Eric Brown was the professional at Buchanan Castle, the Ryder Cup sat proudly on his desk in the pro shop. In 2014 at the Gleneagles Ryder Cup the organising committees from Europe and the USA played a match at Buchanan Castle which speaks to the quality of the course.  The club is now in its second year of member control having taken over from the Montrose Estates in 2017, with plans to develop the golfing offer for members and visitors alike.  The club has successfully attracted 150 new members in the past year and is offering full membership at \u0026pound500.

It\u0027s a joy to play and most of the time very quiet, allowing the visitor to relish the ups and downs of the fairways and the tussle with undulating greens. The arresting views across to the islands of Islay, Jura and Gigha provide a delightful backdrop on an idyllic summer\u0027s day with the firm Machrihanish turf underfoot, the majesty of the dunes and wheeling seabirds providing the musical sound track.  To provide a varied test for the competent golfer, the layout is not just a predictable nine out and nine back. The classic links holes, apart from the 1st, are the 5th, another par four with its fairway like an elephant\u0027s graveyard, the 10th, a clever dogleg par five and the 15th, a \"one shotter\" with real difficulty if the elusive green is missed from the tee. Members can also enjoy complimentary use of the practise and putting areas.    The course ranks highly on a global scale. Golf Digest rated Machrihanish among the top 100 courses in the world in 2018, climbing 30 places to now rank 61st in the world. The club is also rated fourth best value for money within the UK.

Looking at successful small economies, the report concluded there was \u0026ldquono single specific policy model followed by all.  However, it stressed the importance of having a \u0026ldquodisciplined approach to fiscal policy, along with an \u0026ldquoefficient, competitive business environment that allows for firms to expand.  GDP growth in Scotland has averaged 1.4% since 2000, the report said, putting the country \u0026ldquonear the bottom of the small advanced economies group.  It stated: \u0026ldquoThere has been a consistent gap between Scotland\u0026rsquos GDP growth rates and that of other small advanced economies.  \u0026ldquoThis has led to a steady divergence in Scotland\u0026rsquos per capita income from that of other small advanced economies.  Analysis: Scale of disappointment over UK economy writ large in sterling falls  The report went on: \u0026ldquoPart of Scotland\u0026rsquos recent GDP growth weakness is due to the slowdown in the oil and gas sector (Norway has also suffered).  \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos relatively deep exposure to the rest of the UK, which has under-performed the rest of Europe by a significant margin over the past few years, is also a drag on performance.  Dr Skilling also argued tax rates must remain in line with other small advanced economies - pointing out that in the comparator countries the top rate for personal tax has been reduced from 47% to 44% since 2000.  In Scotland, the top rate of income tax - paid by those earning \u0026pound150,000 a year or more - was increased in the 2018-19 budget, making it higher than in the rest of the UK at 46p.  While spending on research and development can help improve competitiveness, the report said Scotland was \u0026ldquoin the bottom third of the advanced economies group in terms of total R\u0026ampD spending, at 1.5% of GDP in 2016.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspRural businesses could add billions to economy, says report  Reform Scotland director Chris Deerin said: \u0026ldquoThe report is not about nationalism or unionism - it is about how we in Scotland can create the conditions for greater economic growth in order to raise our standard of living and better fund our public services.  \u0026ldquoThe lessons from the paper are clear. To achieve economic success, we must ensure our tax rates are competitive, that we have a high-quality business environment and invest in human capital and innovation.  Dr Skilling looked at largely the same small economies studied in the SNP-commissioned Sustainable Growth Commission report, which examined the economic prospects for an independent Scotland.  Former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, who chaired the commission, said when the report was published recently that it showed \u0026ldquohow Scotland can emulate the best-performing economies and societies in the world.  Alison Moore, director of the Scottish Policy Foundation, said the Reform Scotland/David Skilling paper was \u0026ldquoone of a number that we are currently funding to add to the debate around Scotland\u0026rsquos economy and productivity.  She stated: \u0026ldquoThis paper is a valuable addition to the debate on our economy and we look forward to continuing to support this debate through our ongoing work.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos economy is strong, with output per head among the highest in the UK outside London and the south-east. We are also one of the top destinations for inward investment while Scottish productivity has grown faster than the UK\u0026rsquos over the past decade."},{"url":null,"title":"May facing No 10 showdown with Davis over Irish  back-stop  customs plan","story":"              THERESA May is facing a Downing Street showdown with her Brexit Secretary today after a major row broke out over EU withdrawal plans, which Brexiteer ministers fear could keep Britain in the customs union indefinitely.  The UK Government is expected this morning to publish details of its \u0026ldquoIrish back-stop proposal, which would only ever happen if a deal on a post-Brexit customs plan with Brussels was not agreed.  But David Davis is said to have been furious after a four-page draft was circulated and was due to be sent to the European Commission without the inclusion of a legally enforceable end-date the Government has previously made clear such a scenario should be time-limited.

Downing Street insisted it was confident the contingency plan would never be needed yet UK ministers are still divided over choosing their preferred post-Brexit customs plan the new customs partnership or maximum facilitation.  Mr Davis is also said to have clashed with the Prime Minister over publication of the Government\u0026rsquos eagerly-awaited Brexit White Paper, setting out its withdrawal strategy. She has thwarted his intention to publish it before the EU Council at the end of this month.  Mrs May will now chair a \u0026ldquoclear-the-air meeting of her so-called Brexit War Cabinet before she travels to Canada for the G7 summit.  Mr Davis said he \"expected\" there would be a time limit in the signed-off version of the back-stop plan but did not appear totally sure.  After giving a speech on Brexit and security, the Secretary of State said the details had yet to be approved but believed today\u0026rsquos meeting of the Cabinet\u0027s Brexit sub-committee would be \"decisive\".  Asked if he could stay in his job if the Government\u0027s back-stop plan did not have his approval, Mr Davis replied: \"That\u0027s a question for the Prime Minister, to be honest.\"  READ MORE: SNP\u0027s Ian Blackford signals more flights to Scotland could help party vote for Heathrow expansion  Her spokesman, asked if the Secretary of State had threatened to resign over the back-stop issue, said: \u0026ldquoNot that I\u0027m aware of, no.  Tom Brake for the Liberal Democrats said the back-stop plan talks were an \u0026ldquoexercise in futility, noting how the EU had already ruled out the possibility of a contingency plan covering the whole of the UK.  \"It is clear the Tories have no clue what the UK\u0026rsquos options are, he insisted.  Earlier at a rowdy Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, Jeremy Corbyn mocked Mrs May over the delay in publishing the White Paper and deciding on a customs option, saying, to Labour laughter, she had delivered \"more delays and cancellations\" than the troubled Northern Rail service.  The PM hit back, repeating her pledge to avoid a hard Irish border and accusing Labour of seeking to \"frustrate\" the Brexit process at every stage.  Ian Blackford for the SNP referred to reports that civil servants had drawn up scenarios for a \"Doomsday Brexit,\" that would leave the country short of medicine, fuel and food.  \"And now the Dutch are telling Dutch businesses not to risk buying UK products, said the Highland MP. \u0026ldquoDoes the Prime Minister understand the catastrophic negotiating position she has cornered herself into?\" he asked.

Meanwhile, rebel MPs from both sides of the Commons are pushing for a Norway-style Brexit agreement, which would keep the UK in the single market, when they vote on Lords amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill next Tuesday.  Mrs May and Mr Corbyn have rejected such a deal but pro-EU MPs in both their parties claim remaining in the European Economic Area would be the best Brexit deal for jobs and businesses.  Among the Labour rebels is Edinburgh MP Ian Murray while among the Tory ones is Paul Masterton, who represents East Renfrewshire.  Rebel Labour MPs have accused their leadership of \"bailing out\" the PM from a potential Commons defeat but Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, admitted the issue of EEA membership had deeply divided his parliamentary party.

What I saw there shocked me. Witnessing the colossal and devastating impact of bombs, shells and rockets is nothing new to me as a reporter, but Raqqa was something else.  During my time in the city, I recall one afternoon standing on the bullet-pocked balcony of a flat belonging to a local man called Khalil al-Khalil.  \u0026ldquoLook around you, he insisted with a sweep of his arm, as we gazed out across the surrounding streets.  Everywhere, crumbling shell smashed tower blocks stretched as far as we could see and the charred burnt out carapaces of cars lay in the streets.  \u0026ldquoSo far we have received no help and the outside world seems to have forgotten us, but the people of Raqqa are rich in their character and we will rebuild the city that is our home, of that I\u0026rsquom certain, Mr Khalil told me, his voice exuding the sort of determination that will be needed to undertake the daunting task he suggests.  Today Raqqa is all but unrecognisable even to its citizens, some of whom like Mr al-Khalil have returned from across Syria and beyond to try resurrecting their lives and businesses.  Many cities of course have been destroyed in the wars in Iraq and Syria since 2011, but the destruction is worse in Raqqa than anywhere else. An estimated 11,000 buildings are destroyed or severely damaged, and the remains of countless bodies still lie under its canyons of ruins their stench drifting on the breeze.  While recently accompanying the Civil Defence Unit volunteers tasked with recovering these remains, the team members told me that currently they still had 6,000 open reports of corpses and body parts that needed responding to.  Raqqa was of course the self-proclaimed capital of the Islamic State (IS) group\u0026rsquos caliphate. It was here that the jihadists carried out their grisly repertoire of hangings, beheadings, torture and sexual slavery.  Given that this was their base and hub, the city bore the brunt of air and artillery strikes by the US and its allies including Britain and France. Throughout this military campaign this coalition force consistently claimed that they precisely targeted IS fighters and positions during the five-month siege that destroyed swathes of the city.  But this week a newly released report entitled \u0026ldquoWar of Annihilation,based on an investigation by human rights group, Amnesty International (AI), comprehensively contradicts such assertions, suggesting the coalition\u0026rsquos campaign of bombardment probably breached international humanitarian law and potentially amount to war crimes.  The report, details the loss of civilian life in Raqqa, based on interviews with 112 civilians at the sites of 42 coalition airstrikes, and its conclusions are damning to say the least  \u0026ldquoThe coalition\u0027s claims that its precision air campaign allowed it to bomb IS out of Raqqa while causing very few civilian casualties do not stand up to scrutiny, said Amnesty\u0027s senior crisis response adviser, Donatella Rovera.  \u0026ldquoOn the ground in Raqqa we witnessed a level of destruction comparable to anything we have seen in decades of covering the impact of wars,Ms Rovera added.  In further comments she went on to quote senior US military officer as saying that \u0026ldquomore artillery shells were launched into Raqqa than anywhere since the end of the Vietnam War.  A spokesman for the US-led coalition meanwhile, slammed Amnesty\u0026rsquos report, saying that the rights group never approached the Pentagon about its findings and was out of line for suggesting the coalition has violated international law.  \u0026ldquoThey are literally judging us guilty until proven innocent, that\u0026rsquos a bold rhetorical move by an organisation that fails to check the public record or consult the accused, Col. Thomas Veale told reporters at the Pentagon via a video briefing from Baghdad.  That the battle to liberate Raqqa, Codenamed the Wrath of Euphrates,was a no quarter military campaign is beyond doubt. That much was clear from the outset when then US Secretary of Defence James Mattis announced the acceleration of operations against IS in May 2017.  \u0026ldquoOur intention is that the foreign fighters do not survive the fight to return home to North Africa, to Europe, to America, to Asia, to Africa. We are not going to allow them to do so. We are going to stop them there and take apart the caliphate, Mattis said at the time.  That Raqqa was taken apart in that process is also beyond doubt. According to independent research groups that track American and Russian airstrikes in Syria, US aircraft and artillery bombarded Raqqa with an estimated 20,000 munitions during the five month operation. This is more than was dropped in all of Afghanistan in the whole of 2017.  For now the controversy surrounding the coalition\u0026rsquos actions and Amnesty\u0026rsquos findings is sure to go on. It will be little consolation of course to those Syrians who lost family and loved ones in Raqqa.  But while little can be done for the dead, much can be done for those who survived and right now are struggling to rebuild their lives.  The US-led coalition, Britain included, help wreck the city, but there is precious little evidence that they are willing to take responsibility for putting it back together.  Eight months on the city has no running water or electricity, and there is virtually no help with the dangerous and pressing task of defusing the countless unexploded devices and ordnance around the city that continues to kill and maim civilians.  The volunteer Civil Defence Unit that I accompanied were sometimes scouring the rubble for body parts wearing nothing but thin surgical gloves, while such is the shortages they facethat even the body bags used for their grisly collection are recycled after emptying.  Right now there is humanitarian imperative to help the people of Raqqa. There is one other good reason too why they should not be ignored. For while IS might have been ousted from the city, their cadres still lurk ready and willing to exploit anger and frustration. Wrecking Raqqa was the easy part. Putting peoples lives back together is more difficult. Right now there it not a moment to lose."},{"url":null,"title":"Series of pledges made by Festival as it launches 2018 programme","story":"              THIS year will see the biggest Edinburgh Festival Fringe yet, with more than 3,500 shows, nearly 57,000 performances, and plans for a major revamp of outdoor shows on the Royal Mile.

In a section dedicated to keeping the Fringe affordable for artists, it says: \"The moment Edinburgh becomes too expensive for artists is the moment the Fringe ceases to function.\"  The Society, which runs the festival, is currently based in three buildings, including its well-known shop on the High Street, and Ms McCarthy said it is open to either a new building or utilising a new one for a new base in the capital.  Ms McCarthy said that many of the aspirations in the document is also a \"massive call out for help\" to other major bodies in the city, including the city council, to help deliver the changes.

This year the annual festival is to experiment with cashless donations to performers on the city\u0027s Royal Mile during the Fringe.  In an age where contactless payments are becoming more common, the Fringe is to run a trial of such payments for performers on their new stages in the centre of the city this August.  The Fringe is currently considering two options for the payments: a standardised amount which people can then tap with their cashcards on some kind of payment device, or a system with a \"degree of flexibility\" so the audience can pay what they want.  The festival also wants to somehow relate the new cashless payment system to the traditional \"passing around of the hat\" that usually follows a live performance on the Royal Mile.  Oliver Davies, the head of marketing at the festival, said: \"The idea this year is to trial in on four of the stages this year, and roll it out more widely after we see what we get back from it.  \"There will be a transactional fee which we are working with the provider to drive down as much as we can, and again its the kind of thing that if we develop the programme, if we can reduce that figure down even further, then brilliant.\"  Money will be collected into one pot, and then given to performers afterwards, he said.  He added: \"We are trying to get a good mix. Because it\u0027s a trial we want to get a variety of different pay points.  \"So we are going to try and mix it across the landscape, on The Mound as well as the High Street, so that will give it the details we need on how to roll it out.\"  This year the Fringe is also introducing a number of Sensory Backpacks, for children and adults on the autism spectrum.

A poll for the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) found more than half of people were planning a trip overseas in the next 12 months, and of those 9% would consider bringing back plants, seeds, bulbs, tubers or cuttings.  It could mean many holidaymakers bringing back plant material in their luggage and raising the risk of importing new pests and diseases that could damage gardens, the RHS said.  While there are some restrictions on importing plants in personal baggage, Britons travelling abroad should avoid bringing back any plants, the RHS urged as it unveiled\u0026nbspthe survey findings during the Chatsworth Flower Show.  British gardens face threats from new plants and diseases from abroad, such as \u0026ldquogame changing bacterium Xylella fastidiosa which can hit more than 350 different types of plant, with lavender,\u0026nbsphebe, rosemary and flowering cherry at high risk.  Fuschia gall mite, which disfigures plants and is now rife in the South East, has been attributed to an enthusiast for the plant illegally importing cuttings from South America.  While clothes, alcohol and fridge magnets are the most common things bought on foreign holidays, plants, flowers, wooden items and seeds are among the\u0026nbsp items those quizzed for the poll say they have brought back.  Plants were bought from garden centres, supermarkets, local markets, or even collected from gardens or the wild.  Nearly a third (31%) of those responding to the survey\u0026nbspof 2,066 people by YouGov are planning trips to Italy, France or Spain in the next 12 months \u0026ndash all countries where Xylella has already been found, the RHS said.  Its call to holidaymakers not to bring back plants from their foreign travels is backed by the Environment Department (Defra), which is launching a Don\u0026rsquot Risk It campaign this summer to raise awareness of the problems of bringing back cut flowers, fruit, vegetables and plant material from holiday spots.  Sue Biggs, director general of the Royal Horticultural Society, said: \u0026ldquoFor many people, wandering the olive groves of Italy and lavender fields of France are as much a part of the holiday experience as the cities and beaches.  \u0026ldquoBut we\u0026rsquore asking people to leave these beautiful plants where they are for future visitors to enjoy and not to bring them back home with them.  \u0026ldquoThis is vital if we are going to win the fight to protect our gardens against the growing threat of pests and diseases.          This summer we will be launching our \u0026lsquoDon\u0026rsquot Risk It\u0026rsquo campaign to raise awareness of the risks of bringing back plant materials from holiday destinations.

Regulator Ofgem said an investigation found that SSE sent out 1.15 million statements that were inaccurate and misleading\u0026nbspbetween June 2014 and September 2015.  The energy watchdog said that due to an IT\u0026nbspcoding error, these annual statements had incorrect information on the alternative cheaper tariff available to customers and inaccurate estimates of how much they could save annually by switching to them.  Some statements also overestimated the annual savings the customers could make by changing their pre-payment meter to a standard credit meter paying by direct debit, as well as by moving to paperless billing.  Ofgem, which\u0026nbsplaunched the probe last November after\u0026nbspSSE reported the issue,\u0026nbspadded that SSE failed to act quickly to address the errors.  It said: \u0026ldquoThe investigation found that SSE failed to act promptly to put things right, by not identifying the issue at an early stage and by not escalating action to address it or putting in place appropriate remedial actions.  \u0026ldquoThe supplier also failed to put in place arrangements and processes around customer communications that were complete, thorough and fit for purpose.  It said it had decided\u0026nbspnot to take formal enforcement action, in view of SSE\u0026rsquos steps taken since to address the failings, the low level of harm caused to customers and the \u0026pound1 million agreed payment.  Ofgem confirmed that\u0026nbspSSE has since improved its processes to prevent incorrect statements being issued again, including extra checks on customer communications.  SSE will pay the \u0026pound1 million penalty into Ofgem\u0026rsquos consumer redress fund administered by the Energy Saving Trust, which supports consumers in vulnerable situations and the development of innovative products or services."}]
