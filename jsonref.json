He grew up in Leipzig and spent his childhood under communism, then his teens, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, under capitalism he was fascinated to see familiar streetscapes colonised by advertising hoardings. His career has reflected that dichotomy. He has worked as a commercial photographer to fund an enduring fascination with the post-Soviet atmospheres of the east. When fellow art students relocated to London or Berlin after graduating, he settled in Moscow and began making photographs of the city’s interiors, taking his Hasselblad camera into waiting rooms and tiled hotel lobbies and curious bars, alive to juxtaposition and surreal comedy.This picture was taken in the meadows on the banks of the River Moscow, on the fringe of the 850th anniversary park. The contrast in scale and tone between the picnicking mother and her toddler and the vast, foreboding architecture of the electricity pylons is typical of Herfort’s work. He is drawn to scenes in which people innocently inhabit places slightly beyond their understanding, as if they have been dropped there from a different time and place altogether.There is something about what he calls the “chaos and the lightness and good-naturedness of ordinary Russians” that he tries to frame in different ways. The contrasts between the pictures he takes are as important as the contrasts within them. “I was always interested in shooting single photographs,” he says, “which show worlds and stories in one image.” He finds the classical reportage style, where you photograph 30 images of a story in series, too repetitive. “I think you can skip the before, after and in between. This is for me photography, the art of using just one frame.”Russian Fairytales by Frank Herfort will be published by Kerber Verlag (£36) later this spring"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f10d72620cdaed382fdbf1dfc5935002b7df77d2/0_398_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b30841904599fcd88fd0da18ff1d007","title":"coronavirus museum historians document pandemic new york historical society","story":"The New-York Historical Society has started collecting artifacts for a collection aimed at teaching future generations about the current crisisShortly after the 911 attacks in New York City, a museum on the Upper West Side, the New-York Historical Society, began collecting items from the tragedy – from scraps of the World Trade Center to public signage, letters and firefighter helmets.“There was little time to collect the debris that was littering downtown streets – trash to some, but treasure to us,” said the museum’s former president Kenneth T Jackson.Now, they’re turning to the coronavirus pandemic to build on their History Responds collection. The museum is collecting ephemera, photographs and personal items from New Yorkers that detail the current crisis.“This is a history that everyone will be looking back on,” said Margi Hofer, museum director. “We hope people will be able to learn from it and be better prepared in an event like this in the future. To be better prepared to cope, as well.”The coronavirus collection follows in the same vein as their 911 collection, which includes objects, images and stories connected to the people of New York, and the world. In the case of the coronavirus, there will be a focus on health and medicine, household items, life under quarantine and social distancing. They’re also planning to feature new product design in relation to the virus, as well as public art and community projects.“We started collecting mid-March,” said Hofer. “We were already alert to what items might be potential for collecting – hand sanitizer, masks, gloves – now evolved to a bigger story than we’ve imagined.”Among the items they have already collected, there is a photo of Alan Balicki, one of the museum’s conservators, seated at a sewing machine making fabric face masks. “It taps into the variety and creativity of DIY face masks, which will be an interesting angle to explore down the road,” said Hofer.While closed business signs across the city of New York each have their own special slogan (many starting with “Dear customers”), a photo of one business sign here reads: “Sky Locksmith will give away a pair of disposable gloves for free if you cannot afford to buy one.”There are also shots of empty New York streets taken by photographer Stephen Harmon. One shows an empty Columbus Circle dated 28 March, another is a shot of a building being sanitized by workers wearing hazmat suits.“Our photo curator is in touch with street photographers who are ready to provide photos of topics that are of interest,” said Hofer. “People in protective gear, whatever they witness that tells the story of what it’s like to be in New York at this time.”It’s more than just photos, however. Among the objects, there will be an emphasis on creativity throughout the crisis – and how art-making has surged under quarantine.“We don’t want anyone risking their lives on our behalf,” she added, “but there are a lot of people documenting what’s going on in the street.”Among the objects, there is a painted rock that reads “This Too Shall Pass”, as well as children’s paintings of rainbows. “We will be looking for objects that can help tell the story of how New Yorkers and people in the surrounding area are managing life and coping under these extraordinary circumstances,” said Rebecca Klassen, one of the museum’s associate curators (one photo she spotted online was hand sanitizer bearing the caption “Liquid Gold”).Klassen mentioned the range of objects that could make their way into the collection from creative personal protective equipment, such as plastic Yoda Halloween masks worn on the subway, to smart thermometers, which transmit data in real time to spot high-risk areas.“We curators are grappling with the whiplash right along with everyone else,” added Klassen. “Our conversations are evolving as we observe how the crisis is unfolding, and how that is being reflected in artifacts.”In 2001, the museum’s curators made visits to ground zero, as well as to shrines across the city. “We knew if we didn’t act quickly, the evidence would be gone,” said Hofer. “We collected thousands of items.” (Today, the 911 Memorial has more than 450 objects in their permanent collection from the museum.)But lifting found objects from the streets and donating them to the collection won’t be as straightforward. “We will be seeking professional guidance, but it isn’t clear at this point how long we need to wait before handling items,” said Hofer.It makes sense, then, that the submissions process will purely be digital, for safety reasons. “For the most part, we’re telling people to hold on to things and we’ll collect them when the time is right.”One thing they’re interested in is the stories of medical professionals, healthcare professionals, hospitals and their equipment. “We have reached out to some hospitals to let them know we’d like to document their stories when there is time,” she said.For now, they’re collecting children’s artwork and digital photos, “things that represent lives”, she said. “In one case, we have a chart of a child’s daily schedule. Art, too, as there is so much creativity happening. As people are stuck at home – it shows how people can quell their anxiety and stay busy.”The society, which started in 1804, has a history of social documentation.“Our founders lived through the British occupation and American revolution,” said Hofer. “They were interested in preserving documents of that time, things were quickly disappearing. Without preserving them, we wouldn’t have our history.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/010ee661e7492c2eef19886e8b8d80aa5acf8a40/0_163_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e1098349cb5dffb4ee34843e618eb88","title":"supermarket staff workers tell us coronavirus affected your work","story":"Are you under extra pressure?

Initially, the Dublin-based carrier had said it would process refunds within 20 working days but soon started back-tracking. According to the travel industry’s own estimates, up to £7bn could be owed for cancelled trips. However, industry bodies such as Iata, for airlines, and Abta, for travel firms, say firms would be bankrupted by repaying now as they are receiving no booking revenue.Confidence in booking is likely to have plunged further since the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said on Friday that he would not book a summer holiday now. The Foreign Office has advised against non-essential foreign travel indefinitely.Which?, the consumer association, said 20 of the UK’s biggest biggest travel operators and airlines were breaking the law by not repaying money promptly. It has received thousands of complaints and requests for help from people struggling to secure refunds for cancelled trips, and said vouchers or credit notes could prove worthless if firms collapsed.Thousands of passengers left stranded abroad by cancelled flights are not being told that they are entitled to their rerouting costs, consumer groups have warned.Normally when an airline starts cancelling, passengers are entitled to EU compensation of €250-€600 (£230-£550). However, where the cancellation is deemed to be an “extraordinary circumstance” – something outside the airline’s control, such as coronavirus – then the rules do not apply.However, passengers stranded abroad by the cancellation in the EU – or due to travel home on an EU carrier – are entitled to rerouting, or to have their alternative travel costs refunded.Thousands of air passengers have found themselves on the wrong side of cancellations – particularly in Spain but also in places such as Morocco and Poland. If your flight is cancelled, passengers can ask the airline to be rerouted on to an alternative flight, if that is possible, or to pay for a train or coach replacement.This applies all flights that start in the UK, EU, Iceland, Norway or Switzerland or flights that arrive in these countries if you are flying on a UKEU-based airline.The airline does not have to pay if the passenger chooses instead to receive a refund of the return flight’s cost. If it is possible to get home, passengers are advised to take the rerouting option. Passengers making their own way home should keep all receipts and keep accommodation and other costs “reasonable”.In practical terms, passengers are having to fend for themselves, as it is all but impossible to get hold of airlines. Passengers trying to call British Airways on Friday described how it was impossible to talk to anyone – and that was before Donald Trump extended the US flight ban to include the UK and Ireland.The bigger problem may well be getting the airlines to pay up. They have been reluctant to pay rerouting costs in normal times, let alone in the current climate. Ultimately, it remains to be seen whether they will still be in business to pay out, given that many are saying they are unlikely to survive without state help.As a result, some travellers will likely find themselves relying on travel insurance, where their policy allows for travel disruption.This is mostly offered by better, more expensive policies. Where the passenger used their credit card to book the flight – directly – with the airline, they may be able to hold their card provider responsible for their extra travel costs – if the flight costs more than £100 – and the airline refuses to pay.Ultimately, the UK government may have to step in to repatriate large numbers of Britons stuck in places such as the Canary Islands or Morocco, where alternative travel is near impossible.Passengers on package tours are better protected. Ski customers in France on package trips should be repatriated by the tour operator – and if the firm ceases to exist because it goes bust, the Civil Aviation Authority. The CAA would have to fund emergency repatriation flights, under the terms of the Atol protection. It is a similar story for any cruise passengers stuck abroad.Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, said: “This is a difficult time for travel operators and airlines but too many people are being given no information at all or poor advice that could risk them being left hundreds of pounds out of pocket. Airlines and operators must ensure they are informing customers of how they will get people home and, where appropriate, how they can claim for additional costs they’ve incurred, such as overnight accommodation.”However, it backed travel industry calls for the government to intervene, recognising that firms were under “unprecedented strain” and could go out of business should they process refunds immediately.While Which? said consumers’ legal right to cash refunds should be protected, it recommended extending the processing deadline to 28 days, and for any vouchers to be guaranteed against insolvency and eventually redeemable for cash. It also called for a definitive timescale for Foreign Office travel warnings, and transparent travel insurance terms and conditions, to help restore confidence.Which? researchers found 10 of the UK’s biggest holiday companies, including Love Holidays and Tui, are not offering full refunds within the legal limit of 14 days, with some only offering customers the choice of rebooking or a voucher. Some are withholding the air ticket price until received from the carrier.It also found almost all airlines are failing to refund passengers on time, with many customers unable to reach call centres to process complaints.Some carriers, such as Air France and KLM, have refused to offer refunds before a 12-month period has elapsed, issuing credit notes or allowing rebooking instead. Which? said it was “a fair solution and a reasonable balance between the protection of their passengers and the operational realities that every airline has to face”.Passengers booking with carriers including easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways have told the  they have been unable to obtain refunds. Ryanair has issued vouchers and told customers requesting refunds that they are in queue. BA and easyJet customers have complained that call centre numbers are not being answered.A spokesperson for Airlines UK said: “Airlines are facing unprecedented challenges keeping vital routes open to repatriate stranded British travellers and transport critical medical supplies and PPE as part of cargo operations. Carriers are facing a far longer than usual volume of refund claims to get through and the current restrictions imposed nationally mean they are not able to bring in additional staff to deal with them. We are thankful to passengers for their continued patience.”Rory Boland, of Which? Travel, said: “We do not want to see the industry suffer further as a result of this outbreak, but it cannot be on consumers to prop up airlines and travel firms, especially when so many will be in difficult financial situations of their own.“The government must urgently set out how it will support travel firms and airlines to ensure they can meet their legal obligations to refund customers for cancelled travel plans, and avoid permanent damage to trust and confidence in the travel industry.”Some governments have already amended consumer legislation to allow deferred refunds, after calls from the airline body Iata. The Iata director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said earlier this month that refunding was “almost unbearable, financially speaking”, adding that airlines were “perfectly conscious of the difficulty for the passenger … but it is a matter of survival”.Abta said tour operators were being squeezed by refund requests for money that had been paid to suppliers, such as airlines and hotels, and not returned. Its chief executive, Mark Tanzer, said: “The UK government, despite repeated requests, has failed to recognise and respond to this reality, in stark contrast to the clear sensible actions taken by the European commission and many countries throughout Europe.“We fully understand and sympathise with the frustration that many customers may be feeling. But if companies are forced into bankruptcy, it will not only destroy livelihoods but extend the refund delays far beyond the term of refund credit notes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd2550cfdaea6be71f94fc7fa2bf81b7d3961005/0_382_5760_3458/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e921dfb2ba6d66d87ff8ac0fa10c49b","title":"corner shops describe life under lockdown as they stay open for their community","story":"Change in buying habits means many small shops are struggling to survive, while some are hit by shopliftersSome are doing home deliveries for the first time and tell of a heightened sense of caring in the community others tell of a rise in shoplifting, staff being spat at and a devastating collapse in grocery sales.As a third independent retailer dies from Covid-19, owners of corner shops across the UK tell the  about just how hard it is to cope in the pandemic.All of them are considered key workers, but they don’t have the support of retail giant owners who can offer personal protective equipment (PPE), screens, security staff or financial support when sales plummet.Yet they have one thing in common: a determination to stay open and keep serving their communities.Mohammed Faz, of Ashley’s News on Beehive Lane, has been a beacon of light for the community he serves. He is stocking yeast for the first time ever – “everyone is baking now” – though his initial offer of sanitiser and masks wasn’t successful.His store is quiet but he detected a change in custom overnight. “This community is older, people are not going up to the big shops, they can come in here, it’s safe and they know there are only one or two people in the shop at a time. So people are spending £100, £200,” he says.“They are buying everything here, toiletries, food, alcohol. They don’t want to go to the supermarkets because they don’t think they are safe.”Richard Inglis runs three shops in Southampton but has already closed one after sales plummeted from £30,000 a week to £5,000 in just five days. His staff have been abused, and he has been spat at by shoplifters. Inglis says small shops can’t afford the security personnel hired by the big supermarket chains.Over the past few weeks, a small group of drug users and street drinkers have started to hang round the front of his shop in front of the railway station daily. And they have become more sophisticated in their approach, he says.“Before, they used to come on their own, now they are coming in in teams wearing face masks, disguising their identity, and they will split up around the shop, grab whatever they can and make a dash for it. It’s worrying for my staff who have got anxieties about the virus and then these people in swearing and threatening to spit at you,” he said.“I got spat at in the face along with two of my staff by a woman the other week. She’s still on the streets. The police came and she was arrested but she was released on bail,” he explained. “The reality is if you shoplift, the biggest risk is you might be detained for 24 hours.”Omar Afzal runs the Shopsmart convenience store and post office on Saracen Street, north Glasgow and explains how people locally have adapted to the crisis.He and his staff now wear PPE, and customers take their own precautions, such as handing over their bank card in a sealed plastic bag so they can disinfect it when they get home.“It’s a very benefit-dependent area so people have not had a big shock to their income like other places. We didn’t get panic-buying here, I think that was more of a middle-class thing,” Afzal says.Like other similar shops, he adds: “We’ve seen a huge reduction in customer numbers but they tend to buy much more to keep them going.”He has now reduced the number of customers in the shop to three at a time, where they can browse three aisles selling everything from muesli to wrapping paper. People are buying more magazines and puzzle books now, as well as more vouchers for online gaming since the bookies closed.The mood of shoppers is usually good-humoured, he adds. “In an area like this it’s tough for people cooped up in flats and that can have an effect on mental health, so when people come out to the shop it’s a change of scenery, especially for children.“There’s a perception that we’re staying open for the money, but we’re key workers and we have a sense of responsibility. We are financially invested in the area but also emotionally. I’ve been here for 20 years and have seen people grow up.”Ankit Patel has recently taken over this small convenience store close to the Kingsmead Estate in London. At the outset of the lockdown he had considered closing, but felt it was important to stay open so locals could continue to top up their Oyster travel cards and use the Payzone to pay their bills.Sales have collapsed in the past few weeks, however, and he struggles to make ends meet. “We used to do 200-250 transactions a day. We’ve been open since 7am and it’s now 12.30am and we’ve had 21 transactions,” he told the  last week, checking the till.Patel blames panicked stockpiling last month. “People were panicking and they still have these things in their house, so they are only coming in here for milk and food,” he said.He is also witnessing hardship, with some customers offering to sell their phones and stolen goods. “We have people coming in to sell goods they have stolen from other shops, from supermarkets, not just groceries but things like jackets, bags,” he said.“Yesterday we had six or seven people in trying to sell their phones because they have run out of money. These are our regular customers. People are struggling, especially people who had temporary zero-hours jobs, or some people who… are also carers for elderly or sick people and they have no job, they are desperate.”Patel added that he was giving hard-up cases “a bit of credit” because he feels for them and he is part of the community.Bettyhill’s General Merchants is the only shop left open in the remote village of about 800 inhabitants on Scotland’s far north coast.Perched above the spectacular dunes of Torrisdale Bay, the road outside is eerily quiet. The shop is on the A836, on the most northerly section of the popular North Coast 500 touring route, but for now traffic is occasional and local.The owner of the convenience store and petrol station, Peter Malone, says he is still struggling to stock paracetamol after initial panic-buying. While locals still rely on the shop rather than making the 80-mile (130km) round trip to the nearest supermarket in Thurso, trade is down without the tourists. He is selling fewer sweets with no children dropping in after school, and local crofters are busy with lambing. But sales of butcher meat, bakery and milk are holding up.He has seen a significant increase in demand for home delivery. Last Friday he made 16, compared with the usual three or four before the weekend. “We knock the door and leave the shopping outside. Older people might want some help carrying it, so we take it into their kitchen and clean behind us on the way out.”Malone is used to the shop acting as a community hub, but this is made all the more apparent now in a village with a significant proportion of older residents. “It was always the case that we were the centre point, and people will tell us things that we then pass on. The mood in Bettyhill is fairly positive, most people are quite happy that we need to be in lockdown to protect the older population.”Lola Otuagomah is gazing out of the large window in a blue mask watching the near-empty buses go by. His is a destination shop for African food lovers and most, he says, are now too afraid to take the bus to get to him.He points to the shelves of plastic containers of freshly cooked food including Waakye, fresh moin-moin, jollof rice and pepper soup. “Usually these are already gone by now. I have only sold one today.”He is also afraid he will run out of stock as the lockdowns have meant supplies are not coming in of specialist milled grains, beans and nuts. “If the borders don’t open again it will be very, very difficult,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8cc1c56b823aa0b323cf219744ab1c01e67452/0_60_3300_1982/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d83c311e159d7156eb79167bb35b863","title":"briton no 10 leadership power vacuum coronavirus","story":"With a power vacuum in Westminster, devolved leaders such as Nicola Sturgeon are already voicing dissent on vital coronavirus issuesShould we all be wearing masks to go out in public? Sadiq Khan, London’s Mayor, publicly broke ranks last week to argue for compulsory face-covering on public transport and as I write, the government’s scientific advisers are re-reviewing the pros and cons after Germany and the US started recommending masks for ordinary members of the public.Fears remain that a run on masks could either leave NHS workers dangerously short of them or make wearers overconfident, if they don’t realise that mask-wearing is about trying to protect other people rather than yourself. But look around your nearest supermarket to see how many people are no longer waiting for ministers to make their minds up at the weekend, I spotted everything from strategically positioned scarves to cycling kit, builders’ dust masks and home-stitched floral numbers. Whatever the experts conclude, Khan seems to be going with the grain of public instinct, and if the advice does ultimately change then he’ll have left government looking slow-footed even if it has hesitated for the best of reasons. (Ministers are taking their lead from the World Health Organization, which still isn’t recommending masks for general public use.)But this isn’t just about masks. The inevitable leadership vacuum created by Boris Johnson’s illness is starting to be filled less by ambitious lieutenants – although the news of an anonymous Downing Street source briefing against Matt Hancock’s promise of 100,000 tests a day suggests things are getting alarmingly fractious – than by emboldened devolved leaders. Nicola Sturgeon has already warned Scotland won’t necessarily follow whatever path Johnson eventually sets out of lockdown, promising to treat Scots like “the grownups you are” by laying out her own personal thinking this week. (The echo of Angela Merkel, praised for providing detailed explanations of the science underpinning her decisions rather than fobbing off tough questions with invocations of Dunkirk spirit, is surely deliberate.) Even Wales’s first minister Mark Drakeford, while worrying that it would be harder to enforce lockdown rules that varied across the country, has said he would “do things differently” in Wales if necessary. If Downing Street tries to lift the lockdown too quickly, it could trigger a constitutional showdown like that unfolding in the US, where inidual state governors have chosen to protect their citizens by defying Donald Trump’s attempts to reopen the economy. And while it’s one thing brushing off questions about why Britain isn’t doing what South Korea is doing, it’s quite another explaining why Scotland appears to have no confidence in your strategy.A cynic might say all this is dangerous game-playing by Labour and SNP politicians facing elections next spring, who won’t want to be seen as having blindly followed in Westminster’s footsteps if by then the public mood has turned. (For now, polling shows voters are still more supportive of this government’s handling of the epidemic than the left likes to think, although with doubts creeping in about NHS workers being properly protected from the virus the failure of a much-vaunted big shipment of protective equipment from Turkey to materialise forms part of a bigger worrying pattern of overpromising and underdelivering.) It does the Scottish nationalist cause in particular no harm for Sturgeon to emerge looking like a plausible alternative to Westminster leadership in a crisis.But you can’t devolve education and health policy and then expect devolved governments not to use their powers in a once-in-a-generation emergency, and nor can practical differences to everyday lives be ignored. Talking about schools possibly starting to come back in July, fitting in a few weeks’ teaching before the holidays, makes sense in England but not in Scotland where schools break up at the end of June. Masks could well give city-dwellers confidence about getting back on the Tube, but would the balance of risks and benefits be the same in sparsely populated rural areas where most people drive to work?Half the point of devolution was to acknowledge that what works for one part of the union doesn’t always work everywhere, and to manage the resulting tensions. But when the centre starts to falter, looking uncertain or ided, it’s in the nature of politics that rival power bases will grow. If Downing Street doesn’t get a grip, the next public spat may be about something more fundamental than a piece of cloth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2270d2facb8f151192b993bc5987e6696a9fa37/0_202_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5848fa9b2503cd5780c3f29d2a57a59b","title":"flattening curve new zealand coronavirus","story":"Countries that are actively working to contain coronavirus are buying themselves time to deal with its uncertain outcomes As Sars-CoV-2 has spread across the world, some countries have reacted with alarm and thorough preparations, given their previous experiences with Mers or Sars. In these countries, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam, containment of the novel coronavirus became the imperative, regardless of cost. However, other countries chose to treat it like a bad flu strain that would be unstoppable and spread across the population until some kind of immunity was reached.Much of the difference in countries’ initial responses can be attributed to whether they “overreacted”, given prior experience with two other more deadly coronaviruses, or whether they perceived the novel coronavirus from the start as just posing a moderate to low risk to their populations and eventually becoming endemic.In the UK, the assumption until quite recently had seemed to be the latter. The containment phase ended on 12 March. At this point, testing ended for all those with minor symptoms (including frontline health staff), contact tracing stopped, airports remained open without checks on incoming flights or passengers, and physical distancing measures were ruled out. Large events involving tens of thousands of people went ahead a few days later, and non-essential travel continued. After considerable public pressure, lockdown measures were introduced on 23 March with the goal of keeping the coronavirus-related burden on health services within NHS capacity.Where are we now? According to official figures, 16,509 people with Covid-19 have so far died in British hospitals. There are no official statistics for deaths in the community, but ONS data released today shows that of 6,200 Covid-19-related deaths in the week to 10 April, one in six of them happened outside hospital. We are on track for 40,000 deaths by just the end of the first wave of this outbreak, while also having to cope with the astronomical economic costs and heart-rending social implications of being in lockdown for weeks on end.In a significant number of confirmed Covid cases, the health outcomes are severe, the disease can result in multiple organ failure and long-term lung damage, and the clinical need of patients for oxygen, ICU care and ventilators is much higher. Early clinical management of symptoms, to which Boris Johnson had access, means that outcomes are generally better, but that requires testing at an early stage of the disease.New Zealand is in the enviable position of having fewer than 20 deaths, while Australia has managed to stay under 100. With early physical distancing measures and border control, and aggressive testing, tracing and isolating procedures in place, these countries are in a better position to ease lockdown earlier and get their economy and society going again, while keeping Covid-19-related deaths low. That’s as close to a win-win situation as a government can have right now.However, when these international comparisons are made, some in government say that it is still too early to say how countries are performing, and others say that all countries will be in the same place, and any variation will depend on their healthcare capacity. It is worth thinking through the long-term scenarios for the future of Covid-19.The first scenario: if we have an effective, safe and available vaccine or antiviral in the next 18 months, the countries that minimised loss of life with the least harsh economic restrictions will be in the best position. Australia, New Zealand and numerous east Asian countries have the outbreak under control and can in the short term manage the trickle of cases while waiting for the scientific solution.The second scenario: in the absence of a vaccine or antiviral, some kind of population immunity will be built up so that the virus is not actively transmitting at a high level. This assumes that having the coronavirus leads to immunity for at least two or three years and that subsequent reinfection is mild. Even in this situation, the countries with low numbers of cases can wait for ongoing research on better identification of who is exactly “vulnerable” to developing severe symptoms, and shield these iniduals so the burden on ICU care and loss of life are kept to a minimum. While we have some basic idea at population level about who is vulnerable, based on age and pre-existing conditions, scientists do not understand the inidual genetic or immunological factors yet.The third (worst-case) scenario: research might find that there is no lasting immunity to the virus, or in fact immune enhancement, which means subsequent reinfections would be more severe (similar to dengue). This creates a real case for countries with the capacity to eliminate the virus and keep in place border controls . Obviously the fewer cases present, the easier it is to eliminate a virus, and in this situation a precautionary approach to letting it spread through the population would have been well warranted.In short, there are huge gaps in what we know about this virus, including about immunity, about the possibility and timeline for a vaccine or antiviral therapy, about who exactly is vulnerable, and about long-term health implications. For example, Italian scientists have warned that some patients are developing Guillain-Barré syndrome (temporary paralysis) as a side effect of Covid-19.In this uncertainty, countries that are actively working to contain this virus and keep numbers as low as possible are buying time to build a more informed policy response while also protecting their economies and societies. Others, by letting the virus spread slowly through their populations (only flattening the curve instead of completely stopping the spread), are just gambling with people’s lives, and will be caught in cycles of lockdownrelease that will destroy the economy and cause social unrest, as well as increased Covid-19- and non-Covid-19-related deaths.• Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cd1af128aae1c5b5f52593944bf8248aeb9f701/2_0_1260_756/master/1260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e6e6572474177521345827208e45f7f","title":"whats the deal with the coronavirus tracing app cassandra the information technology wobbegong explains","story":"If you are even slightly concerned about your privacy you simply must not let this government anywhere near your phone"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/637c8d857189d0b26f8229f506ea4049f4cb2bbb/0_420_4237_2542/master/4237.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e94a4821394c2b105059121a85b95a49","title":"the good place star jameela jamil on controversy and coming out","story":"The star of The Good Place is adored and vilified for speaking out. She talks about attention-seeking, body hair, Twitter feuds with Piers Morgan – and why no one should ever shake hands againWere she another kind of person, Jameela Jamil would have an easy life. Everything seemed to be going her way. First came the break that led to a job presenting Channel 4’s Saturday morning hangover slot, T4, which was followed by a job on Radio 1, before a swift, and unexpected, move to become an actor on the hit US sitcom The Good Place. Yet barely a month goes by without Jamil popping up to ignite some controversy or inflame the kind of commentator incensed by any hint of perceived “wokeness”.February was a particularly difficult month. First, she came out as queer, which appeared to infuriate many people. Then she had to defend herself against accusations she had Munchausen’s syndrome – a psychiatric disorder in which people feign illness – an allegation started by a writer who didn’t believe her history of health problems. She ended the month embroiled in a Twitter row with Piers Morgan (public feuds being something of a natural stomping ground for both) after the death of TV presenter Caroline Flack.Does Jamil ever feel like living a quieter life? “It’s not an easy path,” she says. “You get hurled up on to a pedestal and it always feels a bit like a trap – it’s very high, it’s easy to slip off and it’s a long way down. I’m just learning, I’m not the authority on anything.” She has not, she says, “handled myself perfectly at all times, but I am a human, prone to error”.We talk on the phone, with Jamil calling from her home in Los Angeles, which she shares with her boyfriend, the musician James Blake and three friends. The lockdown has not been too difficult, she says. “I couldn’t feel more privileged right now. I’m safe, I have a house. I can afford to not work for a while and I have my health,” she says.“On a more frivolous note, I’m really happy that handshaking is kind of cancelled for ever.” It has always appalled her, she says, and her explanation is something I have never considered before and will never be able to forget. “The fact you know that a hand has been on a dick at some point before touching your hand is deeply unsettling,” she says with a laugh, going on to describe it as “a sort of penile imprint upon your palm”. She has always succumbed to polite convention when someone puts their hand out. “Never again.”She is excited, too, about the possible return of women’s body hair, saying that “we’re coming out of this furrier, chubbier, spottier and hopefully alive. And that’s great – we are the lucky ones.” Might it mark the end of the ridiculous grooming ideals (the lip fillers, the weirdly immaculate eyebrows)? “For women who have transitioned, I think not having access to aestheticians is really difficult. But I think some women are becoming used to seeing their faces without makeup, and realising that you don’t need all of the nonsense that we have flogged at us.”She has a new podcast, which started at the beginning of the month, and she will soon launch a YouTube show. (“Is there anything sadder than a 34-year-old trying to start a YouTube channel?” she laughs.) Both come under her I Weigh movement, a campaign that started on Instagram in 2018 to promote the idea that people, especially women, should be “weighed” by their achievements rather than the number on their bathroom scales – and to promote inclusivity, social justice and mental health. If her guests seem to open up, it is probably because Jamil herself is incredibly candid. In the episode with Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general of the US and author of Together, a book about loneliness, Jamil talks about trying to kill herself at 26. In other episodes, she talks about the eating disorder she had as a teenager. It is almost easy to see why the conspiracy theory that she has Munchausen’s syndrome took off she has been through so much, almost too much for one person.She attended an independent girls’ school in London (on a scholarship she and her brother were mostly brought up by their mother, a school secretary) where she says she was the victim of racist bullying that was physical and violent. She was abused as a child, and was later the victim of several sexual assaults. She has said she has been raped several times. At 17, she was hit by a car, severely damaging her spine, and spent more than a year recovering. Mental illness led to the attempt to kill herself in her mid-20s, at which point she sought therapy. She also went through several painful operations as a child to deal with hearing loss, and has coeliac disease and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which affects the body’s connective tissues.She had not come out before “because I was worried that people would think I was jumping on a trendy bandwagon. And various other reasons. So I understand the pushback.” What she didn’t understand, she says, were the claims she was a liar. “What a weird lie,” she says with a laugh. “It doesn’t help to identify yourself in any way in an industry that still discriminates against people. But the rest of it, I understood. That’s why I didn’t come back complaining.”The same criticisms around appropriation have surrounded Jamil’s campaigning on body image when she herself is slim and conventionally beautiful. She has been accused of shaming other women – most damagingly black women, such as the rapper CupcakKe (after the entertainer announced she had been on a 40-day “water fast”) without acknowledging that the policing of black women’s bodies comes with its own painful history. There have also been accusations she has adopted the words and ideas of others, such as the writer Stephanie Yeboah. Her brand of feminism has been described as “exclusionary … and toxic” by the writer Danielle Dash.Jamil has always said she is constantly learning, and readily admits to her own mistakes and gaps in her knowledge. (In October, for instance, she explained she knew little about George W Bush’s presidency after being embroiled in another Twitter row.) Using her platform, particularly as one of the most high-profile women of south Asian heritage in the western media, puts her in a tricky position. Does she speak out about airbrushing and start feuds with the Kardashians over the diet products they promote – and risk making mistakes – or keep quiet? “I’ve asked repeatedly for magazines to put me on the cover with women of different body shapes, and with disabilities, and they say no. So either no one has the conversation or I do the photoshoot by myself because then at least the conversation gets had.” People have been impatient, she says her YouTube show will provide a platform for other activists. “You have to take hold of the mic first before you can pass it,” she says.Jamil is so isive, seemingly equally championed by those who like her openness and sense of humour (she is not an earnest sort of activist), and vilified by those who think she is endlessly virtue-signalling for her own gain. Blake sometimes steps in. (After the Munchausen’s rumour went viral, he posted: “It’s pretty disgusting to watch the woman I love just be dog piled on every day.”) Would she rather he didn’t? She laughs. “I don’t want it to impair his career in any way just because I’m in a controversy. But it must be difficult to see people hurt someone you love. I’m very lucky to have someone this diehard in my corner.”They had not really spoken “just because of what had been going on”, says Jamil (in October, Jamil had criticised a cosmetic surgery show Flack would be presenting). “She reached out to me with a message of such love, and she passed away that week.” The next week, Piers Morgan posted text messages from Flack on Twitter, sent to him last year saying she was “struggling” with Jamil, “as if I was any contribution to her passing, when I’d never instigated any kind of argument with Caroline. I don’t criticise the host, I criticise the show.” She says she didn’t publish Flack’s last message to her “because I’m not a scumbag”.Ultimately, she says, she will not shut up. Outspoken women, and especially outspoken women of colour, are disproportionately attacked online. “That isn’t just about the woman they are vilifying,” says Jamil. “It’s also a deliberate message they are sending out to all other women to not speak out, to not stand for something, to not break the rules. And that’s why I can’t back down now, because otherwise it would say that it wasn’t worth it and that I shouldn’t have stuck my neck out.”But it was her breakdown in her mid-20s that became the bigger pivotal moment. “After that, I realised it was very much do or die, and I had to investigate everything that had led me to such a low point,” she says. “One of those things was shame. You place the blame upon yourself, especially when you’re very young. But also just shame for being a woman. You’re too skinny, you’re too fat, you’re not smart enough or you’re too smart. I completely accept my own fuck-ups, but a lot of things that have caused a lot of trauma are not my fault.”That’s why she does what she does, she says – the social-media posts that sometimes strike the wrong note, the fights, the campaigns. “Important conversations feel uncomfortable. And therefore we leave young people unarmed.” She would like to work on syllabuses for schools “so that we don’t learn more about igneous rock than we learn about consent, eating disorders and the lies of social media”.What next for Jamil? She has built up a large social-media following and something of a power base. If it is to further her acting career, constantly criticising many aspects of the entertainment industry would be a funny way of going about it. So no nice, easy life for her. “I would do certain things differently,” she says. “I would rather start the fights that I start and sometimes get into the trouble that I get into than sit here silently and be complicit in an industry that pumps so much toxicity into the world.” She understands some people’s wariness of her, she says. “I look like the enemy. I’m a slim, privileged person who exists within this industry I totally get the mistrust. I will just have to do the work to prove I wasn’t such a shitbag after all. I’m not doing this for popularity. I’m doing this so that I can undo the stuff that I saw when I was younger, that made me unwell, and try to change it.”There is a smile in her voice as she says: “And sometimes you have to be annoying and attention-seeking in order to instigate that change.”• Jameela Jamil’s I Weigh podcast is hosted at www.earwolf"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/319f3e1f1aa73aea3f05f80bb8ae2f687c4d2de6/0_289_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07f474b6b59c27a455cc1f6b3689d246","title":"climate strikes continue online we want to keep the momentum going","story":"Activists hold mass video calls and share hashtags, and three-day livestream planned for Earth DayThe large crowds and brightly coloured placards of the school climate strikes became some of the defining images of 2019.“There would be lots of chanting and the energy was always amazing,” says Dominique Palmer, a 20-year-old climate activist from London who has been involved with the strikes for more than a year. “Being there with everyone in that moment is truly an electrifying feeling. It’s very different now.”The coronavirus pandemic has put a stop to large gatherings of people the world over, and the climate strikers have had to change their tactics. Now, instead of big crowds they hold mass video calls, and instead of marching with banners and placards they post photos with hashtags.“We’ve started digital striking because we want to keep the momentum going, so that when the pandemic is contained we still have that energy and we can go back on to the streets,” says Palmer.Every Friday, the strikers post photos of themselves holding a sign with a message about the climate crisis along with #DigitalStrike or #ClimateStrikeOnline, and they congregate in large Zoom calls, often with more than 100 people.“It’s the greatest call but also the most chaotic call you could ever imagine,” says Rikke Nielsen, 19, from Denmark. “Sometimes people bring animals one time someone was playing the saxophone.”The calls are giving the strikers a unique opportunity to connect with people they would not normally get the chance to meet. “I think we will start to see more of an international perspective in every country because of this,” says Nielsen.The digital strikes are not the only online climate activism. In the US, groups are preparing a three-day livestream to mark Earth Day, an annual event celebrated around the world on 22 April to demonstrate support for protecting the environment.Wednesday marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, when people around the world had been expected to mobilise to highlight the climate and ecological emergency.But the global lockdown has meant traditional protests and marches are impossible. Organisers say the 50th anniversary will be the first digital Earth Day with three days of online activism and a “a collective call for transformative action for our planet”.Among the events being planned are an global live stream bringing together youth and adult activists, celebrities and politicians including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Al Gore, Jane Fonda, and Joaquin Phoenix.On Thursday, as part of the Earth Day celebrations, the 350.org campaign group together with the Stop the Money Pipeline will hold online debates and talks highlighting how the fossil fuel industry is financed and outlining how people can take action against the largest financial backers like Chase bank and Barclays.Fridays For Future (FFF) is gearing up for a 24-hour livestream on 24 April to showcase strikers around the globe, and is hosting a regular weekly webinar, Talks for Future, which features climate scientists and other experts.Activists are also using the digital strikes to create Twitter storms, bombarding companies and people in power with tweets at a set time. Last month, FFF Digital and the Polluters Out campaign teamed up to target Shell and the Adani Group, demanding a stop to new fossil fuel projects.This new reliance on social media has created challenges and opportunities. For Leah Namugerwa, a 15-year old striker from Kampala, it has allowed her to better promote her online petition for Uganda to ban plastic bags, but it has also made it difficult for her to reach people. “My activism and message targets policymakers and people in power, but social media in Uganda isn’t widely used, especially by elder people in positions of power,” she says.“Striking before the virus was more challenging because I skipped school every Friday, missed classes, had to make up for them later and stood for a few hours in cold weather. My persistence to strike at a different location each week made it even harder. This feels a bit like vacation.”Dylan Hamilton, 15, from Linlithgow in Scotland, has dabbled with the video platform TikTok as a means of connecting with other young people. “I think it’s quite a good way of getting people involved. And also, we are just teenagers, so it’s nice to be a normal teenager and communicate with other teenagers that way.”While the activists are embracing the potential for social media to help them get their message across in new ways, most agree they cannot wait to return to traditional on-the-ground campaigning.“We are more present on the streets, and we know it’s not a social media bubble – we’re reaching every single person that walks by us, not just the people who are already worried about the climate crisis,” Nielsen says.As the pandemic dominates headlines, the climate movement is trying to strike a difficult balance between continuing to stress the urgency of its cause while allowing space for coronavirus to take priority.“It’s very important to keep talking about climate change, but we also get that we need to focus on the coronavirus,” says Hamilton. “We know that you can’t do everything all at once.”There is concern that the climate crisis could be sidelined for months if not longer, and that interest in climate strikes could dwindle – not least because the rebellious act of striking from school is not as powerful when schools are closed.“We’ve lost a bit of motivation,” Hamilton adds. “We don’t know when we’re going to be able to do the big protests again.”But there is still cause for optimism. Many hope a break from continuous campaigning might bring activists back stronger, while among the tragedy of the pandemic the world has shown at least that it can change.“Seeing how things shifted so quickly gives us hope,” says Palmer. “When politicians tell us things don’t happen that fast, this is just evidence that it can be done. This was such a rapid response to a crisis. If we also treat the climate crisis like an emergency, like an imminent threat, it is definitely possible for us to achieve the world that we want.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dfac6f2d6f380d1c902bddf117bde7afb8938be/0_4_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5aaf3e9e227702b477c1b365a6208d0","title":"environment pandemic side effects earth day coronavirus","story":"Coronavirus has led to reduced pollution, re-emerging wildlife and plunging oil prices and shown the size of the task facing humanityThe skies are clearing of pollution, wildlife is returning to newly clear waters, a host of flights have been scrapped and crude oil is so worthless that the industry would have to pay you to take it off their hands – a few months ago, environmentalists could only dream of such a scenario as the 50th anniversary of Earth Day hove into view.But this disorientingly green new reality is causing little cheer given the cause is the coronavirus pandemic that has ravaged much of the world.“This isn’t the way we would’ve wanted things to happen, God no,” said Gina McCarthy, former head of the US Environmental Protection Agency in the Obama administration. “This is just a disaster that pointed out the underlying challenges we face. It’s not something to celebrate.”The waters of Venice are now clear, lions lounge on roads normally frequented by safari-goers in South Africa and bears and coyotes wander around empty accommodation in Yosemite national park in California.Meanwhile, nearly eight in 10 flights globally have been canceled, with many planes in the US carrying just a handful of people. The oil industry, a key driver of the climate crisis and direct environmental disaster, is in turmoil, with a barrel of crude hitting an unprecedented minus-$40 on Monday.These would perhaps be the sort of outcomes seen had stringent environmental policies been put in place in the wake of the first Earth Day in 1970, which saw 20 million Americans rally in support of anti-pollution measures.Instead, the pain of the Covid-19 shutdown has highlighted how ponderous the world’s response has been – the expected cut in emissions, for example, is still less than what scientists say is needed every year this decade to avoid disastrous climate impacts for much of the world.“It’s the worst possible way to experience environment improvement and it has also shown us the size of the task,” said Michael Gerrard, an environmental law expert at Columbia University.How people react to the return of normalcy after the pandemic will help define the crises racking the environment, according to Gerrard. “A key question will be do we have a green recovery, do we seize the opportunity to create jobs in renewable energy and in making coastlines more resilient to climate change?” he said. “The current US president clearly has no inclination to do this.”McCarthy, now head of the Natural Resources Defense Council, noted that some Indian people were seeing the Himalayas for the first time due to the veil of air pollution lifting.“You wonder if people will want to go back to what it was like before,” she said. “The pandemic has shown people will change their behavior if it’s for the health of their families. This has been the lost message on climate, that it’s a human problem, not a planetary problem. We have to show you can have a stable environment and your job, too.”The problems in the natural world haven’t suddenly vanished – this week various researchers found that the Arctic is very likely to be free of sea ice in summers before 2050, that the bushfires that torched Australia earlier this year released more carbon than the country’s annual CO2 output and that the first quarter of 2020 was the second-warmest on record.Donald Trump has signaled that he will try to provide a bailout to the US oil and gas industry, with $25bn already handed out by the US government to prop up airlines. In China, it’s not certain that the wildlife-packed “wet markets” where Covid-19 is believed to have originated will be shut down.Conservationists warn that returning the world to its pre-pandemic settings will quickly wipe out any environmental benefits of the shutdown.“It’s a serious wake-up call,” said Thomas Lovejoy, an ecologist who coined the term “biological ersity”. “We bulldoze into the last remaining places in nature and then are surprised when something like this happens. We have done this to ourselves by our continual intrusion into nature. We have to re-chart our course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c80883bdbe3e3a30a2bbc3f5bba26ace40e38b2/0_142_2069_1241/master/2069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1e7549a92514d76e730844bad384c31","title":"new big 5 wildlife photography project in pictures","story":"An international initiative aims to do away with the old big five of wildlife – based on the toughest animals to shoot and kill – and create a new selection based on photography, not hunting.

I thought about Clarkson’s jibe while watching this refreshingly contrarian eco-documentary from environmentalist Jeff Gibbs, which has been uploaded for free online viewing by its executive producer, Michael Moore.All the green, liberal A-listers – Bill McKibben, Al Gore, Van Jones, Robert F Kennedy Jr – are attacked in this film as a pompous and complacent high-priest caste of the environmental movement, who are shilling for a fossil fuel industry that has sneakily taken them over. (Although it should be said that, for all his radical bravado, Gibbs does not dare criticise Thunberg.)Big Oil and its corporate and banking representatives have, according to this film, found a way to rebrand themselves as green or greenish, to use the green movement for their own ends, and to get their mitts on the huge subsidies that taxpayers around the world are handing over to anyone claiming to be developing renewable energy resources, which turn out to be the same old fossil-fuel entities in different packaging.Solar panels and wind turbines? These provide no energy when there is no sun or wind and degrade after only a few decades, says Gibbs. And in any case they need a lot of fossil fuels in their manufacture: silicon, cobalt, silver, graphite, rare earths – and of course coal. The same goes for manufacturing storage batteries. Factories claiming to have gone “beyond coal” again and again turn out to be relying on natural gas. Corporate behemoths such as Apple make spurious claims for their energy usage. But how about the ultra-fashionable new “renewable” energy source: biomass or wood-chips? This is basically a colossal logging industry that requires a lot of fossil fuel energy to harvest and transport the material. As Gibbs’ interviewees point out, you might just as well as burn the fossil fuels in the first place. And it is laying waste rainforests and areas of natural beauty.This, says Gibbs, is the queasy merger of environmentalism and capitalism – and he makes a refreshingly sceptical case. But he takes it further, suggesting that unfettered capitalism and its insanity of eternal growth on a finite planet is also what is leading us to the cliff edge. True enough, although his comments on overpopulation have an unintentionally ironic chime, in the middle of the Covid-19 outbreak.Most chillingly of all, Gibbs at one stage of the film appears to suggest that there is no cure for any of this, that, just as humans are mortal, so the species itself is staring its own mortality in the face. But he appears to back away from that view by the end, saying merely that things need to change. But what things and how?It’s not at all clear. I found myself thinking of Robert Stone’s controversial 2013 documentary Pandora’s Promise, which made a revisionist case for nuclear power: a clean energy source that (allegedly) has cleaned up its act on safety and really can provide for our wholesale energy needs without contributing to climate change, in a way that “renewables” can’t.Gibbs doesn’t mention nuclear and – a little lamely, perhaps – has no clear lesson or moral, other than the need to take a fiercely critical look at the environmental establishment.

But when ingredients are sparse, freshness becomes a prized but much-needed luxury, so here is a list of recipes from my archive to help you make use of your store-cupboard, together with a few vegetables you might find in the shops now. Meera SodhaKA: You can swap out the choi sum for any greens and the sake for dry sherry.Kitchen Aide: This would work with just about any bean, whether tinned or dried (and soaked and cooked first, of course). If allspice is scarce, try a mixture of equal parts ground nutmeg, cinnamon and clove and use parsley (or, indeed, any fresh herb you fancy) instead of the coriander.KA: For when you can’t get to Wagamama… you can sub the panko for normal breadcrumbs and pickle whatever vegetable takes your fancy, if you can’t find radishes.KA: Use any thin pasta in place of the vermicelli orzo would be another option. And if you can’t get green beans, try courgette batons or asparagus instead, though those both need less cooking, or they’ll turn to absolute mush.KA: Sub out purple sprouting broccoli for normal broccoli, brown rice syrup for brown sugar, Thai basil for basil leaves. If you want to keep ginger and Thai chillies for longer, prep and freeze the ginger in portions, and freeze the Thai chillies as they are.KA: Sub the fennel for more broccoli, or even tomatoes (or anything else you have, such as celery, carrots or peppers).KA: If chard proves hard to come by, just use another green instead: mature spinach or savoy cabbage, say, or kale, in which case it will need more cooking – a five-minute blanch and refresh should do it.KA: There are as many variations on the tikki as there are people who eat them – mix and match to suit tastes and availability.KA: No butter, no eggs, no raising agent.

It has appealed not only to the league but to the respective chairmen of the top ision’s clubs, highlighting what is says is a threat their intellectual property – and incomes.Nonetheless sources working on the takeover remain confident there will be no last-minute hitches, hinting that Premier League checks which have been under way for a fortnight are approaching a conclusion. It has also been noted that, despite similar concerns, the Premier League approved Sheffield United’s transfer into full Saudi ownership last year.The Premier League, along with other domestic governing bodies and rights holders, has previously urged Arabsat, the Saudi state satellite broadcaster, to withdraw a framework for a pirate network known as beoutQ that they argued was “abusing” the game.It started its illegal streaming activities in 2017, the year Saudi and Qatar became involved in a significant political argument with assorted international ramifications, and no one has succeeded in halting the transmissions.Last July the Premier League said it had spoken to nine law firms in Saudi Arabia who either refused to act or later recused themselves when asked about pursuing a copyright complaint against beoutQ.“Furthermore – given the crippling economic effect that coronavirus is having on the sports industry – this is all happening at a time when football clubs need to protect their broadcast revenue the most.”In a separate letter to Richard Masters, the Premier League’s chief executive, Obaidly reminded him of the perceived threat to intellectual property posed by the Newcastle deal, the “direct role of Saudi Arabia in the launch, promotion and operation of the beoutQ service” and “the challenge the Premier League itself has faced and will continue to face in taking any action to protect its own intellectual property rights in the country”.Newcastle – whose outgoing owner Mike Ashley is in the United States – and the Premier League have declined to comment on the issue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fad91fd1d7f241ca2c480fa9be021a792930e33/70_106_1705_1024/master/1705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a87632ebe13ab901f10befdbd5ca8a8","title":"which footballers won highest percentage caps world cups the knowledge","story":"Plus: leisurely stadium builds, more sponsors who no longer exist and did the WWE’s owner try to buy Newcastle?“What is the longest time it has taken a club to complete a new stand?” wonders Rob Fielding.“I imagine Oxford United’s Kassam Stadium will beat Port Vale’s 22-year wait for a finished stand. Currently at 19 years with a missing end,” writes James Pollard, while David Calboutin recalls some lengthy inactivity in the north-east. “Newcastle demolished The Leazes End in 1978 as part of a big plan to redevelop the ground. Unfortunately we were relegated and rebuilding was shelved until 1993, leaving a temporary terrace for 15 years, when the new stand was eventually built.”“Which teams have been sponsored by products that don’t exist any more and which team has been sponsored by the most defunct products?” muses Noble Francis.We thought this sounded familiar. But there are earlier instances. Gareth Vaughan goes back to the 1980s: “I recall being told that West Brom were sponsored in 1984-85 by a public health warning to stop smoking. Given smoking is now prohibited in most work and internal public places, I wondered if this fits this description?” Meanwhile, Richard Young adds: “Northern Rock at Newcastle United … Hopefully shortly also Mike Ashley, on several levels.”Chelsea started the Premier League era bearing the logo of a sadly departed company on their chests, writes Stuart Goodwin. “Unbelievably to many who remember their computing heyday with the C64 and Amiga, but Commodore went out of business within 12 months of the completion of Premier League season v1.0,” he notes. “Commodore International’s demise in April 1994 also meant that Chelsea took the pitch for the following month’s FA Cup final wearing the badge of a company that no longer existed. In a similar vein, Crystal Palace went into the Premier League era sponsored by Tulip Computers – the Dutch company went under in 2009.”“In 2011, I heard rumours about the owner of American wrestling company WWE, Vince McMahon, trying to buy Newcastle United,” mailed Morten Hansen in January 2014. “Is this true?”It’s hard to tell where the rumour linking Vince McMahon, CEO and chairman of WWE, with Newcastle came from, but it didn’t take long to spread all over Twitter and start to creep in to the football news consciousness. The Newcastle Chronicle duly put the question to the club, but the official response was to brand the story “nonsense” and refuse to comment further. So the whole thing died almost as quickly as it had sprung in to life. And really, it’s difficult to see how a rumour linking Sensible Mike’s club with the man in charge of this sort of pantomime can ever have gained any traction.As an adjunct to the question on defunct sponsors, Simon Bradley asks: “Who are the most successful shirt sponsors, in terms of honours won? Of course, this is an inexact science, as determining the comparative value of different trophies is highly debatable. But off the top of my head: Sharp must be up there, having sponsored Manchester United during their 90s glory days Carling cleaned up pretty much every trophy going in Scotland by sponsoring both Old Firm teams between 2003 and 2010 and Emirates Airline have four Champions Leagues with Real Madrid, as well as surely a clutch of other honours from various deals across Europe.”“Which professional club has the longest-standing record transfer purchase fee?” wonders Dan Weaver. “My guess is my club Wrexham with Joey Jones, when we were buying players from the European Cup holders, for £220,000 back in 1978.”“Who were the last father and son combination to play in the same team in the Football League?” mails George Read.“Wolves’ Europa League shirt is inspired by the traditional Mexican national team jersey, associated with our record signing Raúl Jiménez,” writes Miles Johnson. “Are there any other instances where a club has released a kit to honour a national team or nation itself? Didn’t Crystal Palace once have a Brazil national team-inspired away kit or something?”“What is the record number of consecutive successful penalties in shootouts in the same type of competition?” asks Richard Askham. “Huddersfield obviously hold the record in Football League play-offs, with 12 (and also the next best with 11). I suspect that Germany in World Cups and Euros will have an unbeatable record and I remember Ivory Coast scoring 12 or more in an Africa Cup of Nations shoot-out.”“Who is the shortest goalkeeper to play in either the old First Division or the Premier League?

The two women then did it together, breathing slowly and intentionally in sync.Breathwork is one of the tools that Douthit, 56, often reaches for when soothing clients. But this time, instead of sitting in the same room inhaling the same air, the women breathed together on Zoom.“It’s devastating, right? I mean, you built this relationship, you fall in love with these people, you get excited about working with them, and then suddenly, you can’t,” she told me.As Covid-19 changes the way women experience pregnancy, doulas like Douthit are caught between a calling to guide their clients through childbirth and the limitations caused by the pandemic. Many hospitals across the country now limit visitors to just the mother-to-be and her partner in the delivery room, meaning doulas, who are recognized by hospitals only as visitors, are forced to support births virtually or not at all. Some are organizing and pushing back on hospital policies that exclude them from delivery rooms, but therein lies an ethical question: at what point does advocating for recognition and respect outweigh the risks of exposing others to the virus as non-medical visitors in a hospital? It’s a debate saddled with historical tension between doulas and the western obstetrical healthcare system.For now, doulas are hastily translating their intimate and hands-on work on to impersonal virtual platforms, and preparing their clients for giving birth without them physically present. “We’re trying to scramble to give support in a different way, and learn a new skill set really quickly,” says Raychel Franzen, a New York-based doula. “I think one of the things that a doula brings to their clients is a calm energy. We can still do that with facial expressions on a video call, but the energy exchange is just a little bit different.”Gwynne Knap, an Atlanta-based doula, is also a faculty member of Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (Cappa), one of a few organizations nationwide that certifies doulas. Recently, Knap’s work has revolved around teaching fellow doulas how to shift their offerings to reflect the circumstances – Cappa has developed resources and suggestions for doulas to support their clients virtually, such as having the woman’s partner wear an earbud, the doula coaching through contractions over the phone. But some techniques used by birth workers to calm and comfort women during labor, like hand-holding and eye contact, are impossible to translate. “A labor doula helps the mom a lot with comfort and suggested positions, but she also calms the partner so they can be more emotionally present,” says Knap. “When the doula’s not there, it’s very hard to do that.”While some doulas have shifted to virtual support, others are pushing back against the new hospital policies and argue that hospitals shouldn’t lump doulas in as regular “visitors”, but rather as critical to ensure the mother’s health. These doulas, along with birth advocacy groups, are organizing virtual town halls to strategize a unified pushback, circulating petitions against inidual hospital policies, and distributing scripts for doulas to use when speaking to hospital administrators about the potentially harmful implications of restricting doulas from labor units. In some cases, that advocacy has resulted in hospitals adjusting their visitor policy to allow doulas, in addition to a partner or support person, on the labor floor.“It’s not a bonus or a luxury for someone to have care that is safe and respectful,” says Cristen Pascucci, founder of Birth Monopoly, an online advocacy organization that focuses on birthing rights. They argue that for some patients, doulas are an essential part of ensuring a healthy, safe birth – especially for marginalized populations like women of color, particularly black women, who bear the brunt of the maternal mortality crisis in America. There is evidence that continuous, one-on-one birthing support, particularly from a doula, reduces the risk of dissatisfying or traumatic birth experiences, unplanned C-sections and low Apgar scores – the method physicians use to assess a newborn’s health immediately after birth.“There are people who, I feel comfortable saying, have to have a doula to have a safe birth,” Pascucci says. For women of color and low-income women, who statistically face bias from healthcare workers, and who suffer higher maternal mortality rates and worse birth outcomes as a result, a doula can act as a crucial mediator. Many doulas work closely with their clients to inform them about their rights as patients, and talk through the questions they can ask their providers about interventions before they happen.She adds: “Doulas have been quietly filling in the gaps of the maternity care system for years and years. Now we have a crisis and the same system that doulas have been making up for, the first chance it got, was like, we still don’t know what you do and we still don’t appreciate you. So all of those gaps that doulas were filling are back.”For other nurses working on the frontlines, it’s a tough call. One labor and delivery nurse in New Orleans, who asked to remain anonymous out of concern for her job, understands that she can never replace the role of a doula in the delivery room. “Doulas provide an excellent service in that one-on-one care,” she says. “As a nurse, I can’t be in there to get you through every contraction.”Her hospital’s labor and delivery unit, which previously had minimal restrictions on non-patient visitors, now only allows one support person a patient, and only when they’re actively in labor. (A patient kept overnight for blood pressure monitoring, for example, cannot have any visitors.) She has had to field frantic phone calls from women asking for their doula to be allowed in, only to tell them no. “I think it’s thrown a lot of women – this is their plan, and everything has been thrown off,” she says. “I think about how scary that must be.”On the other hand, she works in a city besieged by the virus. Every unit of her hospital, which is full, has been overrun with Covid-19 patients (including some in labor and delivery), and the hospital has run out of personal protective equipment for its staff.“We’re struggling,” she says. “We’re told to reuse our masks. We’re told to wipe down our plastic gowns between uses. It’s a very somber walk into the hospital each day. Because of what I’ve seen, I think the fewer people in the hospital, the better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7adcc055d97a72838257412d633d6fda2ec3381c/0_895_5546_3326/master/5546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e5ee56ffb3f78f6fac779a508e3fcdf","title":"self isolation is bringing out the worst in some how do we avoid conflict","story":"Things are tough right now, writes advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith, but we must try to keep contempt at bayThese days of self-isolation are bringing out the worst in some people. With very little warning that can go off like a bomb. I fear that as these weeks of lockdown drag on, this sort of surprise misbehaving and mistreatment of others will only get worse. Not only by those loved ones who we are in quarantine with, but neighbours, colleagues and other acquaintances that we happen to cross paths with through email, Zoom, etc. How do we avoid conflict with people at this time?The first thing dozens of spouses did when they got out of isolation in Wuhan was file for orce. Children moved out of parental homes and swore not to speak to family again. I think a lot of us are afraid that isolation might cause this kind of collapse in our closest relationships. Not through fights or conscious decisions, but through the “everything and nothing” cataclysms that wait for us when we just handle each day a little badly and let the days add up.You don’t need me to tell you that things are tough right now. The problem is that while “things are tough right now” is usually a reason to go a little easy and ask a little less of each other, this “right now” might be several months long.Usually we can put off emotional things until we feel better – until we’ve slept, eaten and exercised – but this foul mood won’t be so easily lifted. So we need to find a way to do two things at once: honestly feel and acknowledge the ways this pandemic is fraying our mental edges, and find more to say in response than “it’s only for now”.One place to start is with vigilant attention to what we allow as normal. Do not permit small expressions of contempt. Anger, frustration, sadness, blame – yes, but never contempt. Keep contempt out of your home and you’ll have a difference in the kind – not just degree – of your fights and the curdled sprawls that ruin families. Don’t just take it in your stride when people speak to you in ways you don’t like – act surprised. Surprise marks clear edges around what we expect of our relationships, and communicating that “this isn’t normal” is often an effective way of communicating “it shouldn’t be”.Another place to start is something that can sound naff but I promise works: focus on the ways differences can be strengths. We’re not very good at understanding other people’s reactions to crises, and we don’t feel understood when they don’t share ours. But there’s strength in the fact that we react differently. Maybe you can’t stand your mother’s over-stocking of the fridge. Maybe your husband’s insistence on routine seems too stiff-upper-lip. But if we focus on being grateful to her for keeping us fed, and to him for keeping us moving, then maybe they can learn to be grateful for whatever your reaction gives them that they wouldn’t have alone. A pandemic is a good time to stand back-to-back with people who have skills you don’t.And talk. We have to talk. If people can’t ask directly for what they need they’ll either manipulate it out of other people or silently resent that they’re not getting it. Practice honestly asking, and honestly telling: do each other the service of hoping those conversations can be productive.We are all going to find ourselves and the people we love behaving in some profoundly unlikable ways. But the mission isn’t to like each other, it’s to love each other, which is much harder – and much more likely to get us through.

About 64 million subscribers watched Netflix’s Tiger King documentary as much of the world went into lockdown to avoid the pandemic. Other hits included the reality show Love Is Blind, which attracted 30 million subscribers in the last three months, and its original film Spenser Confidential (85 million).The company acknowledged that the huge surge in membership and audience was probably temporary.“In our 20+ year history, we have never seen a future more uncertain or unsettling. The coronavirus has reached every corner of the world and, in the absence of a widespread treatment or vaccine, no one knows how or when this terrible crisis will end,” the company said in a statement.“At Netflix, we’re acutely aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to people confined at home, and which we can operate remotely with minimal disruption in the short to medium term. Like other home entertainment services, we’re seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth.”Mihir Haria Shah, head of broadcast at Total Media, said the long-term impact of the coronavirus on Netflix’s business remained to be seen.“There is no doubt that Netflix has been helped by the viral sensation that is Tiger King and also new seasons of Narcos Mexico, Ozark and Money Heist – which are all Netflix originals favourites. The challenge in continuing to grow and also preventing churn is likely to be how long they can sustain dripping in new series with production studios shut for the foreseeable future,” he said.Netflix, like many other studios and networks, has shut down production on original content since 13 March. The streamer has since set up a $100m fund for workers whose jobs have been directly affected. Recent weeks have seen a number of large acquisitions, including the Paramount action comedy The Lovebirds and Enola Holmes, with Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown as the younger sister of Sherlock Holmes.“While we’re certainly impacted by the global production pause, we expect to continue to be able to provide a terrific variety of new titles throughout 2020 and 2021,” the statement said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad9454a6fabbf5068d83bd662723766e9b2ab502/0_261_7819_4692/master/7819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=933f9736690c02e3585ef38cc46f4c88","title":"tenants told to use lunch and holiday savings to pay full rent","story":"London agent for billionaire landlord turns down residents’ request for coronavirus reliefTenants who asked their billionaire landlord for a rent reduction during the coronavirus pandemic were told to use the money they would have spent on lunches and holidays to pay the full amount due.But the letting agent, Tower Quay properties, told them their request was “unreasonable” and “unrealistic”, adding that any drop in tenants’ income would be minimised by a reduction in spending on holidays, entertainment, travel, clothes and lunches.“Subsequently, when all of this is taken into account, in most cases we believe the impact on disposable income will be minimal, and there is therefore no justification for any reduction in rent, especially considering that whilst tenants are isolating the wear and tear in properties is increasing, which will be at the cost of the landlord,” the agent said.The agent also noted the recent support announced by the government, adding that the building’s commercial landlords did not speak directly to tenants and that all communication was to be with the agent.Tower Quay is the agent for 170 flats in Somerford Groveon behalf of the tenants’ corporate landlords. Most of the tenants who signed the letter have three corporate landlords that are also the freeholders: Simpson House 3, Reverie Estates SR Limited, and Somerford Assets 3. All three companies are majority owned by the billionaire property developer John Christodoulou.While Somerford Assets 3 is the freeholder for some flats at Olympic House on 12 Somerford Grove, the leaseholder for around a dozen of the tenants who signed the letter is Windermere Holdings Overseas SA, incorporated in the British Virgin Island. The owner of this company is not apparent.Christodoulou owns several properties and hotels across the UK and has appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List. There is no suggestion he was personally aware of the tenants’ request when it was initially made, or the agent’s response.While Tower Quay properties refused to negotiate with the tenancy association, the estate agent did respond to inidual requests.One tenant who had lost their job, and wished to remain anonymous, received the same offer after inquiring about a rent reduction. “I don’t know where they think I’m going to find a job in three months. Nobody is hiring. I just can’t believe they’re not willing to budge just an inch to try and help us out.”Kieran Kirkwood, a spokesperson for London Renters Union (LRU), said: “Tower Quay’s suggestion that their tenants could be saving money on lunch and holidays in the midst of a global pandemic beggars belief.

Kirkwood said failure to do so would result in an “unprecedented crisis of poverty, evictions and homelessness”.A Tower Quay spokesperson said tenants were being supported on an inidual level and that it was clear there were residents who could still pay their rent. “It is also not feasible for a single landlord to simply offer all concessions to all tenants whilst there is no support being offered by the government to landlords to assist this.”The spokesperson apologised if tenants thought remarks on money saved on lunches and cancelled holidays were insensitive, but added: “Based on discussions with other tenants we believe, in good faith, that these comments are true.”Tower Quay said each property has separate corporate landlords and none have a landlord who is an inidual. John Christodoulou did not respond to a request for a comment.

Metallica emphasised a paranoid grind, Anthrax a tongue-in-cheek, streetwise hardcore bounciness, and Megadeth a remnant of old-school, hard-rock boogie Slayer, however, distilled and concentrated the essence of pure metal: the crystal meth to Iron Maiden and Judas Priest’s medical Dexedrine. Every blastbeat and guitar widdle is faster, every scream higher, every grunt lower, every mood either assault or preparation for assault, and the subject matter is boiled down to Satan, slaughter and pain. All of metal’s preposterous theatre and grandiosity is here, but at only 28 minutes from the first everyone-hitting-everything stab of Angel of Death to the final trickle of Raining Blood, it’s perfectly nasty, brutish and short.Those two tracks are the classics that never left Slayer sets. Yes, Angel of Death is about Nazi surgeon Josef Mengele no, Slayer are not Nazis, any more than they are Wahabbists for writing Jihad from the point of view of a 911 hijacker in 2006. In fact, their politics seem to lean to the oafish side of libertarianism. Like the rest of the album, Angel of Death is a schlock slasher movie, to the bone. Raining Blood, meanwhile, is utterly thrilling: even the squeamish or metal-averse can get caught up by the sharp-toothed earworm riffs. The twin-lead intro emerging from thunder and rain is probably the ultimate metal moment for main songwriters and guitarists, Kerry King and the late Jeff Hanemann.But there’s not a weak link on the album. Necrophobic is under two minutes and rivals the UK grindcore acts emerging at the time for speed. Altar of Sacrifice is three minutes of perfect momentum, not a second to take a breath, just a constant rockfall of noise, perfectly controlled then grinding to a halt in the final seconds. It also features singer Tom Araya at his shoutiest, part of an undercurrent of hardcore and anarcho-crust-punk rage that always simmers beneath the metallic surfaces in Slayer. Epidemic is the closest to classic Brit metal, but it’s done with such confidence that they’re owning the sound rather than paying homage to Maiden. And on it goes. Rick Rubin’s production and the band’s incredible ear for structure means that, aside from all the theatre, lyrical dumb-assery and athletic virtuosity, it can – even now – be appreciated on an immediate, unconscious level as a pure sonic rush.Seasons in the Abyss (1990)Slayer were not the heaviest, the fastest nor the most revolting extreme metal band. They were quickly outflanked in the gruesomeness race by Death, Carcass and Cannibal Corpse, and in speed terms by Napalm Death, Electro Hippies and Extreme Noise Terror. But nobody else hit that sweet spot between metal histrionics and pure grunting bestial racket as precisely as Slayer. While they tried to ersify and even mellow on South of Heaven, Seasons in the Abyss is the sound of them realising that they’re at their swaggering best going all-out. There is still some subdued grind here, but it’s the proper rippers, such as War Ensemble and Hollowed Point, that make it. It’s also got some of Slayer’s most fun sonics: the way lead guitar notes leap out of the surge of churning riff like spurts of lava from a boiling hellscape demonstrates their key skill of making extreme musicianship come off as audacity rather than onanism.Appropriately for a band who take metal to the nth degree, Slayer’s career has been turbulent – from Lombardo’s multiple splits from the band to Hanneman’s troubles with arthritis, necrotising fasciitis, and the alcoholism that eventually killed him. But, despite all this, their output has been remarkably consistent. Their only real fallow patch was the second half of the 90s, when they released only the decent enough punk covers album, Undisputed Attitude, and the sadly nu-metal-influenced Diabolus in Musica. But with God Hates Us All they returned to form spectacularly. Apart from religious psychosis replacing the slasher imagery, it’s vintage Slayer. Lombardo’s stand-in, Paul Bostaph, is especially keen to prove his worth. The sheer inhuman barrage of blastbeats on Disciple is one of the most adrenalising sounds in their catalogue, and even a slow track such as Seven Faces takes a terrifying pummelling. From here on, they kept delivering, with 2009’s World Painted Blood – reconstituting the original lineup – an especially tight collection. Even their 2015 swansong, Repentless, though derided by metal critics as unadventurous at the time, still stands up as a top-drawer thrash record.If ever there was a record that delivered the stink and bruises of the moshpit, this is it. Though the debut album Show No Mercy, and Hell Awaits which followed in 1985 both show Slayer pushing at the boundaries of what metal could achieve, it’s clear that their live shows was where they truly cut loose: this is the lightning that they would finally successfully bottle on Reign in Blood. The total meshing of guitar maelstrom, Lombardo’s machine-like kickdrum rolls, and Araya’s Rob Halford scream at the climax of Antichrist must have been staggering to experience in the flesh, and it’s no wonder the roar of the crowd, audible throughout, is so deranged.South of Heaven (1988)While many bands insist that their latest album is their best, King has admitted, with an impressive lack of ego, that he was fine with the idea they might never top Reign in Blood. Nonetheless, it took them a while to get past its brilliance. With all eyes on them – thanks not only to Reign’s success but to the meteoric rise of Rick Rubin and Def Jam – they chose not to replicate the previous glory but to slow things down. Oddly, it kind of sounds like Slayer making a Metallica album. It rarely takes flight like their best, but it is a fantastic record. It is more trad metal than Reign, but it still has the swaggering confidence to the playing – and it might even be a good point of introduction for the timid.In Tribute: The Complete, Untold Story of Slayer’s Jeff Hanneman, by Jeff Kitts (2015)This memorial piece, published in Guitar World a year after Hanneman’s death, is a perfect intro to Slayer’s dysfunctional world, and to Hanneman’s sweetly domesticated off stage life as well as his tragic decline. Contains the perfectly metal phrase: “Jeff pretty much only went to war museums, as you can imagine.”Slayer 66 23: The Jeff \u0026amp Dave Years. A Metal Band Biography: Post-Repentless Remastered Edition, by DX Ferris (2018)Three hundred and fifty pages of precisely the sort of exhaustive detail that metal fans demand about “37 years in the Abyss”, this is the most complete and up to date Slayer text. Even includes Hanneman’s stick-figure concept drawings for the Live Undead picture disc.The Bloody Reign of Slayer, by Joel McIver (2010)Joel McIver is the rock biographer of our times, with books on Black Sabbath, Metallica and Queens of the Stone Age (and Ice Cube!) under his belt, all beloved because he writes for fans as an unabashed fan.

Now, they tell us how things have changed, as the country endures another three weeks of lockdown.We’re just as busy as we ever have been. Friendship issues and family disagreements are all escalated because of the lockdown. Friendship issues are more difficult to resolve because they can’t talk face to face which causes misunderstandings. Family members are now spending more time together.Normally as a supervisor you have other things going on, managing volunteers, training people, interviewing for new volunteers, things like that. Now I’m just working shifts, often back to back. This is like going back to basics, just making sure the core service is still running. Our volunteers are brilliant, normally they give up four hours a week for a shift, but some have been coming in three times a week or after work. We still have to come into the office because the calls system can’t be operated from home.But we have to work out ways of doing other things, otherwise there won’t be a service. Volunteers are constantly changing, it’s like a leaky bucket: one leaves as the other comes. So if we don’t train and recruit, we won’t have any volunteers.Before we just had a low door between us and the passengers, but now there are pieces of floppy plastic which hang down from the ceiling like a shower curtain, as a barrier between us. One passenger said I looked like a piece of cake covered in cling film. The problem with the curtains is that they’re all the same size, and buses aren’t, so some fit and others flop in the breeze while you’re driving because the ceiling is too high. This means on some buses, you can’t keep the window open, which isn’t very safe as I try to keep maximum air flow so I’m not breathing in what passengers are breathing out.I can see that elderly people and people who live in small houses on the local council estates have been worse hit by the lockdown. Getting online and home delivery is fantasy for elderly people – they don’t have computersand don’t know how to use them, so they have to take the bus to get food. People from worse-off backgrounds don’t have big fridges to stockpile, so they have to go to the shops regularly too.The roads have got busier again since Boris Johnson came out of hospital. When he went into intensive care, there was a drop in the number of people around, I think they took it more seriously. But now there are a huge number of people around, and its slowly started to build up.Our residents are doing great, we had a big outdoor concert yesterday. We had a measuring tape out making sure all the seats were two metres apart, and entertainers. We broadcast it live on Facebook for families to watch.I moved into the care home last week. It reduces the risk of me bringing in coronavirus. Someone near our house died from it, so it seems like a sensible thing to do. Last week I changed all of the staff shifts from seven hours to 12 hours, to restrict the number of times staff are in and out of the building. I know another care home who’ve had 15 staff members off sick and two deaths, but luckily we haven’t had any staff off or any infection. I think that’s to do with the cleaning procedures we had originally. For example, before we opened we spent £2,500 on a mopping system, which means we have good quality mops, and different ones for different sections, so they never cross over.We also tried to get ahead, and closed the home very early. The staff always go above and beyond, too.We’re only allowed 40 people in the store, but when you’ve got another five staff members on the till and six on the shop floor, that’s a lot of people at any one time.Abuse to staff seems to have increased much more since coronavirus, but perhaps I just notice it more as there are fewer people on the shop floor. Alcohol has been flying off the shelves. Because people aren’t going out, they have more money to spend, and there’s no pubs so everyone’s drinking at home– and, from what I can see, drinking quite a lot.The car park is full again, so the wildlife is gone. There’s not a lot of panic about it any more. I’d rather people do a trolley dash, but as there’s nothing else to do, and supermarkets are one of the only places still open, it’s leisure time.Some people are still taking it seriously. A lady came in spraying Dettol all over her bag, her purchases, and because I was behind the till, all over me. It’s also strange being surrounded by people in masks, it’s like every dystopian film coming to life.It’s still really busy. We’re having lots of complaints from vulnerable and elderly people who are meant to be given a slot to get food, but they’re all saying they can’t get a delivery in for three weeks. It’s causing a lot of problems, and making them go out to do shopping if they haven’t got anyone to do it for them.People appreciate that food is getting to them, but there’s still a massive shortage of products so we have to make lots of replacements. In store, the problem is that online shopping takes a lot of stuff off the shelves in the morning, so when the store opens it’s already gone and you’re going into an empty store. At our depot, the frames where we sort and prepare mail for delivery have been moved apart to enable better social distancing. This is a very welcome change. Beforehand the tight conditions made any interaction a risk and this was causing increased stress among our staff, causing some to go absent. There have also been two confirmed cases of the virus at work, but no flag has been raised over who or what they were in contact with before it was confirmed.Despite this, it feels great to be out on delivery and have people thank you and cheer you on. Considering the unprecedented nature of this crisis, adapting to it has been relatively straightforward. And you can forget how strange it is. Having the public acknowledge the hard efforts of our service is the juice that keeps me going.In and amongst the collective mood of uncertainty, there are jewels to be witnessed as a postman : neighbours sharing a slice of cake for breakfast in their respective front gardens, and joining in with children playing hopscotch that they’ve colourfully drawn in chalk on the streets.One hopes when this period has passed, we might retain some of these tender moments of connection seen between people and their communities.It’s a lot busier now and I’m exhausted. We’re doing five or six, mostly Covid, burials a day and digging continuously in between. There are no breaks. The PPE is running out now – we still have masks but the overalls are in shorter supply. Without new stuff we will run out this week.The niceties of the job have gone and we have to ask people attending burials to step back and stay away from us. It’s hard – it should be about dignity and providing a caring space but it’s life or death potentially. I need to protect myself and my colleagues.People say I’m lucky to still be going out to work and I can understand the creeping madness of staying in but they don’t know what work is like for me. If people aren’t social distancing, I get angry – I’m not happy with the way I’m behaving.I don’t know what day of the week it is any more – I go to work and come home and it’s like a tunnel. I spend most of my days staring into a small dark hole. It’s like a bad version of Groundhog Day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b83b721e981dcfd639bfaddc1c193c0a2055ece/0_433_7497_4499/master/7497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b91df1feac94d0c95dcf03177b4854d","title":"how home working leaves deaf people out loop coronavirus","story":"Three-quarters of people with hearing loss fear they will be less productive working from home. What support is needed?Working from home is a challenge for many of us, from learning how to communicate with colleagues via Zoom, to acquainting ourselves with the nuances of telephone conference calls. But imagine what it must be like if you are deaf or have difficulty hearing.Research published on Wednesday by the charity Action on Hearing Loss found that three-quarters of people who live with deafness fear they will be less productive working from home. Rob Geaney, head of campaigns and public affairs at Action on Hearing Loss, says: “Home working is a huge challenge for people living with deafness or hearing loss. They are at greater risk of further isolation due to social-distancing measures. While many people will use phone and video calls to stay in contact with friends and families and work colleagues, people with hearing loss, especially those who lip-read or use British Sign Language, will be excluded from these interactions.”Lip-reading requires an inidual to concentrate intently on both the movement of the lips and the sound they can hear to piece together what is being said, Geaney explains. This is tiring and many people only get most of what is being said – with contextual clues being used to fill the gaps.“It is therefore helpful to consider using text boxes or visual presentations alongside video conferences, particularly if communicating numbers or complex jargon,” he says.“To make the workplace more accessible, face someone when speaking to them, speak one at a time in meetings, and don’t give people a desk facing a wall but allow them to face into the office, so they can communicate,” says Geaney.“The key thing for home working is that managers should feel able to talk to members of staff about their hearing loss and the adjustments that they need,” he adds.But the charity’s focus groups revealed a reluctance among employees to disclose hearing loss at work because of embarrassment, stress or fear that it might affect job prospects. One said: “You want to do a good job at work, you do not want anyone to see hearing loss as a weakness.”“It’s a hidden condition and many staff who have concealed their hearing loss and coped without any support might now need support to find adjustments that work for them,” says Geaney. Similarly, those who had adjustments set up in their place of work might now need new adjustments put in place, such as an amplified telephone or handsets that can be linked to an inidual’s hearing aid. Behaviour changes that hearing colleagues could make include speaking one at a time, muting themselves when not speaking to reduce background noise, having a clear agenda to provide structure and contextual clues to what is being said. For video conferencing it is helpful if the camera is square-on and everyone is well lit from the front. If the source of light is behind the inidual then faces might be in shadow.Action on Hearing Loss research suggests the biggest reason people are without support is that they feel colleagues lack the knowledge to help. Almost half of respondents surveyed said deaf awareness (“information on educating your colleagues or managers”) would help them fulfil their potential, and more than a third said support to manage the anxiety of hearing loss at work would help.City Lit adult education college in central London holds an annual Deaf Day to raise awareness (although this year’s has been postponed due to coronavirus). Founded in 1919, the college began running lip-reading classes for soldiers deafened in the first world war. Courses specifically for deaf people include BSL, English, maths and digital skills. There are 12 deaf tutors and six who are hearing (but teach in BSL) plus a network of BSL interpreters who offer support in meetings or job interviews. It also provides employment advice to its students in partnership with the Royal Association for Deaf people. A bursary helps low-income deaf students pay course fees and travel.English is often a second language for deaf people after sign language. But for Ilyaas Cader, a refugee from Sri Lanka, his first language is Tamil Sign, his second BSL and his third English. “I learned sign language first – that helped me learn the English. I had to learn English grammar, which is different from sign grammar,” he tells me, using a BSL interpreter. Cader, 45, won a City Lit centenary award last year for outstanding achievement. He is a children’s mental health worker in a specialist NHS unit for deaf children, and says his career is largely due to his time at City Lit. Without the specialist classes and support to get a job, he says, “I definitely wouldn’t be working in mental health where I’m using my skills and my challenging experiences – barriers, emotional struggles, lack of access – to be a role model to children of how a deaf person can succeed.”Deaf people are twice as likely to have mental health issues compared with hearing people, with communication barriers exacerbating symptoms like depression. There are also communication barriers for deaf people receiving mental health support. BSL interpreters are third parties in counselling sessions designed to be one-to-one. This can affect treatment because the counselling can be less intimate. Cader believes that “audism” (negative attitudes towards deaf people) is deeply ingrained. More hearing professionals using sign language would help, he says.“If a deaf person needs to go to the doctor, they should be able to have a conversation with the doctor in their first language. And there should be more people like me out there doing the sort of work I’m doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fdefcda50086b87c6631522518e3985b272c445/479_136_2876_1726/master/2876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23bca1834c26251999bc0836031922f0","title":"world rugby administration needs to work many not few","story":"While Agustín Pichot offers something different and perhaps more democratic, old-school diplomacy remains favouriteThere are various schools of thought about leadership. Some people are perfectly clear: they wouldn’t touch responsibility with a disinfected barge pole. Others fancy the power or, all too often, the money.It is uncommonly rare, particularly in sports administration, to find people genuinely keen to do it for altruistic reasons, for the benefit of the many rather than the few, or because they possess far-sighted vision and intelligence. Rugby, more than most, could do with a few more in the lesser-spotted latter category. The game at home and abroad is not awash with confidence in those in charge and it hardly requires a lockdown crystal ball to see that situation becoming worse before it improves.To cap it all World Rugby has now been forced into an embarrassing climbdown after managing, as you do, to include a convicted killer on its official list of executive committee candidates. Tough game, rugby, but even so.It was hardly a secret, particularly around the Pacific islands, that Fiji’s Francis Kean is not the world’s greatest bloke. Nevertheless, it required considerable courage for Dan Leo of Pacific Rugby Players Welfare to write a remarkable open letter to council members that ultimately forced World Rugby’s hand. “It is extraordinary to anyone involved in the game in the Pacific that Kean is even on the ballot,” wrote Leo, who has already done much to champion the cause of players from the Pacific islands and highlight some of the significant issues they face on and off the field.As it happens, he is also a supporter of Agustín Pichot’s campaign to become chairman of World Rugby in place of the incumbent, Bill Beaumont, who is seeking re-election. The ballot is due to take place next week and Pichot has not entirely given up hope of overcoming the odds which, as ever, remain stacked against those operating outside the cosy Six Nations club.As it happens, Pichot and Beaumont are proud, respected rugby men and former national captains. Their manifestos, at first glance, are not poles apart. It is less about personalities, then, and more about priorities and open‑mindedness. World Rugby, a vast oil tanker that traditionally takes years to turn round, is being invited to hand the wheel to a new skipper more attuned to the renewable energy sector.If it feels like a significant moment, that is because it is. Starboard for eight more years of old-school diplomacy – by naming Bernard Laporte as his running mate, Beaumont may feel he is keeping the seat warm for the former France national coach – or port for something different.That the vote will be conducted by private ballot and the result not announced until 12 May says a fair amount about World Rugby’s modus operandi. With the established nations permitted three votes while everyone else has to settle for two or one, this particular group of turkeys are not about to vote for Christmas. Self‑interest, as it has done for decades, shapes virtually everything.Some argue rugby already has enough to deal with and does not need any more apple carts upturned at this precise moment. That is not how they see it in Australia where 11 former Wallaby captains – George Gregan, Nick Farr-Jones, George Smith, Stirling Mortlock, Michael Lynagh, Simon Poidevin, Phil Kearns, Stephen Moore, Jason Little, Rod McCall and Nathan Sharpe – have written to Rugby Australia expressing their concerns about how the game there has been administered in recent years.“There is only one question that needs to be answered at club level, at state level and at national level: ‘Is this decision in the best interests of Australian rugby?’” reads the letter. “Only when we can answer that question openly, honestly and transparently at all levels can we restore Australian rugby to greatness.”Those labouring in office will argue that lobbing bricks from the sidelines is far easier than navigating a way out of the grim vortex of plummeting crowds and revenues, virus-hit fixture lists and thorny governance issues. Assorted national unions and league governing bodies are copping plenty of flak but, in their defence, the range of problems now being faced is more extensive – and potentially more worrying – than at any time.There is a way out, though, for those leaders around the globe brave enough to grasp it. Why not, as the distinguished former Wallabies suggest, focus on doing the right thing, rather than taking the most expedient option? Why not engage more with the public and media and be frank and honest about the game’s issues, rather than endlessly hiding behind corporate speak or ducking potentially awkward questions?Openness might just encourage greater understanding and forgiveness and pierce the current perception, unfair or not, of certain executives making a priority of bottom lines rather than players. Lead, in short, by example. Without trust, pride and respect at its heart, rugby is nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edb26bf06d7eff16bafd885617b100ba67c15885/234_360_5003_3002/master/5003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50228c3c2013beca7063d552f188c475","title":"talking horses zac purton hopes to enjoy joao moreira happy valley absence racing","story":"Australian rider could recover in nip-and-tuck tussle for the Hong Kong jockeys’ title with Brazilian rival suspendedZac Purton and João Moreira are engaged in a nip-and-tuck tussle for the jockeys’ title in the current Hong Kong season but the Brazilian opened up a three-win lead with a treble at Sha Tin on Sunday and Australia’s Purton will be eager to take advantage of his great rival’s absence due to suspension when the action shifts to Happy Valley on Wednesday.Purton has a ride in eight of the nine races on the card, which – unlike Sha Tin three days ago – will be staged in the evening local time and thus gets under way at 11.45 BST, a much better time of day from a European punter’s point of view.Seven of Purton’s mounts, meanwhile, look likely to set off as either the first or second favourite, though several have been drawn a little wider than ideal on a track where a low number is generally a big help.According to the Hong Kong Jockey Club’s website, 69 horses have been drawn in stall 10 over six furlongs at Happy Valley since the start of the 2017-18 season and another 21 have been in the same stall over five furlongs. Not one of those 90 horses has come home in front. The draw has slightly less impact at longer trips, but stalls one and two still account for 17 of 57 winners in the same period over the eight-and-a-half furlongs, the trip for the races at 1.15 and 2.15. 11.45 Stall eight for Purton and possible favourite Kwai Chung Elite, which is not ideal over six furlongs here as stall one has produced twice as many winners – 18, in fact – over the last two-and-a-half seasons as any other (and stall two is next, with nine). Around 6-1 looks fair for Aurora Steed, who should be well positioned from three by Chad Schofield.12.15 Six furlongs again and Blade Racer, a 16-1 shot in early betting, could make the most of stall one. This will be his first race over this trip at Happy Valley after four attempts over five, but he sprang a surprise over six at Sha Tin in September last year and his draw gives him every chance.12.45 London Hall and Above were both winners last time out and attempt to defy hikes in the weights. London Hall is up 7lb for a three-quarter length win and though Above is up 12lb, he was a very smooth six-length winner at Sha Tin and has could be good enough to take this step up in class.1.15 Invaluable is one of the most lightly-raced runners in the field and showed his best form to date when fourth over course and distance last time out. A price of around 5-1 look reasonable.1.45 Winning Ways will be a popular choice from stall four with Purton holding the reins. He was a CD winner three outings ago and competitive off today’s mark next time up, while he got in all sorts of bother when only seventh last time.2.15 Another big chance for Purton on last-time winner Tangmere, but Blooming Spirit has an equally good chance on paper and looks likely to be a bigger price.2.45 Purton on a possible favourite once again with Lucky Quality drawn in stall one, but he does not have as much early pace as several of his opponents and Happy Good Guys, drawn just outside in two, could be better placed to strike.3.15 Dancing Fighter was coming back from a 112-day break when only eighth – and a beaten favourite – over CD last time, but he missed the kick badly from stall nine and has a much better pitch in two this time and Purton can make the most of it.3.50 The second of two Class Three races, worth £80,000 to the winner apiece, at the end of the card. Larson was a ready winner last time out but it up 6lb and could be vulnerable from stall 10. Classic Unicorn has the rail pitch and should make it count."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5312b71d571f2928af743e2a36a6fcdac2e6a47d/0_119_4929_2960/master/4929.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e69c1fd747c471e9f8d62cb84be8ee49","title":"why the nfls lockdown draft may be the oddest and best yet","story":"With the pandemic shutting down most of America, this year’s star prospects will discover their new teams by video linkIt’s almost inconceivable now to think that this week’s NFL draft was supposed to take place amid the glitz of Las Vegas. Parties galore. Drafted players hugging the commissioner with the Bellagio fountains dancing in the background. A cacophony of cheers and boos from a packed crowd.Then came Covid-19. Now, aside from the dates (23-25 April), everything about the three-day spectacle has changed. It will instead take place in a virtual format with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell’s basement serving as the new stage.In a normal year, viewers in the US would have their choice of three different broadcasts, from ESPN, NFL Network and ABC (an option introduced last year and geared toward casual fans).Given the new, post-lockdown landscape, NFL Network and ESPN decided to merge their resources into one unified broadcast from ESPN HQ in Bristol, Connecticut. A barren studio will be graced solely by Trey Wingo. Suzy Kolber will conduct player interviews (by video) while an array of reporters and analysts will participate from home. Talent from the two networks will be mixed and matched. This means that ESPN’s Mel Kiper and NFL Network’s Daniel Jeremiah, typically competitors in the draft space, will likely appear on air together. “The idea is to use the people and their expertise regardless of which network we work for,” says NFL Network executive Mark Quenzel. “This is the best thing for NFL fans.”Since media is deemed an essential business, there will be producers running both the ESPN and ABC telecasts from a control room in Bristol. But the number will be half of a typical crew and, as mandated by the state of Connecticut, they must maintain social distance and wear face coverings. Communicating in real time through a mask to an army of feeds projected to be somewhere between 170 and 180 will pose quite the challenge.The 58 prospects invited to attend the virtual draft will double as cameramen. The NFL is counting on each player to set up two cameras. One for up-close reaction shots, the other a wide shot of the room. NFL agent Nicole Lynn, who represents tackle Jedrick Wills and quarterback Jalen Hurts, says her clients were told the wide-shot camera will capture them simulating the traditional “walk to the stage”. At that point they will have some type of congratulatory virtual interaction with Goodell.Well, everything. During the first of several trial runs, there were reportedly multiple issues from general managers not muting themselves during a conference call to problems with bandwidth.The league’s tech wizards will be working overtime to minimize the issues but technology and uncharted waters don’t often mix well.Then there are the prospects themselves. A player could mistakenly curse on camera – an understandable reaction if you’ve just been drafted by the New York Jets. He could also, God forbid, drink a brand of soda that isn’t an official NFL sponsor. He could break lockdown restrictions by sneaking some buddies in to celebrate. Most likely, we’ll see a litany of minor technical bumps. Last Friday’s WNBA virtual draft featured everything from glitchy screens to newly drafted Chennedy Carter putting her commissioner interview on speaker phone, causing a severe echo.“Clearly we’re there to draft players but more clearly we’re setting the tone that we understand there’s something much larger going on in the world,” says Quenzel of NFL Network. To that end, the NFL is turning its three-day event into a Draft-a-Thon where viewers can donate to help with Covid-19 relief efforts. The charity drive will feature a collection of celebrities and athletes such as Deion Sanders and Kevin Hart. Quenzel says the broadcast will place an equal emphasis on soliciting donations and saying a “proper thank you” to first responders, grocery store workers and other professionals risking their lives to keep society running.Back in March, multiple general managers, including the Saints’ Mickey Loomis, pushed to have the draft postponed. But that was never a serious consideration for the 32 NFL team owners, who voted unanimously to proceed as scheduled.“It’s important to have normalcy,” Goodell told NFL Network’s Rich Eisen last week. “We’re doing this in a way that demonstrates that you can continue to do what you need to do in this country and do it safely at home.”The league’s show-must-go-on mentality extends to the regular season. Goodell has given no indication the new season will be delayed, despite red flags such as California governor Gavin Newsom’s assertion last week that gatherings “in the hundreds” are “not on the cards” any time soon.If the regular season were to begin in September as usual, delaying the draft would impede a rookie’s ability to acclimate to his team’s playbook, engage in team offseason programs, and get a contract signed.Absolutely. Between an oversaturated NFL calendar, a commissioner who’s not exactly a dynamo, and a rulebook thicker than a Dostoevsky novel, the NFL can often feel a tad soulless and manufactured.Of course there will be elements of too much polish in this draft as it’s an official NFL event. But the increased probability of error during the broadcast, may add a refreshing layer of vulnerability and imperfection that we can all relate to these days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b169a0b3b992468ebfde8e7bf1ef2f62819f3ab1/563_241_2327_1396/master/2327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e9f23e4975db1b25a897a80ef27be64","title":"incontinence how women are regaining bladder control","story":"Conversation around the side-effects of menopause is changing thanks to celebrities speaking out – so why do we still avoid talking about bladder weakness?Night sweats, mood swings – language around the menopause is all rather negative and even, some might say, derogatory. It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

What they saw was a great ape that had lived in splendid isolation for 700,000 years. With its kindly black face, orange fur and vast proto-artisanal beard, it looked like the familiar Sumatran or Borneo orangutans, but was neither. In 2017, the Tapanuli orangutan was recognised as a new species. It is smaller, and has paler, thicker fur than its lowland cousins and lives in reproductive isolation on that remote plateau in the north Sumatran jungle 1,000m above sea level.The news about this addition to world species lists prompted producer Nikki Waldron to scramble to the Sumatran jungle, to film the Tapanuli orangutan for the first time. After a few weeks, she and her crew found a mother and daughter in their natural habitat. “When we first arrived, the cameraman sighed. The light levels were really low because of the density of the leaves, and the orangutans live 40m up in the trees.”“We’ve made series about sharks, which are difficult to film, and big cats which are more difficult, and now primates that are arguably the most difficult of all,” says Mike Gunton, executive producer of the new three-part BBC One nature documentary Primates. “They move quickly. It’s hard for camera crews to keep up with them. What’s more, they tend to live in very inaccessible areas like steamy jungles at the top of tall trees.” Yet Waldron and her camera crew captured some poignant shots of a mother teaching her baby daughter how to forage in the trees. The Tapanuli orangutan needs a more varied diet of plants than other orangutans, and baby needs to learn these life lessons fast: after five years, she will leave her mother and forage independently.But the tender images are bittersweet since the world in which the baby will grow to maturity is a threatening one: logging, gold mining and a huge hydropower scheme now menace its habitat. As a result, the Tapanuli orangutan is not only the newest but also the most endangered of ape species: there are only 800 left. “Within a generation they could be gone,” says series presenter Chris Packham.More than half of primate species are under threat of extinction. “The future of them all is in the hands of one primate: us,” says Packham. We are the cause of – as much as the solution to – primates’ problems. One sequence in Primates makes this point eloquently. In Malaysia’s Penang province, a busy road cuts through the habitat of a colony of dusky langurs. Undaunted, the langurs have taken to swinging across the power cables stretched high over the roads, risking electrocution.Wildlife researcher Jo Leen Yap, along with some other volunteers, has built a monkey bridge from recycled rubber. Since they filmed this sequence, though, Malaysia has gone into lockdown, traffic is minimal, and roads are safe for langurs to cross. Primates the world over are being given a preview of what would happen if humans became extinct.Nature returns as humans, albeit briefly, step aside.The prospect of human extinction would be dismal for arguably the most delightful primates in the series, the rhesus macaques of Kathmandu. In Nepal, they are worshipped as gods and take up positions in city streets where the faithful gift them offerings of food. Better yet, there is a fountain reserved for their use and it is here that camera crews captured some of the loveliest footage. Rhesus macaques, it turns out, love athletically spinning into the pool and cannonballing each other wildly. “It’s not impossible of course that they are performing for the cameras,” says Gunton. In a sequence shot in Tanzania, primatologist Russell Mittermeier completes a lifelong personal quest by spotting the last of 79 genera of primates that exist on our planet. The kipunji monkey wasn’t described by science until 2015 and is one of the most endangered primates in the world.We live in such a crazily unnatural world that, as we learned from the Netflix documentary Tiger King recently, many more tigers are in American captivity than live wild on the entire planet. It is a world, too, in which there is an online trade in gibbons for pets – which are often abandoned once they grow up and their propensity to domestic destruction eclipses their charm.In Primates, we see conservation groups habituating such domesticated primates to the wild. Mittermeier argues that the best way to save such animals is to promote ecotourism, often to conservation initiatives where primates can be watched unobtrusively by humans. Primate watching, he argues, provides income for local communities and an incentive to protect primates and their habitat.But such initiatives are in peril now so few people are travelling. What’s more, great ape sanctuaries are in lockdown. “We don’t know for certain yet whether primates can pass on Covid-19,” says series producer Gavin Boyland. But given the Ebola virus is thought to have killed thousands of chimpanzees and gorillas in Africa, lockdown is a sensible precaution. “It also means we could not have shot the series now. And, going forward, it is not clear how we will be able to work.” At the same time, lockdown means Primates has an unprecedentedly captive audience. “Lots of people are yearning to experience nature now,” says Boyland. “We certainly didn’t have any idea that Primates would be shown at a time of lockdown but we hope it will not just inform people but give them a virtual experience.”There’s a lot to bewitch in this consistently beautifully photographed series. Made over three years, it’s a virtual nature walk in which we meet 25 of the 500 species of primates that exist in the world today, including Madagascar’s beguiling and nocturnal blue-eyed black lemur, which is about 150 times smaller than the biggest creatures in the series, Congo’s mighty mountain gorillas.Primates also gives us mere humans valuable life tips. What should males do when females are exhausted by pregnancy and giving birth? We could emulate the male golden-headed lion tamarins that Waldron filmed in Brazil. “We never expected to find the story of a male who does childcare, but that quickly became the story we told. He becomes , the navigator and a taxi for his daughter. He can’t really be otherwise because her cry is so loud. She’s the most demanding offspring, but he just gets on with his job.” How should we communicate with our offspring when they aren’t listening? We could develop a series of gestures such as those developed by Ugandan chimpanzees. When it’s time to go home, a mother chimp will show its offspring the base of its foot, the little chimp will climb on her back and they will head off. University of St Andrews primatologist Cat Hobaiter has found, from long hours studying footage on her laptop, that chimpanzees in Budongo Forest in Uganda have a repertoire of 80 such gestures. Most topically, the series teaches us the value of collective endeavour, something we may have neglected in our inidualistic society, but which we can rediscover by watching dusky leaf monkeys gang up on a menacing python and shake it from a tree. “Primates are the most social animals,” says Packham. Collaboration and neighbourliness are key not just to survival but to quality of life.All of these wonders have been made possible by new kit. Back in 1990, on David Attenborough’s The Trials of Life for instance, a medical endoscope was used to film inside a bivouac of army ants in Panama. In Primates, a 360-degree camera gives us a sense of what it is like to be a gibbon, hurling oneself through the treetops. The camera, which is a sphere equipped with 24 inidual lenses, is mounted on a cable that traverses the canopy alongside the gibbons. By digitally stitching together the multiple images it captures, the production team gets closer to a gibbon’s-eye perspective than ever before.“I’ve been working on these documentaries for 30 years and so much has changed,” says Gunton. “Trials of Life was a watershed because it was then that we started following the journeys of inidual animals in a way we couldn’t before. And that led to a richer and more intimate experience for viewers.” But, he argues, the biggest change in nature documentaries is not so much in the sophistication of the technology as the sophistication of the viewers. “We don’t just want images of cute animals. We do still want that – but there’s a growing desire to think about what nature is and our role in protecting it.”One sequence in the series particularly touched me. High in the Atlas mountains of north Africa, a broken-nosed old Barbary macaque sat alone. Back in the day, he was an alpha male commanding of a 40-strong crew. Since then, he has become socially redundant, living in 24-hour social isolation. Then temperatures tumbled and a snow storm whipped down from the heavens. Suddenly, several young macaques crawled along the branch on which the venerable male was settling for the bitter night, and hugged him for warmth. Thanks to this hitherto expendable monkey, the juvenile pile-on might survive the night.How lovely to see a superannuated old dude, deemed expendable by society, showing what he has to offer a community in crisis. Or perhaps that’s just me.• Primates starts on BBC One on 26 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cff045aae8f60309e5ff930f909e161fa061151a/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3ad1ccc878c9bdfcf07286ed93d8808","title":"a new normal what do you want a future shaped by covid 19 to look like","story":"Iman Amrani seeks the views of  readers for this video series on coronavirusThe impact of the coronavirus crisis could ripple through every layer of our social fabric.We want to hear what you are concerned about, hopeful for, or even looking forward to in a changed future, for a  video series where we’ll discuss how life may change.

Riders have disappeared as the coronavirus pandemic has locked down the city, funds are drying up. And for the 50,000-plus people employed by the politan Transportation Authority (MTA), just turning up for work has become a matter of life or death.So far about 2,400 transit workers have tested positive for the coronavirus while 4,000 are quarantined. Sixty-eight workers have died.Many are angry at the way – especially in the early days – that the US’s largest transport system responded to the crisis. “They want to call us heroes now, but how can you call us heroes when you didn’t give your heroes the proper equipment to fight this?” said Tramell Thompson, a New York City train conductor.With workers off sick and trains and buses canceled, platforms are sometimes still crowded and trains packed even though ridership has plummeted. The transit system now faces an $8.5bn funding crisis.Some are angry that the MTA did not move more quickly to protect them. On 4 March, according to documents seen by the , a note from an MTA official to transit staff instructed them not to wear masks because “since a mask is not part of the authorized uniform and not medically recommended at this time they may not be worn by uniformed MTA employees”.On 6 March, another memo advised supervisors to tell transit workers wearing masks that they should not wear them during working hours.Both notes said this order would change if the guidance changed – as it did – but for some MTA workers it was too little too late.Thompson, a train operator for six years, tested positive for coronavirus on 13 April after quarantining from work. He first started experiencing symptoms when his asthma medication stopped working, and wasn’t tested until his symptoms worsened to fever, diarrhea and loss of appetite. “This job got me sick. No one else in my family is sick. I’m not going back to the job for it to kill me,” said Thompson. “I’m not going back to work until I’m able to breathe without any help.”Michael Brantley, 36, another MTA train operator, spent three nights in the hospital earlier this month after testing positive for coronavirus. “I undoubtedly believe I got it from work,” said Brantley. “The MTA did not handle this well.”“They have no problem playing Russian roulette with our lives,” said John Ferretti, a MTA subway operator and Transport Workers Union shop steward.Transit workers also accused the MTA of not rolling out safety protocols quickly enough to protect workers and the public earlier from exposure to the coronavirus. The MTA was following state and federal guidelines. It wasn’t until 15 April that New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, told people to wear masks or face coverings in public whenever social distancing was not possible.But MTA workers argue the transportation authority should have known what was coming. “They didn’t start taking personal protective equipment seriously until March 30. The first transit worker died on March 27. They waited until multiple workers died to start taking it seriously. We were sacrificial lambs,” said Canella Gomez, an MTA subway operator for eight years.Gomez claimed a supervisor told him last month to talk to his union in response to requests to improve social distancing at the Bedford Park subway terminal in the Bronx. He also criticized the MTA for only providing temperature checks to supervisors in the subway ision.“It’s a slap in the face to every member of my department who is not sick, still coming to work to try to make their broken system work,” added Gomez.Seth Rosenberg, a MTA subway operator, also noted he was told by a supervisor to talk to his union over concerns he expressed on 17 March about operating equipment not being sanitized and cleaned every round trip in between different co-workers using it.“They told me it was my responsibility, not the MTA’s responsibility, and if I had safety concerns I should talk to the union,” said Rosenberg. “Our labor has been considered essential. Our health has been considered negotiable and our lives are considered expendable.”Ray Reigadas, a MTA train operator, recently returned to work after being quarantined with coronavirus symptoms. He claimed the personal protective equipment (PPE) now being distributed to workers is rationed and limited.“They are now giving out PPE, but you have to ask the dispatcher for it. You think they would hand it to you when you walk in. They give you one mask, two wipes and say that has to last you the week,” he said.A spokesperson for MTA declined to comment on inidual complaints, but noted the agency had followed guidelines and advice from federal and state agencies throughout the pandemic and that transport officials too were frustrated by the lack of support they had received from the federal government.“We feel incredibly let down by the fact the federal authorities were specifically telling us not to distribute medical and personal protective equipment. I think it’s been frustrating for folks in my position and other positions that this guidance keeps shifting and it’s really hard to nail the federal government down on what the right response to any of this is,” said Feinberg.Last week the MTA announced it would pay $500,000 each to the families of coronavirus victims, even if the MTA can not decisively trace the source of a worker’s infection to their job.“What our frontline workers have done during this pandemic is nothing short of heroic and we believe this agreement is another crucial step in recognizing their sacrifice,” said Pat Foye, MTA chairman and chief executive, in a statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b09e19ae4b0d97b97a5b019f586ad7d4787a1f02/0_354_4886_2932/master/4886.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fe571e4bb06b1dfbc39a9a2d7fd5894","title":"non running of the bulls san fermin festival suspended over covid 19","story":"Tomatina food fight also in jeopardy as physical distancing hits Spain’s tourism industryThe festival of San Fermín, which for centuries has unleashed half-tonne fighting bulls into the narrow streets of Pamplona, has been suspended indefinitely as Spain battles one of the world’s deadliest outbreaks of Covid-19.“As expected as it was, it still leaves us deeply sad,” said Ana Elizalde, the acting mayor of Pamplona. “As of today, it seems unlikely that the festival will be celebrated this year, but let’s wait and see how the events evolve.”Spain has recorded more than 21,000 deaths from coronavirus and more than 200,000 confirmed cases of infection. In the northern region of Navarra, which includes Pamplona, more than 350 people have been killed by the virus.“In this context, there’s no place for fireworks, bullfights or bull runs,” said Elizalde.The fiesta, long a target for animal rights activists, has been called off only a handful of times in the past century, for reasons such as civil war or other political unrest. It typically draws around a million visitors for nine days of alcohol-fuelled partying.“It seems our beloved fiesta is at odds with the coronavirus,” Elizalde said. “We’re supposed to wear masks, keep a social distance – measures that are incompatible with what San Fermín is.”In the small town of Buñol, near Valencia, the mayor and town councillors will meet on Monday to debate what lies ahead for the world’s largest food fight. Held each year in August, the Tomatina usually crams 20,000 people into the town to pelt each other with thousands of ripe tomatoes.In the heart of the Rioja wine region – where the coronavirus outbreak has taken a particularly deadly toll – June usually heralds Haro’s wine battle, in which participants drench each other in 70,000 litres of red wine.The rapidly changing situation in Spain has left little room for concrete estimates on when tourism might return to normal. “Our country will not start tourist activity until it is extraordinarily safe, both for those who live in Spain and who come to visit,” the government spokesperson María Jesús Montero said last week.The government imposed strict lockdown measures in mid-March, and closed land borders to all but Spanish citizens and residents soon after.The labour minister, Yolanda Díaz, recently suggested the tourism, culture and leisure sectors would not restart until after the summer and could expect to face “enormous difficulty”.The tourism minister, Reyes Maroto, hinted that jam-packed festivals, beaches and plazas would not be seen anytime soon. “Until there is a vaccine, nothing will be the way it was before. Gatherings will have to be limited to maintain safe distances,” she told the newspaper El País.“It is very important that we continue to follow health recommendations,” she added. “We have to keep up what we are doing now washing our hands, keeping social distance … even on the beach.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c289b5915476567fe00fb9fcff95cc57818457a2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e50f58d021c4c85a957998fca66bf13","title":"coronavirus latest 22 april at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakAt least 177,445 people have died in the coronavirus pandemic so far, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The UK has more than 125,000 cases and more than 16,500 deaths.Donald Trump has announced a 60-day ban on immigrants seeking to live and work in America permanently, and said he could extend it depending on the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The US president framed the executive order, which he expects to sign on Wednesday, as an effort to protect American workers from foreign competition.David Beasley, chief of the UN’s food relief agency told the  that urgent action must be taken to prevent widespread famines across more than 30 countries in the developing world, pushing at least 265 million people to the brink of starvation. He said the Covid-19 pandemic has “taken us to uncharted territory”. Now, my goodness, this is a perfect storm. We are looking at widespread famines of biblical proportions.”The US state of Missouri sued China’s leadership over coronavirus, seeking damages over what it described as deliberate deception and insufficient action to stop the pandemic. Eric Schmitt, the state’s Republican attorney general, said in a written statement that the Chinese government lied about the dangers of the virus and did not do enough to slow its spread. It is unclear whether the lawsuit will have much, if any, impact.A leading US public health official warned on Tuesday that a new wave of coronavirus hitting the US next winter could be “even more difficult” for America to deal with than the current outbreak because it would coincide with the traditional flu season.The country’s prime minister said the government would unveil plans for the gradual reopening from lockdown before the end of this week. Italy reported 534 new deaths on Tuesday, 80 more than on Monday, bringing the death toll to 24,648.

In the latest twist, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was forced to deny claims, later retracted, by the government’s senior diplomat that it had been a “political decision” to opt out of the scheme.What is the EU joint procurement programme?The British government signed the EU’s joint procurement agreement in 2014 after the H1N1 pandemic had highlighted weaknesses in the access and purchasing power of EU countries to obtain pandemic vaccines and medicines.Under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the government has the right to take part until 31 December 2020. The purpose of the scheme is to allow participants to act together as a big block purchaser, securing the best prices and forcing the way to the front of the queue at a time of shortage.What bulk buys have been made this time?Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the EU has launched four calls for tender for medical equipment and supplies. It invited companies to supply gloves and surgical gowns on 28 February, personal protective equipment (PPE) for eye and respiratory protection on 15 March and medical ventilators and respiratory equipment on the same day. A final call to companies to supply laboratory equipment, including testing kits, was made on 19 March. The total value of PPE being purchased is around €1.5bn (£1.3bn). The EU ceiling for purchases of ventilators is €790m. The first call for tender of PPE on 28 February failed because of a lack of suitable suppliers. It was relaunched on 12 March. Since then all four calls for tender have successfully found companies willing to supply the goods to the scale and quality required. The timeline for delivery varies. Some of the PPE is expected imminently. There is a longer time frame for deliveries of ventilators with the EU warning member states that it could take as long as a year for the all the machines to arrive.Why has the UK not been involved?When it emerged last month that the UK was not involved in the EU’s bulk purchase of ventilators despite being aware of its existence and purpose, a Downing Street spokesman said the UK had not joined as the country was “not in the EU”. That line changed within 24 hours and a communications error was blamed. An email from the European commission inviting the UK to join had been sent to an out-of-date and defunct address. When the  reported last week that there had been multiple opportunities to be involved with the purchase of PPE, as well as ventilators, further details had emerged of the communications error. The UK, it was said, had only received an invitation to sit on the the EU’s joint procurement agreement steering group on the 19 March. By then all four of the procurements had been organised.What has happened in the last 24 hours?The Foreign Office’s permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, flatly contradicted the explanation of the UK’s opt-out during an appearance in front of a House of Commons select committee. “It was a political decision,” McDonald said. “The UK mission in Brussels briefed ministers about what was available, what was on offer, and the decision is known.” The comments raised concerns that Brexit ideology had been put before the practicalities of saving lives.Within an hour, Hancock denied that there had been a “political decision”. Shortly afterwards, McDonald issued a formal correction in a letter to the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat. “Ministers were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken whether or not to participate,” McDonald wrote.Has the UK lost out?Hancock and Helen Whately, the care minister, pointed out on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning that the EU’s scheme has yet to deliver any medical supplies. It has also been suggested by anonymous government officials to various media outlets that the UK is now part of a procurement of therapeutics and products required for vaccines.In reality, no such new procurements have yet been launched. As for the ongoing procurements, eight suppliers have offered PPE products in excess of that being ordered by the participating member states, and deliveries are expected to European healthcare workers shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ba617eab86ca600abea84974ac153f912fb1cff/154_0_2691_1615/master/2691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23329b2bcaa46aba44713276298f8a0f","title":"delayed plane carrying ppe from turkey lands in uk coronavirus","story":"Helen Whately says shipment is being checked, but fails to explain why offers from British suppliers were ignoredA health minister has confirmed the delayed Turkish shipment of personal protective equipment (PPE) has landed in the UK but struggled to explain why so many offers of gowns, masks and other items from British suppliers have been ignored.Helen Whately, the care minister, said at least part of the consignment arrived on Wednesday morning on an RAF flight and was being checked, after an unexplained four-day hold up.It was not clear yet whether the supplies contained the promised 400,000 badly needed gowns, which ministers had promised would arrive on Sunday to fix a shortage.The plane had been dispatched from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where two other planes have been on standby to pick up further supplies from Turkey since late on Monday.In a round of broadcast interviews, Whately failed to explain why offers of PPE sitting in British warehouses were being ignored in many cases, including 16m face masks identified by the .She said 3,000 out of 8,000 offers had received a substantive response but the government was prioritising those with bulk supply.However, she had no answer to why offers of immediate kit sitting in UK stockpiles were not being taken up.Pressed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said the main reason was a greater focus on “those who have an established supply chain”, even though the government was grateful for all offers.Despite pleas from NHS leaders for politicians not to talk about kit that has not yet been delivered, Whately said the government was “expecting millions of face masks coming from China” this week.The government has come in for mounting criticism over its failure to ensure NHS staff treating coronavirus patients have the protective equipment they need.Ministers insisted they were pursuing “every possible option” to secure additional kit but said that, with unprecedented worldwide demand, the situation was “very challenging”.The local government minister Simon Clarke could not give a timescale earlier this week on when the supplies would arrive, saying only it would be in the “next few days”.Separately, the government said 140,000 gowns had arrived from Myanmar – but with the NHS using 150,000 a day, the demand on resources remains intense.With fears that staff in hospitals and care homes are risking their lives, the TUC called for an independent inquiry into the government’s handling of the issue to be mounted before the end of the year.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Hospitals have sought other ways of obtaining PPE, with the Mid Yorkshire hospitals NHS trust buying 6,000 sets of coveralls due to a very low stock of gowns, although it admitted this was “not ideal”.Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, has said trusts are being forced into “hand-to-mouth” workarounds, including washing single-use gowns and restricting stocks to key areas.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said at the No 10 press briefing on Monday that work was continuing to find more PPE.He said: “We’re improving our sourcing internationally and domestically to make sure we can get the PPE we need in what is a very challenging international context.“But people on the frontline can rest assured that we’re doing absolutely everything we can and straining everything we can to get the equipment they need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d873d34276148d308106cd4992c4ad15cf9d9e20/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9657800702151b4a96922eb2e12051ef","title":"new zealand lockdown releases charity spirit as ardern be kind mantra kicks in","story":"Volunteers in Wellington tap micro-grant scheme to ensure vulnerable people are not left left without essentialsWhen Lauryn Miller was forced to stay at home during New Zealand’s stringent Covid-19 lockdown, which has barred everyone but essential workers from leaving their houses, she jumped at the chance “to do something for anyone”.Miller, 34, who usually works as a librarian in New Zealand’s capital, Wellington – and lives in the quiet, beachfront suburb of Lyall Bay – has been helping, along with her friends, to deliver food parcels to people nearby who have been left vulnerable during the four-week national shutdown.“For about three years or so I’ve been going over to the apartments, at first in a library capacity, to make relationships with people who might not know that the library is available,” Miller says, referring to the council flats where she delivers some of the packages. “Now I’ve got a lot of friendships that are there.”She and her friends from the suburb’s tiny Lyall Bay Community church have navigated strident restrictions on moving around the city during the lockdown, public health precautions and item limits on supermarket purchases to put together the food parcels and distribute them over fences and on doorsteps. The food parcels are funded by new micro-grants from the New Zealand government based on the idea that those who know their neighbours will be best placed to assist them. NZ$4.8m (£2.4m) – almost $1 for every New Zealander – has been set aside for the scheme, which groups can apply for in up to $5,000 lump sums to spend on projects that improve local wellbeing.When New Zealand’s stringent stay-home rules began in late March, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, urged people to support each other.“Go home tonight and check on your neighbours, start a phone tree with your street, plan how you’ll stay in touch with one another,” she said. Four weeks later, 14 people have died of Covid-19 in New Zealand, with new infections slowed to a trickle.“We will get through this together, but only if we stick together, so please be strong and be kind,” Ardern added.But uncertainty has grown for the plight of New Zealanders most in need when the lockdown ends. Demand for grocery parcels has risen throughout the country during the pandemic, and the coordinator of one food bank in the North Island town of Masteron told Radio New Zealand this week that it had almost run out of stock.At a flat close to Miller’s home in Lyall Bay, Lizzie, 52, says the charity that she usually visits for food is shuttered because it relies on leftover food from local cafes, which are also closed. She lives alone, and spent the first anniversary of her mother’s death in total isolation.When Miller – who she has known “for years” – knocked on her door recently with a food parcel, she was relieved to see a face she knew. A packet of chocolate biscuits in her food parcel was equally welcome.Lizzie has asthma and is prone to bronchitis, but adds that if she does get sick she will not have to “go out and get groceries and put other people at risk”, because she is receiving the parcels. Advocates for marginalised people fear that others have fallen through the cracks.For Cindy Newport, 34, a Lyall Bay resident and friend of Miller’s, hearing from someone in the neighbourhood who had struggled to connect with New Zealand’s social welfare agency by phone in the lockdown’s early days had spurred her to apply for the government micro-grant. The ministry for social development recorded 75,000 phone calls – an unprecedented number – asking for help over four days near the start of the shutdown. It said in a statement that call volumes were now back to normal.The agency had slashed red tape on the grants in favour of speed – with barely any paperwork required – and the money appeared in the Lyall Bay group’s bank account just days after they had applied for it.“It was the most straightforward thing I’d ever done,” Newport says.A military-style operation began between Newport, her husband and their flat mates to safely acquire goods for the food parcels without spreading infection. As New Zealand’s winter approaches, they will also supply heaters and blankets to those who need them.“What I am anticipating is that we haven’t even seen the impact of job losses yet,” she says. “We might be a nice, affluent suburb but the reality is that a lot of people will have impacts from this so I think the needs are only going to increase.”Lyall Bay is a friendly, relaxed area but although its beachfront cafes are closed and surfing is banned, the old spirit is still evident. A block from Newport’s house, one family has kept a diary in chalk on the footpath during the lockdown. “Day 9: It’s tough, but do what you can to help others,” one slogan reads.At nearby Lyall Bay school, swings and netball courts sit empty usually the grounds are hectic with families in the afternoons or at weekends.“I hated having to lock the gates the other day,” says Melanie Dean, the school’s principal. “It just didn’t feel right.”Of the 13 food parcels the Lyall Bay group had packed in the first 24 hours after receiving their grant, 10 were left with families whose children attended the school.Dean says she asked staff to nominate those who might be in need “for a variety of reasons”, before one teacher who has worked at the school for more than 20 years picked up the parcels from Newport’s home and delivered them anonymously.“People don’t like to receive help like that, even if they need it,” Dean says. “We didn’t even contact the families to let them know. We just dropped it on their doorsteps as a surprise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af7cbbfe2fa79f7fc2a40328b494a67cac2f8d02/0_43_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75beeaec02b883d95e46bf1c29e6f010","title":"ramadan in a time of plague coronavirus the best thing is to stay home stay quiet","story":"For many the inability to pray and eat together will be keenly felt, while others are carrying on regardlessMosques will be deserted, daylong fasts will be broken in isolation and in some places the calls to prayer that rally believers together will end with a different exhortation: worship from where you are.Ordinarily during Ramadan, the holy month that commences this week, Muslim community life swells with special prayers at mosques and crowded iftar dinners that can stretch into the early hours.But that kind of socialising now risks spreading coronavirus, and bans on religious and family gatherings will persist across much of the Islamic world even as businesses and government offices start to reopen.“It’s going to be difficult and depressing,” said Mohammad Faoury, who works for a refugee organisation in Amman, Jordan. “Since I’m single and live alone, Ramadan is the month when I can finally see my family for extended periods of time. It’s a time we strengthen the bond.”The virus has emptied Islam’s holiest sites at the most sacred time of year. The Ka’bah, the gold-embroidered shrine in Mecca’s Grand Mosque, is closed to worshippers along with the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina and Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa mosque.“Our hearts are tortured from pain in the holy month of Ramadan,” said Sheikh Omar al-Kiswami, the imam and director of al-Aqsa, where only guards and mosque employees will be permitted to pray. “It is a very sad moment in the history of Islam.”Jamia Masjid, one of the oldest and grandest mosques in the disputed south Asian territory of Kashmir, usually overflows in the evenings with people gathering for prayer and discussing religion, politics and life. This month it will sit silent for the first time in living memory.“In Ramadan I would pray all five times of the day at Jamia and would also do iftar there, but this time it is a matter of life and death,” said Fatima, 74, from Srinagar. “There is danger outside and the best thing is to stay home, stay quiet.”Indonesia has banned mudik, an annual homecoming in which tens of millions of people travel to see their families for Eid-al-Fitr, the festival that marks the end of the fasting month.Across Israel and Palestine, mosques – as well as churches and synagogues – have been closed. Abdullah Abu Galous, a 38-year-old hardware shop owner from the Palestinian city of Ramallah, said it felt as if Ramadan had been cancelled.“I would never have thought that a tiny virus could stop us from celebrating the month of Ramadan. It has held more than one billion Muslims throughout the world hostage,” he said.Authorities in Turkey have so far resisted calls for a total lockdown, insisting the wheels of the economy must keep turning. But Ramadan will be marked by a new four-day lockdown starting from Thursday night, during which families will not be able to travel to eat and celebrate together without risking fines or arrest.The emergency has raised unprecedented issues for many of the religion’s 1.8 billion adherents as they prepare to abstain from food and water during sunlight hours.Several Arab newspapers have carried expert assurances that fasting has not been shown to reduce resistance to the virus. Al-Azhar, Egypt’s top Sunni mosque, said last week that coronavirus could not be used as an excuse not to participate unless it was scientifically established that drinking water helps to ward off the disease.Lockdowns have curtailed the production schedules of some of the soap operas that are a staple of Ramadan evenings in many homes, leaving TV executives scrambling to fill airtime during their most lucrative advertising season.But the inability to pray and eat together may be most keenly felt. In the UK, the Muslim Council of Britain has encouraged people to hold virtual iftars on social media.More than 1,400 people have signed up for nightly iftar broadcast of the call to prayer, and guest speakers are being organised over Zoom by the UK-based Ramadan Tent Project, with the option for viewers to split off into smaller group discussions. “Just because you’re in quarantine, it doesn’t mean you have to spend Ramadan alone,” said Rohma Ahmed, a spokeswoman for the project.Abu Ibrahim, 32, said he was keeping this year’s difficulties in perspective. In 2011 he observed Ramadan under airstrikes in Dara’a, southern Syria. The following year he spent the first day of the month dodging Syrian army patrols to escape on foot to Jordan.“People say, how are we going to get through this Ramadan when we can’t see each other, when there’s a health risk,” he said. “We used to put food on the table and hear the sound of bombing. We were scared of death, of our families dying. Coronavirus doesn’t worry me. I’m in my house, with my family, we’re safe, we have electricity, phones, food.”Fa’ek Thyabat, the imam of Bab Al-Rayan mosque in Amman, said the Qu’ran did not explicitly guide worshippers on how to observe Ramadan during a plague, leaving worshippers to navigate the uncharted territory with reference to the wider tradition.“Similarly, if we know that Muslims who eat garlic and onion are advised not to go to mosques because the bad breath will hurt mosquegoers, it is easy to conclude that you cannot go to the mosque when there is the risk of spreading contagious disease.”In a faith without formal hierarchies, not all Islamic leaders share Thyabat’s interpretation. Hundreds of worshippers continue to turn out for prayers in Herat, Afghanistan, where a hardline preacher, Mujib Rahman Ansari, recently advised his followers that death from coronavirus was a form of martyrdom.In neighbouring Pakistan, the government has compromised with clerics by lifting a ban on group prayers during Ramadan on condition that no carpet is laid, children and older people stay away and worshippers wear masks and keep six feet apart.Maulvi Haider Zaman, a prayer leader in Islamabad, said coronavirus was “not an issue” and insisted it was important people still came to offer prayers during Ramadan.“People are not afraid to perform their prayers,” he said. “We will be imposing social distancing in the mosque but I don’t think it is needed as coronavirus will not affect people in mosques. It’s the home of Allah.” In Jordan, Thyabat said he was instructing worshippers to focus on the upsides. Ramadan in past years had been an occasion for increasingly lavish iftar feasts and shopping bonanzas, he said. “This Ramadan is an opportunity for people to re-adopt the real spirit of fasting, which is about austerity and helping relatives and needy people.”Additional reporting by Sufian Taha, Jassar Al-Tahat, Shah Meer Baloch, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii and a reporter in Srinagar"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0339f3ac7716020b8d134d2da10562f8883867da/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dc4ef5a4aaace2943b04aadf674e203","title":"revealed private firm running uk ppe stockpile was sold in middle of pandemic","story":"Movianto was also involved in legal disputes with firm that built warehouse to store equipmentThe warehouse appears unremarkable, except for its size. Just off a motorway on an industrial estate in Merseyside sits a 35,000 sq m (377,000 sq ft) purpose-built warehouse with 20 loading docks to enable the storage and rapid distribution of hundreds of millions of face masks, aprons, gowns, gloves and body bags.For security reasons, the  has been asked not to disclose the precise location of the UK’s stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in a pandemic. It is being stored on a site where builders moved the equivalent of more than 90 Olympic–size swimming pools of earth to make way for a vast, climate-controlled warehouse.However, the  can reveal that the management and the distribution of the stockpile has been outsourced to a private company, Movianto, which was sold two weeks ago for $133m (£107m) by its owner, a large US healthcare group.The fact that Movianto was being sold in the midst of a global pandemic, months after being instructed by the UK government to start mobilising the PPE supply, would be remarkable enough. But the sale is only the latest development in a turbulent 18 months for Movianto, which has included legal disputes with a property developer who built the enormous warehouse in Merseyside.The disputes culminated in Movianto securing a high court injunction in March last year, to thwart threats by the developer, Oliver Morley, to “lock the gates” and prevent Movianto employees from accessing the warehoused stock.Morley’s company has since gone into administration and its legal claims against Movianto have been discontinued, but Morley maintains his legal battles with Movianto were not over. He called for an investigation into the firm, alleging there was “a much bigger story that needs to be told” about his former tenant, but declined to provide specific details.For its part, Movianto firmly dismisses all of Morley’s allegations, pointing out that his property firm was defeated last year in court. The company insists the legal disputes and the sale have had no impact on its storage or distribution of PPE in recent months.“Movianto firmly believes that it has and continues to perform to all contractual obligations,” the firm said.But the saga is likely to put a spotlight on the UK government’s decision to outsource the management of the emergency stockpile. In three years, the stockpile appears to have been stored in three different warehouses. Meanwhile, management of the stock has been passed from a German–owned multinational to an American one.In the coming months the custody of the UK’s emergency stockpile of PPE will be passed on to a family-run business based in suburban Paris.A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: “The pandemic influenza stockpile held under this contract has remained safely and securely stored at all times and has supported our Covid-19 response through the distribution of vital personal protective equipment and essential supplies to the NHS and social care sector.”Widespread shortages of PPE have dominated complaints over the government’s handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, including from NHS workers who say their lives are being endangered by the lack of adequate protection. This week an RAF plane was dispatched to Turkey to secure more supplies.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists the government is rising to the challenge, and has repeatedly said the PPE challenge has been “one of distribution rather than one of supply”. In addition to procuring new supplies from China, the DHSC has been drawing on the emergency stockpile, which it has stored since 2006 under its pandemic influenza preparedness programme.That stockpile is made up of around 52,000 pallets of equipment worth an estimated £500m. While it contains antiviral medicines and flu vaccines which are of limited use against Covid-19, the bulk of stocks are said to be PPE and hygiene products. Much of the stock needs to be frequently monitored, updated and stored in temperature–controlled conditions.The government owns the stock, but outsources its management to private firms. Previously, the contract was held by DHL. Movianto, a subsidiary of the US health company Owens \u0026amp Minor, won the £55m deal in the summer of 2018.As part of Movianto’s plans, the company entered into business with Morley to build the vast warehouse in Merseyside. In the meantime, the pandemic stockpile was to be temporarily housed in another warehouse, also owned by Morley, in Knowsley.Monvianto’s plans were approved by the Cabinet Office, documents suggest. The company says its decision to enter into business with Morley was “made by executives no longer associated with Movianto”.A notice for the new NHS contract stipulated that the contractor would be required to maintain “a ready state for deployment in the event of a pandemic event”.In early 2019, Movianto became mired in disputes with Morley’s company, which accused the firm of not paying rent for the warehouse in Knowsley. According to Morley, his tenants became “uncooperative”. “This went on for weeks,” he said. Movianto strongly rejects the allegation, saying it paid rent “in accordance with the terms of the lease”.Another grievance related to the payment of electricity bills to power the generators to ensure the stock, including medicines, was stored at the right temperature. Morley claims he ended up having to pay for electricity to power the generators, which “kept going on the blink” resulting, he alleges, in “temperature spikes”.A Movianto source said Morley’s account was inaccurate. In a statement, Movianto said electricity generators were only needed because of “Morley’s own failure to provide a mains supply in accordance with his contractual obligations”.By his own account, Morley’s financial disputes with Movianto culminated in him threatening the firm. “It got to the point where I said I’m just going to lock the gates and refuse you entry to the site.” When that happened, Movianto rushed to the high court in March 2019 and successfully obtained an injunction to ensure continued access to the warehouse.Movianto said the injunction was required as “a result of Morley’s conduct and repeated threats to interfere with Movianto’s operations”. It said Morley’s allegations over rent and generators were undermined by “various court proceedings” that ruled in Movianto’s favour. In July 2019, under the control of administrators, Morley’s property company Industrial North West LLP discontinued its legal claims against Movianto.Morley insists he will continue to seek legal action against Movianto – and he is used to high-profile disputes. In January, he lost a prominent lawsuit against RBS in which he claimed the bank’s controversial restructuring group placed him under duress by seizing his assets after struggling to repay a £75m loan. A high court judge noted Morley used the “borrowed personal wealth” to spend on “South African mining investments, property, cars, a yacht and a jet”.Morley told the  his lifestyle was the result of hard work and “had nothing to do with being a good landlord”. He insists previous business disputes are irrelevant to his grievances against Movianto, which came to a head in May 2019.As works were completed at the Merseyside warehouse and Movianto prepared to transfer the stockpile from Knowsley, Industrial North West was forced into administration. Documents state the firm “failed to comply” with the conditions of a £61m loan facility.Morley lost control of his warehouses and administrators stepped in. According to the administrator’s report, the legal dispute “caused delays to the construction works” at the new warehouse, which were finally completed in July 2019. Movianto said the legal disputes “have had no impact on Movianto’s work in response to Covid-19”.According to a government source, the transfer of the UK’s emergency PPE supplies to the new warehouse was completed by the end of August 2019, four months before the first cases of Covid-19 emerged in China.The warehouse is now owned by Warrington council, which bought the property for £45m in October. During a change of shifts on Tuesday afternoon, warehouse workers were seen having their car boots searched as they left.In the coming months, their employer will switch from Owens \u0026amp Minor to the French company EHDH Holding Group, under a deal agreed on 6 April. The sale is expected to be completed before the end of June, with demand for supplies in the UK’s pandemic stockpile expected to continue for many months.The distribution of that stockpile’s PPE, it seems, may no longer solely be the responsibility of Movianto. Eleven days ago, the DHSC announced a new “247 military operation” to oversee the supply of PPE to health and care workers. “We’ve had to create a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch,” Hancock said.A government source said the coronavirus outbreak presented different requirements to a flu pandemic – the basis of Movianto’s original contract. Movianto was now “supporting” the government’s PPE plan through its contractual obligations, the source said. Movianto said the terms of its NHS contracts were “confidential”.Jeff Jochims, the chief operating officer of Owens \u0026amp Minor, said: “We look forward to closing the sale of Movianto business to EHDH, but in the meantime will continue our ceaseless work to support the global response to this pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f4501278d0ff80d636bff438171ff1a0b5642e3/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c5a8221375ad48f06884b153a76c7b6","title":"wednesday briefing airlines and travel firms deny refunds","story":"Which? says refusals break law but calls for grace period with guarantees … UK jihadist caught in Spain … and Jameela Jamil on her ‘privileged’ outspokennessGood morning, Warren Murray here – keep calm and carry on reading.All of the UK’s biggest airlines and most big holiday companies are breaking the law by denying refunds within 14 days for travel cancelled during the pandemic, according to Which?

Downing Street has weighed in behind Hancock, who has been forced to deny explosive claims by a top civil servant that ministers made a political decision to opt out of bulk-buying ventilators and protective equipment with the EU. However, a spokesman for the European commission rebutted a suggestion by Hancock that the UK had joined the EU group buy efforts, adding: “They are most welcome to participate in future rounds.” The head of the VentilatorChallengeUK consortium has said it made the right choice in deciding to boost production of existing models by collaborating with big manufacturers such as Airbus, Rolls-Royce and McLaren – rather than trying to get new designs approved. The consortium has supplied 250 ventilators to hospitals, with “hundreds” to follow this week and maximum output slated for early May.In our latest global wrap: the prospect of a prolonged worldwide impact from the pandemic has hardened after business leaders warned of a drawn-out recession and US health chiefs highlighted the prospect of a second wave of cases there in winter.

One key measure is the R0, or basic reproduction number, which indicates how many new cases one infected person generates.For an R0 of three we would expect each new case of a disease to produce three other infections.This is not just a measure of the inherent infectiousness of a disease. It also depends on other factors, including the rate of contact within a population and the duration of the infectious period. It\u0027s a situation-dependent value, so in one city the R0 might be higher and in another lower. It also assumes that the entire population is susceptible to the disease.So what does that look like, and how does it compare with other diseases?How does Covid-19 compare with other diseases?Here, you can see the same spread patterns generated based on the R0 for a range of pathogens in a range of situations, ranging from Spanish flu to the highly contagious measles, for which R0 has been estimated to range between 12 and 18.But the R0 is not the only important number. The effective reproduction number, R, is a value that takes into account the susceptibility of the population.Here, you can set the thresholds for different values and see the result using our simplified model. The reality of pandemics is far more complex but this does demonstrate the basic concepts underlying the spread of diseases.

While Boris Johnson continued to recover from his own coronavirus infection, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state who is deputising for him, should have the authority to take decisions, Blair said.I think in a situation where every day matters and where every day decisions have to be taken, I think the person who is the acting prime minister along with what is essentially the war cabinet - the top four ministers that are meeting together - that person has got to be taking those decisions. You can’t have a void of decision-making.The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair has restated his call for the government to change the way it operates as it addresses the coronavirus crisis.

Speaking on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Blair said this is one of the lessons he learnt from handling the foot-and-mouth crisis. He explained:To be frank about it, for the first few weeks we were behind the curve, but what I learnt is that you just have to set aside all the normal rules and bureaucracy and just reposition the government differently ...All of us know people who are serious people with capabilities to offer who have been trying to fight their way into the system to offer them - and that is what makes me think we are not yet organised in the right way for the scale of this thing so that every possible avenue is being explored.The mayor of London has called on the UK government to ban evictions over arrears built up by renters as a result of the coronavirus emergency, with millions facing falling into debt with their landlords because of lost work and high rents.In an announcement today, Sadiq Khan also called for an increase to housing benefits, and an undertaking that the government would cover, for the duration of the crisis, any shortfall in payments by private renters, including those with no recourse to public funds. Demanding a “triple lock” protection for renters, Khan said:With millions of low-paid renters in London now facing increased financial uncertainty we face a ticking time bomb of debt, arrears and widespread evictions once the suspension in court proceedings is lifted.Failing to bring in more support for renters will not only result in widespread financial hardship, but risks increasing the public health crisis, as renters may feel forced to return to work too soon, with increasing debt and arrears hanging over their heads.Three million people in London rented privately, more than the number who owned a home with a mortgage in the city, Khan’s office said. Last week the  reported on research suggesting millions of UK renters may already be having to choose between paying rent and buying food and other essentials. The polling by Opinium found six in 10 renters had already taken a financial hit as a result of the crisis. Amina Gichinga from the London Renters Union said landlords were still threatening evictions, despite their halt for the duration of the crisis and official guidance urging them to “show compassion” to tenants. She said:Lots of people feel they have no choice but to break social distancing guidelines and go out to work, in many cases becoming seriously ill. People must be able to prioritise their safety, health and paying for food and other essentials over rent.We’re glad to see that Sadiq is listening to what we and other organisations in the renters movement are saying and joining us in calling for protections for renters who get in to rent debt during the coronavirus pandemic. The government must immediately suspend all rent payments and introduce measures that waive rent debt.Chris Bryant, the Labour MP whose question about the EU’s ventilator procurement scheme led to Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, telling the foreign affairs committee that the UK’s decision not to get involved was a “political decision”, is now saying the committee should investigate exactly what happened. As reported earlier (see 8.31am), Bryant has already said that he does not find the retraction issued by McDonald a few hours after the hearing at all credible.Here is the key passage in McDonald’s retraction letter.The facts of the situation are as previously set out. Owing to an initial communication problem, the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join in four joint Covid EU procurement schemes. As those four initial schemes had already gone out to tender we were unable to take part.Earlier Helen Whately, the care minister, said that the confirmed number of NHS staff who have died from coronavirus was 61.

Bryant says he does not believe McDonald’s retraction of his claim that the decision was political. Whately told BBC Breakfast that 61 NHS staff were known to have died after becoming infected with the coronavirus.We know that 61 NHS workers have died and for care workers I have a figure of 15, but we are working to get more comprehensive data on that because it is important for us to know the number of people in health and care who are dying of this.Earlier she told Sky that she was working to provide more up to date data on deaths in care homes by next week. The latest back dated figures from the ONS showed that Covid-19 fatalities in care homes in England and Wales have more than quadrupled in a week, rising to 1,043.’s Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, points out that EU officials have not confirmed Matt Hancock’s claim that the UK has joined the latest EU medical equipment procurement round.The FT estimates that the true number of those who have died from coronavirus in the UK is 41,000 - more than double the current official total. Chris Giles, the FT’s economics editor, has explained the calculation. The care minister, Helen Whately, has confirmed that some PPE supplies from Turkey have arrived at RAF Brize Norton. She also insisted the initial decision to opt out of an EU procurement scheme was not political.Speaking to Sky News she said:The plane has now arrived bringing really vital PPE with it.

What we know with these deliveries is that they do not always have exactly what you expect.On the EU scheme she saidThere do seem some misunderstandings about the EU scheme. I am assured there was no political decision about the involvement in itThe reason we weren’t involved in the initial scheme was to do with a communications error. We are now participating in one EU scheme and ready to participate in future schemes.The important thing is making sure that we are getting the PPE that we need.Stephen Hawking’s ventilator has been donated to the Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge to help treat patients with coronavirus.The physicist, who had motor neurone disease, died in 2018, aged 76.Our father received brilliant, dedicated and compassionate medical care from both Royal Papworth and Addenbrooke’s Hospitals in Cambridge.As a ventilated patient, Royal Papworth was incredibly important to my father and helped him through some very difficult times.We realised that it would be at the forefront of the Covid-19 epidemic and got in touch with some of our old friends there to ask if we could help.Welcome to our UK coronavirus live blog.

And Brussels sources have told the BBC that the UK was given ample opportunity to part in an EU scheme to source medical equipment.Sir Simon McDonald, the permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, told MPs that the decision to opt out was political. But he was then forced to retract the claim within hours after he was contradicted by the health secretary, Matt Hancock.But commentators have picked over the strange wording of McDonald’s retraction.Meanwhile, an RAF plane, believed to be carrying a delayed consignment of personal protective equipment for NHS staff, has landed in the UK.The plane had been dispatched from the Oxfordshire base, where two other planes are on stand-by to pick up further kit from Turkey. It is not known if the consignment, which was ordered on Thursday and originally due to arrive on Sunday, includes 400,000 badly-needed surgical gowns.Later on Wednesday, Labour’s new leader, Keir Starmer will quiz the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, over the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis during the first virtual Prime Minister’s Questions.Starmer is expected to spend his first PMQs as Labour leader questioning Boris Johnson’s stand-in over testing, safety equipment for frontline workers and an exit strategy from the lockdown."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4234591.1587505252!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert likely to get under way on july 29th minister says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Joe McHugh says the Leaving Cert is likely to get under way on Wednesday, July 29th.

Predicted gradesOn the question of whether students could have been given predicted grades, along with the option of sitting exams in autumn, Mr McHugh said this would have introduce two options and a “big, big decision” had to be made,In relation to the digital ide and students losing out, he said he hoped to be in a position to make an announcement on this shortly.He said his department has been in talks with the Department of Communications over access to mobile data for students who do not have broadband."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4234379.1587487206!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ten pupils per class hourly handwashing what reopened schools could look like","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrimary school children sit at desks spaced about two yards apart, in Logumkloster, Denmark.

Children can only play with a limited number of others during breaktime. Sharing of lunch is not allowed. There is handwashing every hour or so. And the drop-off and collection of children takes place at intervals.Marco Damgaard, the school principal, says public health experts, parents, teachers and educators helped review and prepare the reopening plan.“It’s an absolute quality stamp,” he said. “There are a lot of questions from parents and employees who need to be answered and that is only quite understandable... Clear and constructive communication between adults is crucial to the well-being, safety and learning of children.”In Ireland, officials are drawing up a pathway for the potential reopening of schools subject to public health advice.Current restrictions apply until May 5th. Well-placed sources say it is highly unlikely schools will reopen then, but the likelihood of primary schools reopening in June should become clearer.Internet accessMinister for Health Simon Harris said at the weekend his personal preference was for primary schools to reopen for up to one day a week before the end of the academic year.Principals and teachers have all signalled that they are ready to assist with school opening in line with the guidance of public health advice.Páiric Clerkin of the Irish Primary Principals’ Network says an easing of the restrictions to facilitate safe access by school staff in the short term should be considered first.This, he says, would ensure that critical leadership and management responsibilities can be fulfilled.“This would help those for whom access to the internet at home has been problematic and school leaders and administrators who need direct access to school systems and physical documents to comply with legal obligations such as forms that must be returned to the Department of Education by the end of April, as well as recruitment-related matters,” he says.John Boyle, general secretary of the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation, says school reopening is feasible – subject to public health advice – but warns there will be major challenges.Small rural schools, he says, have issues with transport and trying to accommodate four or five classes in the one classroom.Class sizesAverage class sizes at primary level in Ireland have about 25 pupils but can be much higher. This compares to average class sizes of about 19 in Denmark.“We would want to work with whatever advice is forthcoming, we’d want to plan it out appropriately, if a school opened for the morning for half the class, that half would go home rather than go to the playground and then the next half would come in after there would be a deep clean of the school,” he said.Secondary schools – which finish up at the end of May – look set to remain shut, apart from a two-week period in July for Leaving Cert students preparing for exams.During these two weeks, classes will be split and take place subject to social-distancing rules. This may prove to be a template for how schools resume in September.Clive Byrne of the National Principals and Deputy Principals Association says schools will have to rethink issues such as integral aspects of school such as transport, school matches, assemblies.“Our schools are designed to accommodate classes of up to 30 or so children, they aren’t designed for social distancing,” he says.“So, will we be able to have 20-plus children in a room? Or will we need to split up the class and have some taught remotely in another room? These are all matters we’re going to have to discuss.”Prof Sam McConkey of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and a specialist in infectious diseases, says public health authorities will likely be guided by whether we make good progress in meeting a list of six criteria set by the World Health Organisation before opening schools.These criteria include co-operation with public health measures, testing capacity and measures to help prevent re-infection.“We’re making good progress on some of those, but we have a lot to do on others,” he says.The good news, he says, is that the latest indications from data collected in Iceland and elsewhere are that children are not “super-spreaders”.“Children aren’t the problem,” he says. “They have significantly lower infection rates. So, reopening schools should be completely doable.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4233580.1587407409!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"china based corkman in the right place at the right time for ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Paul O’Brien used his expertise to procure PPE to send from China to Ireland. Photograph: Angela Ponce  BloombergWhen the Green Jersey awards are being handed out for service during the national pandemic there is sure to be one with the name of Dr Paul O’Brien on it.A China-based doctor and regulatory expert, Dr O’Brien could be said to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time when the Covid-19 outbreak started in that country at the beginning of the year. However, the 35-year-old Corkman proved to be the right man in the right place for Ireland when the disease started heading to Europe and he realised he could play a major role in our efforts to deal with the crisis. He first came to public attention when he wrote an open letter online to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and HSE boss Paul Reid in early March critiquing aspects of the national response to the pandemic. Based on his conversations with Chinese medics, he believed – correctly – that Europe was at the time sleepwalking itself into a crisis.“I was very worried because I had been in touch with Chinese docs and they said we seemed not to know what we’re in for.”But whereas others might have preferred to hurl on the ditch, O’Brien, eschewing an overtly political approach, has been of enormous practical assistance in sourcing help from China to bring to bear on the emerging crisis back at home.When the disease was still confined to China, he had been involved in trying to source personal protective equipment for local doctors from Europe. Now, he used his expertise to procure PPE to send from China to Ireland.Cork rootsFrom Montenotte, he got in touch with fellow Corkmen, GP Nick Flynn and respiratory consultant Oisin O’Connell. A WhatsApp group was set up which has become a lively forum for sourcing equipment and exchanging ideas on how best to address problem areas as the pandemic approached. Many of the supply issues for PPE and ventilators were solved through contacts on this group.O’Brien organised teleconferences in which Chinese doctors from Wuhan shared their expertise in fighting coronavirus. Another Corkman, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, was brought in to lend “gravitas” and help nail deals for the supply of equipment.He also translated a 146-page protocol used in a Chinese hospital so it could advise Irish hospitals on how best to treat patients with the virus.Meanwhile, O’Brien’s own life is on hold. Having studied genetics and food science, he had gone to China to train as a doctor at Zhejiang University. He is now married to a local woman and they have a young child. He had been due to travel to the US to do his final exams for practising medicine there but this was scuppered by the pandemic. And while he has applied to Ireland On Call, his Chinese qualifications are unlikely to be recognised quickly enough back at home.He is, however, optimistic that Ireland will succeed in curbing the advance of the virus and that a vaccine will be developed more quickly than many people expect.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA Wire. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said the Covid-19 support payments would likely be “tapered” and “changed” when the 12 week period is up. The Covid-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme, which started on March 26th, allows employers to continue to pay their employees during the crisis. It is set to end on May 7th. The Pandemic Unemployment Payment of €350 a week applies to people aged between 18 and 66 who have lost their jobs due to the crisis. Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland on Wednesday, Mr Donohoe said:“I think it’s very likely when I get to that 12 week period I will be tapering and changing it. But the nature of that decision will depend on where we are with the economy and where we are with Covid-19.“Many of the measures that we have in place at the moment from an economic point of view - we cannot sustain them indefinitely, but we will be able to sustain them for long enough to allow incomes to continue to be protected where possible and to give over 40,000 companies that are currently in our income subsidy scheme a fighting chance of returning to economic and business health.”The country is facing “considerable economic challenges,” but he and the Taoiseach want to avoid cuts to social welfare rates.The Minister predicted that peak unemployment will reduce to 14 per cent by the end of the year. “As we go into next year it should drop further.”Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Donohoe said the coronavirus crisis had resulted in a “severe recession” with unemployment soaring to a record 22 per cent – an economic shock without precedent in modern times.Mr Donohoe said his department was predicting unemployment to hit 22 per cent in the second quarter, “the highest level on record”, before easing back thereafter.The overall fiscal cost of the virus in exchequer terms would also be significant with the Government now expecting to run a deficit of 7.5 per cent or €23 billion this year, instead of a surplus of €2.2 billion, which had been forecast at the start of the year. This corresponds to a €25 billion reversal in the public finances.Easing restrictionsThe deaths of another 44 patients – 18 males and 26 females – diagnosed with Covid-19 were reported on Tuesday by NPHET.There have now been 730 Covid-19 related deaths confirmed by laboratory tests in the Republic. However, a further 108 probable or suspected deaths in care settings was reported by NPHET on Tuesday.NPHET also reported 388 new confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases now stands at 16,040.The Government is considering an easing of restrictions every two to three weeks after a possible initial easing off from May 5th. This would allow for an assessment of how any changes were affecting the spread of the virus.Some easing of cocooning measures for the over-70s, as well as the re-opening of DIY stores, are seen as the likeliest options for the first wave, as well as clarity on how schools could partially reopen. People may also be allowed travel further to exercise, it was suggested.Minister for Education Joe McHugh on Tuesday night said the Leaving Certificate could start on July 29th.Speaking on RTÉ’s Prime Time on Tuesday night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Government would outline its plan before May 5th and it would be considered by Cabinet by the end of April. In advance of any such move, the Government on Tuesday announced it was extending a ban on mass licensed gatherings of more than 5,000 people until the end of August, giving event organisers notice that concerts and other festivals were off for the summer.Spit hoodsMeanwhile, the chairperson of the Policing Authority Bob Collins told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that he wants “explicit guidelines” about the circumstances in which the spit hoods can be used on teenagers.Mr Collins said the authority was worried that garda procedures state only that the hoods are not to be used on children under 12 and was “silent” on their use on children aged 12-18.He said he had requested clarification from Garda Commissioner Drew Harris on the issue and wants the use of spit hoods to be recognised as a “use of force”, which requires a process of open reporting.Mr Collins also said he was “somewhat reassured” by the Commissioner’s “clear indication” that the use and availability of anti-spit hoods will be strictly limited to the current crisis.He also disputed the accuracy of figures “in the public domain” about the number of spit hoods that have been ordered, but did not clarify the number.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Technology alerts staff members remotely if their body temperature gets too highTemperatures set to hit 21 degrees with sunny conditions for coming daysRetired GP says they were unable to fly from Cusco because he had contracted Covid-19Joe McHugh says predicted grades ruled out due to \u0026lsquoinherent bias\u0026rsquo and lack of fairnessTrade union says lack of Government progress on issue creating additional problemsRally by former workers was broken up, but large gathering was let remain in courts buildingContact tracing cannot begin until initial call is madeCoronavirus: Specialist says he has received reports of \u0026lsquostrong-arm tactics\u0026rsquo by some hospitalsNeasa Hourigan states the predictions are \u0026lsquonot a good reason to stay out\u0026rsquo of a coalitionVaradkar says by end of April Cabinet will have considered plan to reopen societyTaoiseach says he will consider further restrictions on people travelling to IrelandThings could have been different if residents and staff were tested for Covid-19, owner statesVaradkar defends \u0026lsquoaspirational\u0026rsquo FG-FF policy planVaradkar hopes to be able to announce the lifting of some restrictions on May 5thFatality toll reaches 216 as Stormont ided over calls to reopen council-run cemeteriesAdvice issued by Department of Health to front-line personnel dealing with patientsCommunity fearful that rampant virus will spread from hotel site into local populationTomasz Zalewski claims he was unfairly dismissed from his job at discount storeCon Houlihan once described him as \u0026lsquoprobably the funniest man at large in Ireland\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

Photograph: Collins CourtsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he had agreed with Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin that no decision on a rotating taoiseach or the allocation of ministerial portfolios would be taken until they could also be discussed with a third coalition partner.Speaking on RTE’s Prime Time on Tuesday night, Mr Varadkar accepted that the document agreed between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil on the formation of a new Government was “aspirational” but said it was specifically designed not to act as a “fait accompli” to be presented to any other coalition partner.Tánaiste Simon Coveney, meanwhile,\u0026nbsphas suggested a government may not be formed until mid-June.Mr Varadkar expressed hope that potential coalition partners like the Green Party, Social Democrats, Labour and groups of independent TDs were “up for this” as the country needed a stable government.On housing, the Taoiseach said he believed it would be realistic to provide 10,000-12,000 new social housing units each year over the next five years.Asked if he had a preference about becoming Taoiseach first under the new Government, Mr Varadkar replied: “It sounds like a line but it really is true - it so isn’t about me I will do this job to the best of my ability for so long as I hold it.”Mr Varadkar said it would be a privilege to act as Taoiseach but warned that forming a Government now was “not for the faint hearted” as the as the country faced a very different situation to the time of the general election.A six-strong group of Independent TDs have said they would have an open mind about joining a Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael-led coalition ahead of their first meeting with both parties last night.The Rural Group of Deputies said they had no principled objection to going into government, but did not know if the two larger parties wanted them as part of its coalition.“If they want us, if they are really interested in us becoming part of their government, we will find out about it tonight,” said the Tipperary TD Mattie McGrath ahead of the meeting in Agriculture House on Kildare Street.Kerry TD Michael Healy-Rae said afterwards that he opposed any increases in taxes to lower climate emissions as is being talked about by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens. He said now was not the time to be making such suggestions.The Rural Group is the third group of Independents to meet Fine Gael, which was represented at the talks yesterday by Paschal Donohoe, and Fianna Fáil’s Dara Calleary since Monday. The rural group is composed of Mr McGrath, Michael Healy-Rae, Danny Healy-Rae, Richard O’Donoghue, Michael Collins and Carol Nolan. Privately, sources from the two larger parties have expressed doubt that the Rural Group as a whole would be a realistic partner for them in government.Third-party involvementIn talks, Fine Gael’s Simon Coveney has been putting huge emphasis on his party’s insistence that it does not want to go into a coalition unless a third party is involved. It is understood that Mr Coveney was asked by Michael Lowry of the Regional Group on Monday if Fine Gael had a plan B in the event of not securing support from a third party. He did not respond to the question.The Fine Gael “reference group” chaired by Richard Bruton also met on Tuesday afternoon. This comprises the party’s Ministers Minister of State Helen McEntee party chairman Martin Heydon South MEP Seán Kelly and Councillors Barry Saul and Michael Murphy.The group has the task of assessing what is agreed by Fine Gael negotiators during government-formation talks to ensure it accords with Fine Gael principles.Meanwhile, the Green Party is expected to publish its response to the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil framework document by the end of the week. The party criticised its vagueness and will seek clarity on some of the key measures, particularly in relation to climate change.One of its TDs said the response would be more of a document than questions as there were “a lot of things that were not addressed” in the framework document that should have been.At a meeting of the Fine Gael executive council last night, Mr Coveney suggested a government may not be formed until mid-June. He also told those at the meeting that Fine Gael had no need to fear an election if that was the only option.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest: RAF plane returns with PPE - but over half of vital stock remains in TurkeyArmed police respond to \u0026#39man firing machine gun from balcony\u0026#39 in ChathamUS top health official warns Covid-19 second wave could be \u0026#39even more destructive\u0026#39Iran\u0026#39s proxies swoop in to tackle coronavirus for propaganda victory Coronavirus Q\u0026ampA: What is PPE and how can it help NHS workers?

Truth be told, in any scenario, I don\u0027t do \u0027single\u0027 drinks. Two glasses of wine is my minimum. I live with a friend who is aligned with me on this front, so each evening we open a nice bottle to accompany dinner. Never once, in all the time we\u0027ve been under the same roof, have we found need to put the cork back in before retiring to bed.Which is to say that I definitely consume half a bottle a night, which is five units, which is double what the NHS deems to be acceptable for a woman.I\u0027m probably not alone in this. Indeed, it is so very British that even in a global pandemic, when our borders are sealed and everything from restaurants to churches have been shut down, that off-licences are still deemed \u0027essential\u0027. In South Africa, alcohol has been banned altogether during lockdown. Can. You. Imagine? The British public has been really very compliant with the restrictions placed on our lives and livelihoods throughout these drastic times, but consider, for a moment, the reaction were Dominic Raab to announce that from tomorrow, all shelves would be stripped of booze for the foreseeable future. I predict a riot. Our government, thank goodness, wouldn\u0027t dream of it. Historically speaking (and daily, for many at the moment) alcohol runs through our blood. During the medieval period, water was unsanitary, and so instead we drank ale. Everyone was a bit trollied, all the time.In the East, incidentally, rather than ferment water to make it safe, they boiled it to make tea, which explains why Asians still typically have a much lower tolerance to alcohol and possibly why they got so much more done than Europeans back in those Dark Ages. It\u0027s always been legal here in the West - the only exception being when the Lutherans outlawed it (ultimately unsuccessfully) in the US during Prohibition in the 1920s. Their intentions were noble namely to tackle alcoholism and violence. And of course, if such a substance were invented today, it would be a Class A drug - alcohol very much does incite addiction and aggression. It is no surprise then, that since South Africa banned it during lockdown, there have been 9,000 fewer alcohol-related hospital admissions a week.Anyway, alcohol has long been both legal and essential in British society, for better or worse, and has long been essential to me. It coloured my teenage years and was a cohort through my 20s. It has elevated dinner parties and enhanced holidays. It has provided the Dutch courage I\u0027ve required to deliver wedding speeches and to talk to people I fancy without going red. It is not the bedrock of my personality, but as one oft-quoted meme goes, \u0027No, Karen, you don\u0027t need alcohol to have fun. You don\u0027t need running shoes to run either, but it sure helps.\u0027It has certainly helped me during lockdown, chiefly as the daily punctuation mark between work and \u0027home\u0027 time - now otherwise one in the same thing. My father - a lawyer who practises from his house on a hill in the middle of nowhere and is thus well-versed in a life of isolation - has always poured himself a glass of whiskey every evening at 6pm when the grandfather clock chimes, to toast the end of office hours. I have adopted the same habit. So that\u0027s half a bottle of wine and a whiskey a day. At least. I can easily polish off a whole bottle of Côtes du Rhône myself should the circumstances call for it.In the strange new-normal in which we now find ourselves, where we don\u0027t really get a change of scene, that nightly elixir at least transports our neurological matter to a different state from work-driven focus to sofa-appropriate platitude. I have a restless mind, and tend to pace like a cat when I\u0027m bored. Lockdown can be boring, and part of alcohol\u0027s enduring appeal is that it takes down the intelligence a few notches. So I can think less and potter, like a dog. It is truly the one reliable pleasure I look forward to each day. Perhaps most significantly of all, I am, like my father, one of those lucky few who don\u0027t really suffer hangovers - not unless I get well and truly hammered, which is very rare, and even then not if I have a decent lie-in.So what\u0027s the problem, you might say? Too many units a day, that\u0027s the problem worthy of a good finger-wagging from the GP. It\u0027s bound to catch up with me at some point. That tolerance will only creep higher. Most years, I do Dry January for this very reason. Sometimes, after a particularly excessive holiday, I have a little chat with myself, and agree to take a week off so as to reset the meter. That time has come again. If you\u0027ve seen the 1989 cult classic that is Withnail and I, you\u0027ll know what I mean when I say that while Withnail\u0027s drunken countryside antics are all very amusing for the majority of the film, it is not, for him, a very happy ending. I choose, therefore, to be his (only slightly) more responsible companion, Marwood, and wind up back at work when this quasi-holiday is over, not morose, swigging wine alone in a park.And so for the next seven days, it\u0027s the sober life for me. Dinners will be a little less enjoyable. The days will, I imagine, feel longer. But unless Leonardo DiCaprio shows up at my door for a surprise visit, I at least won\u0027t have to worry about going red in front of someone I fancy. The sensible thing, after I\u0027ve completed this period of abstinence, would then be to have an end-of-work whiskey not every day, but every other day. And to have one glass of wine with dinner, only three days a week. But these are unpredictable times. It would be rash to make such grandiose promises.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

He previously held the position of political head of the North’s military under the young leader. In 2019, he was one of three senior officials sanctioned by the US for human rights abuses. Choe is often seen at high-level events with Pak Pong Ju, a fellow politburo member and former state premier who oversaw the North’s push to introduce more free market functions to revive its economy and help it survive sanctions, and who would likely keep his influential role. Kim Yong Chol, a party vice chairman and former top nuclear envoy who previously served as intelligence chief, would be an obvious choice to help lead the country’s international diplomacy efforts, including the stalled denuclearisation talks with Donald Trump, the US president. Kim would likely be supported by his former right-hand man Ri Son Gwon, the recently appointed foreign minister, who previously led high level talks with South Korea and who is an experienced hand in military talks after serving as a senior colonel in the national army.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/04/16/TELEMMGLPICT000229681714_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth","title":"need talk uncomfortable link obesity coronavirus","story":"Have fears of becoming a Nanny State stopped us confronting Britain\u0026#39s obesity problem?Let\u0027s launch a national diet campaign now to save livesFor a month we have been looking at international stats on Covid-19 trying to piece together the puzzle. Men are worse affected than women, older people are more likely to suffer, those with underlying health issues are especially vulnerable, and BAME groups are disproportionately represented among critically ill patients.Still, one pattern that has stimulated less discussion is the number of critically ill Covid-19 patients who are overweight or obese.The scientific journal Nature stated on April 2nd: “Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension are the most common comorbidities in patients with coronavirus infections. Emerging evidence demonstrates an important direct metabolic and endocrine mechanistic link to the viral disease process.”The same ailments keep emerging: diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Data from the first 2204 Covid ICU admissions show 73 per cent were overweight, a condition linked to those diseases.Not only does carrying more visceral weight put greater pressure on the lungs, excess body fat causes the immune system to dysfunction, instigating the cytokine storm that floods lungs causing pneumonia-like complications.For decades successive governments have been negligent in tackling obesity head on. Whether it’s subservience to the food and drink industry that contributes almost £30bn to the economy, or an aversion to becoming a Nanny State, obesity has ballooned without concerted intervention. More than half of the British diet is ultra-processed food with 60 per cent of the population overweight.The OECD places the UK the sixth most obese country in the world. South Korea, at the bottom of the table, has a far lower death rate from Covid-19.Approximately only one in eight Brits are metabolically healthy. The Government’s own statistics say obesity causes over 30,000 deaths each year, cuts an average nine years off life and makes an inidual more than twice as likely to develop high blood pressure and five times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes. The Department of Health estimates the cost of obesity to society is £27 billion a year, with annual spend on treatment greater than that spent on the police, fire service and judicial system combined.During normal times, a government might shy away from interfering in the contents of people’s fridges. But we have a national health emergency, and for once, a captive audience. Yet without bankable advice to physically prepare for the virus, supermarket shelves are devoid of flour and sugar while Mr Kipling has reported an astronomical sales surge.A controlled diet can start to reverse high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes in weeks. I can vouch for that. I am whipping a septuagenarian parent into shape, and in three weeks, they have lost three kilograms and have registered a marked change in blood pressure that should lead to coming off medication.For the first time in living history, the public are stuck at home cooking for themselves while glued to the airwaves desperate to know how to protect themselves. Changing habits is said to take three weeks, the time it takes to see improvement in metabolic health following significant dietary change. We have at least three weeks more of lockdown to come.Not only would a massive public campaign on diet save lives from Covid-19, it would change the course of our nation’s health forever.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

They shut at the same time as their Scottish counterparts.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/22/TELEMMGLPICT000229957589_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"missouri sues china handling coronavirus pandemic","story":"A woman holds a sign as she attends a rally outside the Missouri Capitol to protest stay-at-home orders put into place due to the Covid-19 outbreakThe state of Missouri filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the Chinese government over the coronavirus, alleging that nation’s officials are to blame for the global pandemic.The lawsuit, filed in federal court by the state’s top lawyer, alleges Chinese officials are “responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians.”Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt in a written statement said the Chinese government lied about the dangers of the virus and didn’t do enough to slow its spread.“The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of Covid-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease,” he said.They must be held accountable for their actions.”It’s unclear whether the lawsuit will have much, if any, impact. US law generally prohibits lawsuits against other countries with few exceptions, said Chimene Keitner, an international law professor at University of California, Hastings College of the Law.“The legal problem is, it’s just not possible,” said Keitner, who recently wrote a blog titled “Don’t Bother Suing China for Coronavirus.”Missouri Democratic Party Executive Director Lauren Gepford called the lawsuit a “stunt” by a Republican attorney general who is up for re-election this year.The number of Missouri deaths statewide rose by 16 on Tuesday to 215, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Centre for Systems Science and Engineering.

This means producers have access to large, mobile oil tankers and are not reliant on inland storage facilities which are close to full.The falls highlight huge excess supply of oil as demand has fallen by around 30 per cent because of measures taken to tackle Covid-19.While planes have been grounded, large parts of industry have been shut down and millions of people ordered to stay at home, oil producers have continued to pump out crude.Governments in some countries have tentatively begun to loosen lockdown controls but deep uncertainty remains about the global economy\u0027s future.Should environmentalists rejoice or despair over negative oil prices?Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit, warned that negative oil prices indicated a wider economic problems.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Government orders to stay at home mean that most drivers will feel little benefit from falling prices however.Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, said the average prices for litres of petrol and diesel should be 98p and 106p. He claimed that the UK\u0027s fuel suppliers had dishonestly held back falls in wholesale costs which took place last month.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The company wrote down the value of its stock by £243m.Mr Weston said that when stores can reopen, “we must make our Primark stores safe for our staff and our customers, even if that means ensuring there are fewer people shopping at any one time and so accepting lower sales at least until the remaining risk is minimal”.“In time we can rebuild the profits. We can’t replace the people we lose.”Home furnishings chain Cath Kidston confirmed on Tuesday that its 60 stores will not reopen after the coronavirus lockdown ends, with just 32 out of 940 employees to keep their jobs.The brand will continue after a deal with the one of the retailer’s shareholders, Baring Private Equity Asia (BPEA), which will buy the online business, brand and wholesale arm from administrators Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal.With unemployment set to soar, the government needs a ‘Cobra for jobs’Melinda Paraie, chief executive officer of Cath Kidston, said: “While we are pleased that the future of Cath Kidston has been secured, this is obviously an extremely difficult day as we say goodbye to many colleagues.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No island is an island. No person is an island. We are one large human community sharing the same planet. This pandemic has highlighted the fact that long-term inidualism just doesn’t work.She continues: “We have all had a stark lesson in the need to embrace community. We need to look out for and look after each other because if one hurts, then we all hurt.”What to read to stay sane during the coronavirus pandemic‘The Grapes of Wrath’ shows how far kindness can endurePhilip Pullman says MPs should be charged if PPE delayed over politicsBlackman goes on to say that once the pandemic is over we “all have a choice”.“Do we go back to the system we had before, where inidualism and ‘pulling up the ladder’ were applauded and lauded, or do we try to adopt a more caring, communal attitude, understanding that the fate of our neighbours is inexorably linked to our own?” she says.“The Covid-19 crisis has proved that the latter is not just possible, not just desirable, but necessary for our mutual long-term societal survival.”In another essay,\u0026nbspHis Dark Materials\u0026nbspauthor Philip Pullman said Conservative ministers should “face charges” if it emerges that the UK did not join an EU scheme for PPE “for political reasons”.“It’s all got to change,” he says. “If we come out of this crisis with all the rickety, fly-blown, worm-eaten old structures still intact, the same vain and indolent public schoolboys in charge, the same hedge fund managers stuffing their overloaded pockets with greasy fingers, our descendants will not forgive us.”A donation of £10,000 towards booksellers affected by Covid-19 has been made on behalf of the authors taking part in the Penguin series.

Netflix had predicted it would add 7 million during the period.The company warned that it expected fewer new subscribers from July to December compared with a year earlier, however. Many people who would have joined then are likely to have already signed up, executives said.Tiger King is one of Netflix’s biggest ever showsWe expect viewing to decline and membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends, Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.The company is among the few businesses to benefit from government orders imposed in March to keep people away from each other in order to stop the spread of the highly infectious novel coronavirus. While the S\u0026ampP 500 Index has fallen 19 per cent\u0026nbspfrom its 19 February record high, Netflix has gained 11 per cent\u0026nbspduring the same period.Netflix also issued a bullish forecast that it would add 7.5 million new customers for the current quarter, which ends in June, though the company said it was mostly guesswork given uncertainty over when stay-at-home orders might be lifted. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected 3.8 million.Investing senior analyst Haris Anwar said Netflix\u0027s big gains showed it\u0027s the ultimate stay-at-home stock.That said, there\u0027s no guarantee that a global recession and increased competition won\u0027t hit Netflix in the latter part of the year, Anwar said. There\u0027s little clarity from the company about the future, and that\u0027s likely to hurt the stock in the short run.Netflix said the shutdown of film and TV production around the world had temporarily increased its free cash flow but could delay some programming by a quarter. In the second quarter, the impact will be modest and mostly will affect dubbing in various languages, the company said.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The company posted diluted earnings per share of $1.57, below the $1.65 consensus, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Total revenue rose to $5.77 billion from $4.52 billion. Analysts on average had expected $5.76 billion.Appreciation of the U.S. dollar, due partially to the coronavirus crisis, dragged on international revenue, the company said.In the quarter, Netflix true-crime documentary Tiger King, about a colorful Oklahoma zookeeper, became a cultural sensation.

This means producers have access to large, mobile oil tankers and are not reliant on inland storage facilities which are close to full.The falls highlight huge excess supply of oil as demand has fallen by around 30 per cent because of measures taken to tackle Covid-19.While planes have been grounded, large parts of industry have been shut down and millions of people ordered to stay at home, oil producers have continued to pump out crude.Governments in some countries have tentatively begun to loosen lockdown controls but deep uncertainty remains about the global economy\u0027s future.Should environmentalists rejoice or despair over negative oil prices?Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit, warned that negative oil prices indicated a wider economic problems.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Government orders to stay at home mean that most drivers will feel little benefit from falling prices however.Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, said the average prices for litres of petrol and diesel should be 98p and 106p. He claimed that the UK\u0027s fuel suppliers had dishonestly held back falls in wholesale costs which took place last month.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The company wrote down the value of its stock by £243m.Mr Weston said that when stores can reopen, “we must make our Primark stores safe for our staff and our customers, even if that means ensuring there are fewer people shopping at any one time and so accepting lower sales at least until the remaining risk is minimal”.“In time we can rebuild the profits. We can’t replace the people we lose.”Home furnishings chain Cath Kidston confirmed on Tuesday that its 60 stores will not reopen after the coronavirus lockdown ends, with just 32 out of 940 employees to keep their jobs.The brand will continue after a deal with the one of the retailer’s shareholders, Baring Private Equity Asia (BPEA), which will buy the online business, brand and wholesale arm from administrators Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal.With unemployment set to soar, the government needs a ‘Cobra for jobs’Melinda Paraie, chief executive officer of Cath Kidston, said: “While we are pleased that the future of Cath Kidston has been secured, this is obviously an extremely difficult day as we say goodbye to many colleagues.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We know in some cases it’s their only main meal for the day and they’re not able to get much else.How to support our campaign“I am seeing some scared elderly people on their own, so if I speak to them from the pavement, I’m just trying to reassure them and keep their spirits up,” he adds.Briana LeBold, 47, works in fashion production and was furloughed by her company soon after the lockdown began. She has been volunteering as a food delivery cyclist a few days a week.“I decided worrying about work isn’t going to change anything,” she says. “I thought what Made in Hackney and some of the food charities were doing was wonderful, so I just wanted to get involved to support the work.“There isn’t a huge amount of interaction with people, obviously, but they do let us know how much they’re enjoying the meals. Even if it’s just a wave and a ‘hi’ – it’s still really nice to see people and feel like you’re helping in some way.”Tais Lima, a 41-year-old yoga teacher, is volunteering one day a week. “I like getting out on my bike with a sense of purpose,” she says. “There’s a lot of lonely and vulnerable people out there, but it’s rewarding to see they’re getting a meal that changes their day.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her staff identified 420 iniduals and families in the London borough in dire need of food each day, and asked for volunteers to help drop off the vegan meals between 2pm and 6pm every afternoon.Kitchen staff at the Angelina restaurant in Dalston have helped with the cooking so they can meet a target of delivering 30,000 meals over the next three months.“We knew there was going to be this incredible level of need out there, so we ripped up our job descriptions and threw ourselves into this work,” says Ms Bentley. “It’s been pretty emotional at times, pretty intense to see what people are going through. We want to be able to help more people if we possibly can.”She told The Independent how one family had no food at all in the house for more than two days before they began getting daily meals out to them.One of those receiving a delivery each afternoon is David Pavlovic, a 63-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, who was told not to leave home for a 12-week period.“I’ve got family outside of London and friends across the city – but they have problems of their own with job losses,” he says.“I did get worried for a while about having enough food, so it was just a massive relief to get meals delivered. The charities like The Felix Project and Made in Hackney are doing really important work, and it seems like they enjoy doing it too.

In the four weeks since lockdown, they have delivered 565 tonnes – a staggering 1.35 million meals.This extraordinary humanitarian effort – carried out with 22 delivery vans manned by a small army of volunteers – comes in the wake of rising food poverty and worrying new research on unemployment. \u0026nbspThe Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex estimated at the weekend that at least 6.5 million jobs could be lost, a fifth of the national total, with the duration of the lockdown being critical as to whether job losses will be short-lived.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt comes on top of a YouGov poll for The Food Foundation revealing that 8 million people in Britain face food insecurity and that 3\u0026nbspmillion have already experienced hunger.As Felix scrambles to respond to the deepening distress with no government support, donations to our campaign, in conjunction with sister title the Evening Standard, are crucial to fund their fast-expanding operation.Today we can report a hugely generous donation from the Garfield Weston Foundation, who agreed to an emergency grant of £500,000 to be shared equally between The Felix Project and FareShare, London’s two biggest food surplus distributors, for their work supporting the most vulnerable families in the wake of the coronavirus.Our campaign raises over £1.5m for the vulnerablePhilippa Charles, director of the Garfield Weston Foundation, said: “Alongside significant grants to the National Emergency Trust among others, our trustees are keen to ensure that those most vulnerable and affected by this crisis receive the immediate support they need. We are delighted to support this partnership between two effective charities with which we have had long-standing relationships.”\u0026nbspAnother donor to our appeal, which is approaching £2m, was the Oso Foundation, whose trustee Karen Jankel, said: “Doing the weekly grocery shop may have its challenges for most of us, but at least we can afford to put food on the table. The ethos behind The Felix Project appeals to us as we hate the idea of waste and so by giving them our donation, we feel as though we’re making a small difference twice over.”On Friday, Felix delivered 16 truckloads of nutritious food to community hubs in eight boroughs –​ Barnet, Enfield, Haringey, Harrow, Havering, Islington, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest – and a further 26 truckloads to 75 charities, schools and holiday clubs. All in all, this is the daily equivalent tonnage of three-and-a-half double-decker Routemaster buses.With more borough hubs set to come on stream in the coming days, demand for their services is set to rise yet further.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help here.\u0026nbspFollow this link\u0026nbspto donate to our campaign in London, in partnership with the Evening Standard.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Labour claimed there had been a “shambolic” response to credible offers of vital kit from several companies.Health secretary Matt Hancock is set to face questions in the Commons about participation in an EU scheme to secure equipment, after the Foreign Office’s top civil servant Sir Simon McDonald made an extraordinary U-turn – withdrawing his own claim the UK made a “political decision” not to take part.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRaab faces Starmer at first ‘virtual’ PMQsHancock faces\u0026nbspquestions on EU procurement schemeBlair warns against ‘void in decision making’Lib Dems call for public inquiry into handling of crisisSadiq Khan calls for ‘triple lock’ rent protectionThe London mayor has called on the government to ban ‘no fault’ evictions during the lockdown, stop evictions after the lockdown based on rent arrears built up during the crisis, and also wants an increase in housing benefits.Calling it a “triple lock” for London’s three million private renters, Khan said: “With millions of low paid renters in London now facing increased financial uncertainty we face a ticking timebomb of debt, arrears and widespread evictions once the\u0026nbspsuspension in court proceedings is lifted.“The government must urgently put in place measures that will prevent private landlords from evicting tenants who go into arrears as a result of COVID-19.”Lib Dems call for public inquiryAn independent inquiry should be held into\u0026nbspBoris Johnson’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats have said.“Once we are through this crisis, there will of course need to be an independent inquiry to officially review the government’s response to the pandemic, so we can learn the lessons,” acting leader Sir Ed Davey said.“The inquiry must have the strongest possible powers given the shocking failures on protective equipment for staff and the slow response of the government - to get to the truth and to give Boris Johnson the opportunity to answer the increasingly serious questions.”NHS staff death toll reaches 61, says ministerSocial care minister Helen Whately\u0026nbsphas said that 61 NHS staff were known to have died after becoming infected with the coronavirus.“We know that 61 NHS workers have died and for care workers I have a figure of 15, but we are working to get more comprehensive data on that because it is important for us to know the number of people in health and care who are dying of this,” she told BBC Breakfast.“We have got to do everything we can to protect their lives.”This is only a partial picture, however, with the true total thought to be significantly higher. The PA news agency has verified 65 deaths of NHS staff across England, with over a dozen more reported deaths yet to be confirmed.PPE arrives from TurkeyAn RAF plane, believed to be carrying a delayed consignment of personal protective equipment (PPE) for NHS staff, has landed in the UK.It is not known if the consignment, which was ordered on Thursday and originally due to arrive on Sunday, includes 400,000 badly-needed surgical gowns.The social care minister Helen Whately has told the\u0026nbspToday programme the UK has also brought in 140,000 medical gowns from Myanmar this week and is expecting “millions” of face masks from China, in addition to the consignment that has arrived from Turkey.Whately\u0026nbspalso claimed there had not been a “political decision” made that Britain should not to become involved in EU procurement programmes to acquire equipment for dealing with the coronavirus outbreak.“There do seem some misunderstandings about the EU scheme. I am assured there was no political decision about the involvement in it,” she told Sky News.“The reason we weren\u0027t involved in the initial scheme was to do with a communications error. We are now participating in one EU scheme and ready to participate in future schemes.”Senior civil servant backtracks on EU scheme claimThe encouraging news about vaccine trials threatens to be overshadowed by rows over PPE and other vital equipment. According to\u0026nbsp this morning, the government has missed the chance to secure at least 16 million face masks in the past month.Hancock admitted at the latest Downing Street press conference there had been over 8,000 separate offers of PPE, but claimed not all companies could deliver “in scale”.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the Foreign Office’s permanent secretary Sir Simon McDonald\u0026nbspissued a letter last night saying\u0026nbspthe UK’s failure\u0026nbspto participate in the\u0026nbspEU procurement scheme for ventilators and PPE was a “political decision”.Hancock said the UK\u0026nbsphad\u0026nbspjoined the scheme on an “associate” basis – insisting the decision not to join earlier had “zero” impact on getting supplies.The health secretary\u0026nbspis due to make a statement in the Commons on Wednesday afternoon, and is sure to face tough questions on both testing and PPE.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGood morning and welcome to The Independent’s live coverage of events at Westminster and beyond, as Boris Johnson’s government faces new questions over its handling of the coronavirus crisis.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the scale does go higher...bahhhh”The earthquake occurred in the vicinity of the Newport-Inglewood Fault, which\u0026nbsphas long been considered one of Southern California’s top seismic danger zones, running\u0026nbspunder some of the region’s most densely populated areas.An average of five earthquakes with magnitudes between 3.0 and 4.0 occur per year in the greater Los Angeles area, according to recent data.Wednesday’s\u0026nbspquake occurred at a depth of 7.4 miles, USGS said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A similar note was left with the newborn abandoned in 2017.Based on the egregious and neglectful behaviour of the parent(s), and the bizarre facts of this case, unlike any other documented case, it is imperative to conduct a well-being check of all involved parties. This cannot be done without the assistance of United Data Connect.City commissioners approved the $5,000 funding on Monday to hire United Data Connect, which maintains a database of DNA profiles, to track down the parents.While initial testing had identified several possible family members of the babies, more specialised knowledge from a genetic genealogist was needed to interpret the DNA and determine the parents.Orlando police said in a statement on Tuesday that while the three infants were confirmed to be siblings, no other details could be shared to protect their identity.If we are able to identify the mother, her safety is our top priority, as well as the safety of any other potential children, the police statement said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

CNN then produced a report, citing US administration sources, that surgery had indeed taken place and Kim’s condition remained critical.According to some officials in South Korea and China\u0026nbsphowever, the rumours of Kim’s near death were much exaggerated. They had no information about a hospital stay, and,\u0026nbspclaimed that\u0026nbsphe was not in the mountains of Myohyang at all, but most likely at Wonsan, beside the sea. One official said that “nothing unusual” has been seen in the activities of the leader.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe last assertion can be questioned.\u0026nbspFor the first time as the head of state – the title of Chairman of State Affairs Commission – Kim had failed to take part in the annual flower laying ceremony on 15\u0026nbspApril to commemorate the birthday of his grandfather and the dynasty’s founder, Kim Il-sung, at the Kumsusan Palace, one of the most auspicious dates in the state’s official calendar.Kim Il-sung had died from a heart attack as had his son and heir Kim Jong-il.

He appeared unwell when he eventually surfaced, and evidence emerged later to indicate that he had suffered a stroke. In 2014\u0026nbspthe leader dropped out of sight for six weeks before emerging with a cane. South Korea’s intelligence agency said he had an operation to remove a cyst from his ankle.Pictures from the politburo meeting showed hundreds of members sitting in close proximity, leading to claims that Kim Jong-un had suffered not a heart attack, but\u0026nbspcoronavirus. North Korea has said it has\u0026nbsptested 700 people for the disease and put more than 500 in quarantine. But, it has insisted to the World Health Organisation (WHO) that it has\u0026nbspno cases of infection.What happened at the politburo has\u0026nbspadded to the political speculation around Kim’s supposed ill health. The leader used the meeting to carry out a reshuffle of the State Affairs Commission, replacing five of its 13 members. Among those to lose their posts were two influential figures, former foreign minister Ri Su Yong and diplomat Ri Yong Ho. The former army commander and new foreign minister, Ri Son Gwon, was brought into the committee.There is also a lot of\u0026nbspconjecture about the role of Kim Yo-jong, the leader’s sister. She would be the obvious stand-in if he were to be incapacitated for a period. Not only is she from the “Paektu blood line”\u0026nbspof the Kim dynasty she has emerged as the most important member of the regime after him.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was an important comeback for her after her star had temporarily fallen due to Kim Jong-un being unsatisfied with what was gained\u0026nbspfrom the summits with Donald Trump. Yo-jong is said to have helped persuade him to pursue detente after the two leaders had spent months hurling insults at each other and accompanied him to the meetings in Singapore and Hanoi.Yo-jong has also been reconfirmed in her post of first vice-director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department. Last month she made well publicised incursions back into public life, praising Trump for sending Kim a letter pledging to maintain bilateral relations and offering any help needed with coronavirus. She also attacked South Korea as a “frightened dog barking” after Seoul complained about the North resuming missile testing.Last December Yo-jong issued her first military order, sent to the army’s all-female units. There have been a spate of photographs showing brother and sister inspecting institutions and factories together and riding white horses at Mount Paektu, the sacred birthplace of the nation.The US Treasury placed Yo-jong under sanctions\u0026nbspthree years ago “in response to the regime’s ongoing and serious human rights abuses and censorship activities”. Western intelligence agencies also claim that she is a senior member of a government department which overseas illicit activities to raise foreign reserves including counterfeiting, cybertheft, drugs and arms sales.However, if Kim Jong-un’s health problems do turn out to be true, then it is Kim Yo-jong who emerges, for the time being at least, the custodian of power in North Korea. But fathoming just when this takes place, and for how long, will remain difficult to ascertain in a state which goes to such lengths to shut itself off from the outside world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

During a train stop in China early last year, she was given the job of extinguishing her brother’s cigarette.Some analysts said\u0026nbspthat she has the only real characteristic that matters in the North Korean system – being of the “Paektu blood line”, a direct descendent of the Kim dynasty.But North Korea is also a rigid patriarchy, and her gender would most likely rule her out as anything more than a caretaker leader in the event of her brother’s demise.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Like his brother, he also studied abroad in Switzerland.According to Kenji Fujimoto, the Japanese man who claims to have been the personal sushi chef for Kim Jong-il, the late North Korean leader\u0026nbspdecided Kim Jong-chol was too “girlish” to lead the country. It would seem to be a long shot for him to return to the fold of public life.The private life of North Korea’s first family is notoriously shrouded in mystery, but we do know that he has been married to former singer and cheerleader Ri Sol-ju since 2009.South Korea’s intelligence services believe the couple have had three children – including a son born in 2010, a daughter born around 2013 and third child in 2017.Bizarrely, perhaps the best insight into the Kim family came from the 2013 visit of US basketball star Dennis Rodman, who described Kim Jong-un as a “good dad” to his then-young daughter Ju Ae.Created with Sketch.Kim Jong-un: Decade in pictures of North Korean leader Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Kim Jong-un rides a horse during

that a form of regency would be required until his eldest son was old enough to take over.Nonetheless, US officials believe that keeping control of the country within the family is still the most likely outcome. Speaking on Fox News on Tuesday, Donald Trump’s national security adviser Robert O’Brien said of any succession: “The basic assumption would be maybe it would be someone in the family.”North Korea’s most senior officials have stayed in their jobs through unflinching loyalty to the Kim family, sometimes over multiple generations.In the event that new leadership is required, it is possible that several high-ranking Workers’ Party elders could team up to see the country through any transition.After decades of service including as Kim Jong-un’s first military chief, Choe Ryong-hae rose to be the North’s nominal head of state last year becoming the president of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly.He and Pak Pong-ju, a fellow politburo member and former state premier who oversaw the North’s push to introduce more elements of a free market to revive its economy, would be the likely figureheads of any collective leadership.In such a scenario, the former top nuclear envoy Kim Yong-chol and foreign minister Ri Son-gwon could be tasked with handling diplomatic issues including stalled denuclearisation talks with South Korea and Washington, as they played key roles in previous summits with Trump.“Kim now puts his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong in charge of many things, and she is the only sibling and trusted confidante inside his cabinet. Ultimately, though, it is his son who would inherit the kingdom,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They usually include:Hayfever sufferers may also experience itching around the face and mouth or an itchy feeling inside the roof of the mouth and a burning sensation in the throat.It may also cause headaches and wheezing, but these are less common symptoms, along with a sore throat.Some of the symptoms of coronavirus may cross over with hay fever in a few cases, so its worth understanding how to tell the dference.We asked allergy expert Max Wiseberg, of Haymax, to explain...He said: “If your mucus is clear, thin and watery it is more likely to be hay fever.”“And although it is called hay fever, a fever is unusual, whereas it is possible with coronavirus.”Max added: “Despite its name, hay fever is not contagious, whereas the coronavirus is -

and pollen can irritate the airways and worsen symptoms.Coronavirus is also a respiratory illness and is also understood to cause symptoms which can exacerbate asthma and increase the risk of potentially le-threatening attacks.Emma Rubach, head of health advice at Asthma UK, told The Sun Online: “Coronavirus can cause respiratory problems for anyone.But for the .million people in the UK with asthma, respiratory viruses bring an increased risk of asthma symptoms and potentially le threatening asthma attacks.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

especially beds and fabrics - to remove pollen particles.Dry your clothes indoors rather than outdoors to prevent pollen particles being blown onto the clothes by the outside wind.”You should also make sure any pets are well groomed and shampooed, as they can carry pollen particles in their fur, and keep them out of the room where you sleep.There are also conventional over-the-counter medicines which can combat hay fever symptoms.Antihistamine tablets and capsules can relieve most hay fever symptoms – sneezing, itchy, runny eyes, skin irritation, itchy nose and throat – but are less effective for nasal congestion, according to Max.Antihistamine nasal sprays can quickly ease itching, sneezing and watering but generally only proof against mild symptoms.Steroid nasal sprays and drops help reduce inflammation in the nose.They work best for clearing nasal symptoms – itching, sneezing, watering  congestion – and sprays sometimes clear eye symptoms too.Eye drops may reduce itchy, watering, swollen eyes.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.People may have a  sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, recently reviewed  studies which looked at the efficacy of face masks in preventing respiratory illness.He said the research was poor, adding that it was as easy to make an argument for opposing the widespread use of masks as it would be to make an argument promoting their use.Most experts are in agreement that for masks to work as they are intended, they must be used correctly.Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex, told the Mail: To be effective, a mask has to be fitted correctly, worn correctly and disposed of correctly — which is not something the general public has been trained in.She added that not wearing one correctly is potentially more hazardous than not using one at all, as you may infect yourself with the particles the mask is protecting you against when you take it off.The WHO says surgical masks can only help when used with other preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing.Here we take a look at some of the dferent types of face mask and how well they work...N respiratorsN masks are disposable face masks that are proven to filter the air to an industrial standard.Manufacturers y, but the N is a stamp from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to show that it is efficient.The N stands for Not resistant to oil, because the mask only protects against particles, not fluids while the  means it filters out  per cent of airborne particles.They generally have an -hour shelf le before becoming clogged depending on the work youre doing.As they offer so much protection, they are used by doctors and nurses in a medical setting.However, they have not been recommended for use to the general public yet due to supply issues for health workers.Surgical masksThese disposable -ply masks are fluid-resistant are the most common type of facial protection youll see health care staff wearing.They are used to prevent infected droplets from doctors, nurses and carers entering the respiratory system of the patient.Although they dont have built-in air filters, they are considered effective enough for most staff outside of intensive care.The nose clip can be bent to fit snugly around the nose however they are a loose fit and the material gapes at the sides so they dont protect against all particles.When they become wet, theyre effectiveness is also reduced.Also, they are disposable and are only intended to be worn once.DIY dust masks Found in most hardware stores, dust masks can offer some level of protection from particles -worn correctly.If it says FFP then it’s a basic kind of dust mask and offers the lowest level of filtration for this kind of respirators mask.To meet European standards, they have to be able to filter at least  per cent of particles - with FFP  filtering  per cent.That means that it can’t filter out tiny particles associated with viruses and bacteria.Short of being a full gas mask it offers the best protection - as long as it fits properly - and is more effective than an N as well as the FFP and FFP.Cycling masksThese are generally worn by cyclists to prevent them from breathing in pollution in heavy traffic.Usually made from neoprene, they fit tightly to the face and are intended to offer a level of protection from airborne particles.Some are also marketed as N, or N grade, which means the amount of filtered airbone particles is either  or  per cent.Homemade masksAs many people cant get their hands on a mask, some have turned to fashioning their own.Theres been tips on using vacuum cleaner bags and even sanitary towels to cover your face.While most wont be as effective as anything you can buy in a store, they will offer more protection than not covering your face at all.Research by Public Health England in  looked at the suitability of houeshold materials that could be used as maks to filter bacterial and viral aerosols and found vacuum bags actually worked well.Experts say that you should aim for multiple layers - a double layer of tightly-woven cotton with a thread count of at least  was one of the best barriers, according to researchers in the US.Even a bandana, scarf or T-shirt can be used to cover your nose and mouth while in public. The British public hasnt been advised to wear face masks to protect against coronavirus - unless youre caring for someone with the disease or you work on the frontline.Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Good Morning Britain: Masks are very important to protect healthcare workers...Butisnt something that weve done here because weve followed the advice.And weve followed the medical and scientic advice and the whole basis of our response has been making sure that we follow the science.However scientic advisers for the Government are carrying out a review of the use of face masks.Chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has also signalled that No could change its mind on the use of masks.Homemade masks wont offer the same level of protection as medical-grade ones, but it hasnt stopped DIY tutorials popping up online.One of the simplest ones involves using two layers of kitchen roll and one tissue cut in half.You then cover each end with masking tape - and you can even tape down some wire to stfen the mask,you have any.Finish by punching holes in each end and threading elastic through to fit around your ears.If you dont have elastic bands you could also use a hair tie.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

these are the straps that will go around your ears.Some people have also used a vacuum cleaner bag to create a face mask, which is a bit more complicated - and only worksyou have a spare, clean bag to hand.Officials in New York City are urging people to wear masks when they go outside.Mayor Bill de Blasio said coverings for the nose and mouth can be real homegrown and made from a scarf or bandana.It is believed new US Government guidance would suggest non-medical masks, T-shirts or bandanas be used to cover the nose and mouth when outside the home, while professional-grade masks are kept for healthcare workers.In Europe, Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bosnia-Herzegovina have introduced these measures.Residents in the Philippines have to wear a mask in public, and the same is true in some of the worst-affected provinces in China.In Japan, where masks were already a household staple, the government plans to post two gauze masks to each of the countrys  million households.People in Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan regularly wear masks because of air pollution.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His government has “made mistakes” — and so has ours.But presidents and prime ministers have a lot on their plates. When it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.It would take a very brave prime minister indeed to ignore the people appointed to safeguard the nation’s health when lives are at risk.And the advice from those experts — the sprawling Public Health England in particular — was that Britain faced no more than a larger-than-usual dose of winter flu.PHE was against German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial laboratories in providing those tests.PHE failed to build stocks of personal protective equipment — including masks, gowns and gloves — despite a  test run showing these were a priority.PHE dragged its feet over sourcing ventilators for intensive-care patients and extra hospital beds.Frequently when running short of crucial gear, PHE resisted offers of outside help, leaving the NHS scrambling to catch up.And when it came to opening London’s ,-bed Nightingale emergency hospital, it was the Army that did the job in nine days.It was also PHE who insisted the British public would be protected by “herd immunity”.The sooner  per cent of the population had contracted the virus and become immune, the better, it said.Boris faithfully followed their lead until another expert, Prof Neil Ferguson, issued a nightmare prediction of , dead unless Britain was locked up overnight.It was Ferguson who in the Blair years forecast mass burials on the scale of the Great Plague during the “Mad Cow” scare and the foot-and-mouth outbreak.Neither Armageddon scenario came remotely close.Once this is over and the inevitable inquiry is held, Boris and his government will inevitably be in the dock.So will PHE, a fiercely territorial quango with a giant £.billion budget.Much of this goes on pay and perks for well-cushioned executives, with  staff on six-figure salaries — a nanny-state rich list.Its website boasts its job is to “protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing”.And yet this box-ticking bureaucracy — obsessed with sugary drinks and ersity — has failed at the first hurdle.It shares with the higher reaches of the NHS a suspicion of fleet-footed commercial rivals and deep-seated hostility to the “profit motive”.Criticism, still muted, is widespread within the medical community, including frontline doctors and consultants.Every Thursday at pm, a grateful nation stands and applauds NHS staff working around the clock to save lives at the risk of their own.The same cannot be said for the inflexible, politically correct quango that binds the hands of medical staff in the name of an outdated socialist credo on health provision: State good, private bad.Much will need to change after Covid-. And that change must start with Public Health England.MINISTERS are looking at a traffic-light system to lt lockdown. Red for Stop, green for Go, with amber in between.Overzealous cops and councils are being reined in. ­Common sense is taking over. Families can now attend funerals.We might be able to say goodbye to dying ­relatives. Parks will reopen to the ­public.

On each phone there is an app that reports back to the authorities on the users’ health and online activities.Nor is there any escape in the home. The very concept of privacy barely exists when the state can use sophisticated technology to keep watch on our behaviour.This vision sounds like a nightmare, but it could become all too real thanks to the coronavirus.In its fallout, Covid- may end up causing as much damage to our essential freedoms as to our health - with the new menace of Big Brother on its way.Already the current emergency has led to the first comprehensive lockdown in British history.Evenit has been necessary to slow the spread of the virus, it is nevertheless a draconian measure that would have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago.Effectively the entire public has been placed under house arrest.Normal le has been brought juddering to a halt, while the police have been given unprecedented powers to enforce the quarantine.Even sitting for too long on a park bench or taking a leisurely drive have become offences against the state.With heroic stoicism, the vast majority of people have accepted this policy, seeing it as the only realistic means to protect the NHS and lessen the transmission of coronavirus.They hope that once the worst of the crisis has passed, there will be ato the Britain that they love, where inidual rights are respected and the power of the state is limited.Above all, this is my deepest wish too - though the chances look slim.One of the reasons why I, as an Irishman, admire this country so much is because of the British tradition of liberty, reflected in Magna Carta, parliamentary democracy and the defeat of Nazi tyranny.Unfortunately, even when the current lockdown is lted, it is possible that heavy-handed control by the state will remain.Quarantine may be temporary, but authoritarianism could be permanent.This is because officialdom, shaken by the unexpected scale of the coronavirus crisis, will be determined to prevent its resurgence by any means necessary.That will involve far more than just the maintenance of social distancing and the wearing of face masks.An arsenal of other measures could be deployed in the fight.One will be the reintroduction of curfews at the first sign of any new flare up in cases.If there is such a setback, the mood of the authorities will be even more intolerant towards any breaches. Fines will be heavier, jail terms longer.The skies will be filled with the sound of helicopters and the sight of drones as police — or even the Army — embark on ruthless enforcement.Another change is likely to be the advent of biometric identity cards, backed up by a comprehensive database of the entire population.Such a system has long been the dream of bureaucrats in Whitehall, and the aftermath of the crisis provides the perfect excuse for its imposition.Its appeal is all the greater because the latest type of cards operate with biotechnology that scans eyes and fingerprints.Only last year, the European Union passed a regulation requiring all national identity card systems on the continent to comply with new biometric standards.The British state will not stop there in its new crusade.In the name of health protection, mobile phone companies could be required to share data on their clients.According to the New Statesman, British Telecom, which owns the EE network, is already “in talks with the Government about handing over phone location and usage data” for the purpose of monitoring adherence to the lockdown.Similarly, tracking apps on devices could also be made obligatory so that the Government will be able to trace the contacts of anyone infected and ensure compliance with quarantine rules.Just as some criminals on release have to wear electronic tags, anyone who has tested positive for the virus may be ordered to wear a medical wristband even when self-isolation is over.Alternatively, those who test negative could be given immunity certicates.These initiatives will be accompanied by a political drive to reinforce support for the state, as happens in wartime.In a distinctly un-British way, people will be encouraged to snitch on those who fail to abide by the rules.Challenges to ruling orthodoxy will be seen as a form of subversion.If that sounds far-fetched, consider how laws to tackle discrimination or terrorism are now used to uphold fashionable ideology, as highlighted in the outrageous recent case where Lincolnshire businessman Harry Miller was questioned by police for allegedly sending a “transphobic” tweet.In the new Britain scarred by corona, the whole relationship between the state and the public will be inverted.The Government is meant to be accountable to the people.But, burdened with ID cards, curfews and tracking apps, the people will be accountable to the Government.There is an echo here of the George Orwell’s novel , which painted a terrying picture of Britain under totalitarian rule.In Orwell’s society gripped by permanent crisis, the citizenry were monitored day and night by the state.The propaganda and all-seeing eye of Big Brother could never be avoided, “always watching and the voice enveloping you, asleep or awake, indoors or outdoors, in the bath or in bed.In the present global crisis, many look to the experience of Asia, which has had far lower Covid death rates than the West.But that is a dangerous stance. First it ignores the fundamental point that China is responsible for the spread of this disease through its cover-up, persecution and lies.The country should be in the dock, not garnered with praise.Second it glosses over the oppressive nature of many of these Asian regimes, particularly that run by the tyrannical Chinese communist party.China has eagerly embraced new technology, like tracking devices, facial recognition cameras, eye-scanning security barriers and online data gathering, precisely because they drastically enhance the power of the state machine.Indeed, the country likes to boast that it is building the “world’s largest camera surveillance network”.As an example, in Guangzhou province, the commercial hub of southern China, tablets have been recently installed on buses to promote safety.Passengers are expected to lean their foreheads close to the tablet so that their photos and temperatures can be taken.China is also establishing a sinister “social credit system”, where behaviour is monitored to assess a citizen’s trustworthiness.Those given high ratings by the state can receive rewards like employment offers, shorter waiting times in hospitals and discounts at hotels.It is a recipe for bureaucratic despotism and political infantilisation.Other Asian nations, while nothing like as cruel as China, are also using technology as a tool to corral their public.Hong Kong has introduced mandatory wristbands for those in quarantine so they can be tracked.Taiwan has a monitoring system known as “the electronic fence” where those who are meant to be in isolation will be visited by the authoritiesthey turn off their mobiles.In South Korea, the government gathers huge amounts of data from phone records, CCTV images, and credit cards to help track citizens during the Covid crisis, while in Singapore, phone users are encouraged to download the “TraceTogether” app.This keeps a record of all the other numbers that have been in close proximity to the smartphone, making it easier to trace anyone who might have been near the owner in the event of a positive Covid-test.Not all of these developments are bad, provided they are genuinely used as weapons against disease rather than vehicles for the expansion of state power.But we have seen since   how the excuse of security can be used as a cover for bullying by the authorities, with the result that international air travel is often a miserable experience.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.We should not allow the same to happen on a national scale in the wake of the pandemic.As the great author C.S.Lewis wrote: “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.It would be better to live under robber barons than omnipotent moral busybodies.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is a faint irrationality behind it, just because there was a clamour for mass testing.Hancocks , target was a response to a criticism in the media and he decided to crank out tests regardless.Hes not had a good crisis. The Prime Minister will say he has confidence in him but it doesnt feel like that.But an ally of Mr Hancock said: Anyone who thinks Matt just walked into a No press conference and came out with his own figure doesnt have a clue how Government works.It was a Government target, arrived at by looking at what capacity there was in the NHS and the private sector and then setting an ambitious goal. The aim at the time was to get key workers who were self-isolating back to workthey did not have the virus.A No spokesman said: We agreed the figure before it was announced and it remains a Government target.In fact we have gone far further, raising millions for NHS staff via hero Captain Tom Moore and The Sun’s Who Cares Wins appeal — while big-hearted volunteers are working flat-out to sew together much-needed PPE and scrubs.And it is potentially fantastic news that human vaccine trials start in Oxford tomorrow, an amazing feat given that these processes normally take years.Those are all positives. But Mr Hancock should stop pretending his testing strategy is anything but a fiasco.Tests are going DOWN. He promised , a day by next Thursday. Why  It merely set him up for humiliation.Andwe can now carry out , a day, why are only , done Why are NHS staff forced to travel huge distances to a testing centre, only to be turned away  Why aren’t far, far more being testedthe capacity exists On PPE, why announce huge new stocks before they are in hand  Or sit for weeks on solid offers from UK suppliers On masks, why claim to be still evaluating the “science” on their effectiveness, when they are already vital in hospitals and care homes and routinely worn abroad The Government really just wants to prevent a public stampede when NHS staff need them more.This crisis is grim enough without people feeling misled by those they are trusting to see us through it.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I attacked the nearest from behind. I fired two bursts...I then saw the enemy aircraft fall out of formation and crash to the ground.I was then attacked from behind and forced down.After ing to Britain his second enemy kill came on June  when he shot down another Messerschmidt  over Abbeville, France.On July  over Dover he destroyed a Heinkel bomber which crashed in the sea with the loss of three of the crew.During the Battle of Britain Sq Ldr Hart was required to fly five sorties in a single day.He claimed a fourth kill - another Me  - on August  over Margate and then survived another crash landing at Foulness, Essex.On August  he gained ace status with a fth enemy plane destroyed followed by a sixth in November .He then joined No.  Squadron and served in the Middle East. He claimed three more kills while providing escort cover for RAF bombers ahead of the Allied advance on Tobruk in Libya.Sq Ldr Hart was awarded the DFC in February  for his great courage and skill in operational duties.Little is known of his RAF career for the following two years but he was posted to No.  Squadron in Italy in February .There he flew in another  sorties up until December when he was killed in action.

As I say, this baffling statement will make zero dference to their already fractured relationship with the UK.In an ideal world, every media outlet worldwide would form a pact that they will never again write about or use a photograph of the Sussexes.The effect would be swt and damning.For without the oxygen of publicity, what are they Married to a home-body, I have always rather envied those whose other halves travel frequently for their job.It gives you the house to yourself sporadicallyand makes you appreciate them when they .But in lockdown we are faring well because we are already used to being together most of the time.A friend whose husband usually travels for work called me the other day to say that his sudden, constant presence in the home was causing friction.And yesterday, Boyzone star Shane Lynch announced the sad news that lockdown has put his -year marriage to Sheena White under intolerable strain.He says: “I’m not even in my family home right now because me and her were at each other’s throats.“It wasn’t a good time or a good space.“I’m usually on the road and for the first time I’ve spent three months in my house . . . it can be a struggle.”Indeed it can. Let’s hope they sort it out for the sake of their two children.Now the dust has settled around Professor Neil Ferguson’s original estimate of , Covid deaths, it’s perhaps time to stand back and take a logical overview of the situation.While the death toll is still worrying, the mantra that we are critically harming the economy to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed is undermined by the news that many of the private hospitals repurposed for Covid patients are lying virtually empty and the ,-bed facility set up in London’s ExCel centre is only treating  people.It’s adding credence to the burgeoning mindset that, perhaps, those who are considered vulnerable should remain in lockdown while the rest of the country makes a gradualto school or work while maintaining strict social distancing measures.On GMB yesterday, a gruff, Swedish professor, whose name escaped me, was asked to explain the thinking behind his country’s policy to keep everything open.He replied: “People are not stupid.”In other words, the Swedes are taking personal responsibility for how they behave and, as of earlier this week, the death rate was starting to decline.It remains to be seen whether Sweden’s outlier stance proves to be the correct one, but one thing is for certain: Its economy may be weakened at the end of it, but it won’t be on the critical list like ours.Model and businessman David Gandy talked about the importance of fostering at the weekend, under the headline, “OMG. He’s so cute!”Indeed he is, was my immediate thought. My second was that I would happily foster him anytime.However, it turns out the headline and suggestion of benevolence was aimed at Dora, his rescue pup from Battersea Dogs Home, for which David is an ambassador.He says: “What I love about the evenings now is the calmness of a tired, sleeping dog at your side. I watch Dora dreaming.”Lucky Dora.One wondersshe knows that, when it comes to good fortune, she has won the canine equivalent of the Lottery.Last year, I read to kids in a primary school and, with rare exception, every time I asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, they replied: “A YouTuber.”Yet last week, while queuing behind a mother and her daughter outside the supermarket, the young girldeclared her desire to become a nurse when she left school.Now that is something positive to come out of the Covid- crisis.Jigsaws are getting me through the long days of lockdown.Despite The Bloke’s lame attempts to hide the last pieceI completed my fth at the weekend and, as an exercise in mindfulness, it’s right up there with any yoga retreat.So imagine my joy when Kodak announced last week that it has produced the world’s largest jigsaw with, gulp, , pieces.It is  separate images of world landmarks and, when finished, covers  square metres – about the size of a standard living room. Sadly, it also costs £, so I’ll stick to my ,-piece cheapies. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Spiegel, co-editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, said: In this study, Covid- patients with digestive symptoms have a worse clinical outcome and higher risk of mortality compared to those without digestive symptoms, emphasising the importance of including symptoms like diarrhoea to suspect Covid- early in the disease course before respiratory symptoms develop.Despite this revelation, people should still be vigilant in looking out for the primary symptoms of coronavirus including a dry cough and high temperature, as well as shortness of breath - as Covid- primarily attacks the lungs and respiratory system.Some patients may also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose or a sore throat - but these are usually mild and begin gradually.Developing these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have the illness and they are similar to other illnesses, such as the common cold or flu.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No checks have so far been set up to screen all travellers as they arrive at UK airports or harbours. Yet more than , people continue to fly or sail in each week – potentially bringing the deadly infection with them.Among them are thousands of British citizens being repatriated in the pandemic but not currently offered a test for the virus as they arrive in their homeland.Travel hubs in locations abroad – including Italy, Hong Kong and Japan – introduced temperature checks and other forms of screening weeks ago, with quarantine restrictions in place for new arrivals. Health chiefs have said that the measure would have a limited impactintroduced now – but admitted yesterday that testing remained an option for the future as the infection rate fell. No suggested the Government would be open to bringing in tests at ports of entrythe scientic advice supported it. Critics say the UK will not be able to tackle the crisis successfully without bringing in such a system. Shadow International Trade Minister Gareth Thomas told the Mirror: “It beggars belief that ministers are not insisting on tests at airports and other ports. “Such a move should be part of the national effort to reduce the spread of this terrible pandemic. “Places where it has been contained successfully, such as Hong Kong, have for weeks required everyone going through their ports and airports to be tested and thennecessary to isolate themselves.” Mr Thomas, whose West Harrow constituency in London is near Heathrow, went on: “Such a move would also help to protect staff and other passengers and crucially help to maintain confidence in Britain’s key trading routes.”The SNP ’s home affairs spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, said: “It is deeply concerning that the Home Secretary [Priti Patel] has failed to act and is still allowing thousands of people to enter the UK without having appropriate checks and measures in place. “Other countries in Europe and across the world have already introduced these measures, leaving the UK as an outlier. The British Government has been far too slow to act and must now step up in order to prevent an increased risk of transmission. “For people to have confidence in its approach, it is crucial that the Government puts in place these long-overdue measures and sets out how this will form part of a considered exit strategy.” Prof Jonathan Van Tam, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, suggested that port of entry screening for new arrivals into the UK could be introduced as the infection rate came down. He said a “basic problem” with such checks now was that they did not pick up cases of people who became infected overseas and only displayed symptoms once they were back in Britain.  At the same time, he said, the proportion of new cases coming in from abroad was currently “minuscule” compared with the “force of infection” still in the UK. He added: “We do at some point hope that we turn this curve down and that we then start to think carefully about easing some of the restrictions we are under, without letting this virus just chase off again. “That’s a really dficult balancing act and all scientic options will be under consideration at that point.” Downing Street suggested that it was open to changing its advicesuch a move was supported by the science.  The Prime Minister’s official spokes-man said: “We’ve always said that we’d be guided by the scientic and medical advice. If the case was to be made for changing our approach then we’d be prepared to do so.” A decision not to repatriate UK nationals stranded abroad as Covid- struck was made “consciously” by ministers, the UK’s top diplomat revealed. Sir Simon McDonald, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, said that rather than provide charter flights the Government initially chose to allow UK citizens,they were able, to make their own way home. He acknowledged that the decision meant it took some Britons longer to . But he called it “defensible”, adding: “Going commercial relieved the pressure on the British taxpayer.”  He told the Commons foreign affairs committee: “Other countries decided to move quickly to repatriations. “The Government decided consciously to rely on commercial means for as long as possible – and that people, their travel companies and their insurance need to be the first port of call. “Others may think that we were slow to move to charters but I think that was a good and sensible decision.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britain set hotter corfu 24c","story":"NewsUK weather: Britain hotter than Corfu this week as C heatwave hitsBrits are set to sizzle in C temperatures this week - far above the average April high of C - meaning the country is on course for its hottest April since ShareCommentsByRuki SayidConsumer Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video weather-met-office-predicts-sun-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news britain-set-hotter-corfu-c-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said there was #xCrelatively low confidence#xD that a shipment of , surgical gowns which had been due to arrive in the UK from Turkey on Sunday would make its way into the country on Monday.

Its chief executive, Niall Dickson, said: #xCIt would have been better had the Government not made the announcement in the first place#xD and said staff would need to make their own assessment over whether they felt safe with the PPE currently on offer. Mr Hopson told Radio #xs Today programme that it was wrong to focus on inidual consignments of PPE because #xCbitter experience over the last few weeks#xD has shown they cannot be relied upon, with some boxes containing the wrong items and thousands of pieces missing. #xCSo rather than being marched up to the top of the hill and being marched back down again, let#xs just focus on what we know we can be certain of,#xD he said. #xCLet#xs not focus on inidual consignments, let#xs try and get as quickly as possible to a sustainable supply of these gowns. #xCThere#xs no doubt that at the moment, we have now got trusts that have definitely got shortages of gowns.#xD Mr Hopson said trusts were reserving the stock of fluid-resistant gowns they do have for areas of high clinical risk, such as intensive care units, and using workarounds in other areas. #xCThere#xs one trust that#xs basically discovered thatyou launder those gowns at  degrees ... there#xs probably up to three times that you can do that, and the gowns appear to still be fully fluid-repellent,#xD he said.

The government has been criticised for allowing the Cheltenham Festival and the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League match to go ahead in the week beginning March . The English professional game took the decision to suspend competition on March  ahead of a round of matches that weekend, but that decision was made following positive tests for Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta and Cha forward Callum Hudson-Odoi, rather than following Government advice. The decision to suspend meant  matches due to be played in the Premier League and EFL that weekend did not take place, and Dr Rowland Kao from the University of Edinburgh says could have saved lives. Halting football could have been a lesaver, an expert said Asked whether there would have been a negative impact of those matches going ahead, Dr Kao told the PA news agency: #xCThere#xs a good chance, yes.

Terry Johnson called an ambulance for Derek Campbell after he could see the look of death on his palaposs face during a worrying Facetime call, the Liverpool Echo reports. The -year-old from Mann Island, Liverpool, was rushed to the Royal Liverpool Hospital, where he was treated for Covid- that left him in an induced coma for five days. During a three-week survival fight he was treated for acute pneumonia, an ear infection that caused sepsis and travelled to his kidney, and as his blood pressure dropped and with no response to antibiotics over a  period, his family feared the worst.Howevr, the drain clearance manageraposs health gradually got better, as he started squeezing medics hands to show he could respond to pain. Derek is now back home with his partner being nursed back to full health after beating the disease, which his loved ones, at one dark point, didnapost think was possible. His daughter Samantha recalled how she desperately watched and called her dad from , miles away in Darwin, Australia. Derek had self-isolated when he experienced symptoms including a bad cough and flu-like ailments, staying indoors for  days. Samantha, who works Down Under for Qantas airlines, explained how her dad grew gradually more sick alone in his apartment while she listened during constant phone calls as his condition worsened. But despite dismissing Samanthaaposs concerns, over a period of days, his health appeared to plummet, with his temperature rising, his taste and smell disappearing, and with hallucinations of men running around his city centre home. Derek, whose girlfriend lives in Manchester, telephoned  for medical advice, but was told to stay at home unless he was struggling to breathe. Samantha said she was shocked when her dad explained he hadnapost eaten for days and his apartment had turned into a horror movie. She told the Echo: He was very convincing, he told me his temperature had dropped and he was feeling much better and not to worry, whilst we were on the phone his partner arrived to drop a food parcel at the door, so we ended the conversation. I called him again the next morning, he seemed calm and again told me not to worry he was doing ok, he told me he had ate a sandwich. He wasn’t making much sense he kept confusing his words, it wasn’t like dad at all.  He told me it was the devil, he just felt weak. He complained about his ear and said water was pouring from it on to his pillow. I advised dad to get antibiotics sent to the house, I believe he was sent ear drops from a friend. I was extremely worried, as was his partner, but thankfully, my dadaposs best friend Terry Johnson was too, the guy who saved my dadaposs le. He had been in contact with my dad too had helped him with prescriptions and had watch him decline from afar. He decided after speaking to my dad over FaceTime enough was enough and called an ambulance as he said he could see the look of death take over his face. Dad remembers the ambulance turn up he said they where in full PPE - it was something he will never forget. He felt like he was in a zombie movie. He was taken to the Royal Hospital and was taken for scans. Soon after the doctor told my dad he was very sick and that he had to place him in to an induced coma he quickly asked to speak to my dadaposs next of kin. ...I sent a message to my dad telling him how proud I was and I loved him, he read that message as it was a Facebook message and then was placed in to a coma.It gave me some peace, but watching the hours turn in to days on his activity was painful. From then on, we were told he was in a pretty bad way. ...we where absolutely heartbroken, the first  hours where the worst. You can’t visit, calling is permitted to one person only, you just have to wait. After days of showing no improvement, Derek slowly started to respond. Samantha said: The feeling was euphoric, we had cried so much over the days. It was a pain I can’t explain. This was so dferent than anything, as you can’t do anything. Just before this had happened I got all my dadaposs friends and family to write positive things on his Facebook wall so he could wake up and read it.  As soon as we had his wall posted with love, he started to respond. Two days after, they decided he was doing that well they wanted to take him out of the coma. That was another win. The days went on, his eyes were open and they began to search for his phone, he was then taken out of intensive care. He couldnapost use his fingers for days, he was still on oxygen due to one of his lungs being badly affected still. It took him a few days to respond, each day was something dferent, first he was squeezing the nurses hands, next day he was nodding his head to respond to pain. In this time they told us he wouldn’t need dialysis for his kidney. It was like a miracle.

The shower - an annual event from April - - is to peak tonight, producing around  meteors per hour, and people have been sitting out in their gardens accompanied by duvets, hot chocolate and iPhones. At the same time, the billionaire Musk has launched a series of satellites aimed to providing a global internet service and between the two thereaposs been plenty to keep people watching the skies. Shona Moss, , said she and her partner got their six-year-old son out of bed at midnight and within  seconds the most amazing meteor Iaposve ever seen drew an arc across the sky. James Smith said: Man, the Lyrid meteor shower is spectacular and I’ve only been looking  minutes!!While Martina said: What a magical sky tonight! There are plenty of them!! But still waiting for that beautul, bright one, the most beautul Meteor like I saw last night shooting straight above my head! Oh please come on! Another Twitter user said: OMG ITaposS SO BEAUTIFUL. While Jamesh said at around .am: Just spotted an amazing meteor over Milton Keynes! Mesmerising. For some it was a less awe-inspiring experience and more tranquil.Phil Sloman said: Saw one meteor while watching the skies. Very peaceful experience with the sound of Tawny Owls in the nearby woods for accompaniment. Heading to bed now. The Lyrids are one of the oldest known meteor showers, having been observed for over , years.But with much of the world faced with uncertainty during coronavirus lockdown, it seems to have taken on more precedence this year - and people are appreciating the people around them as much whataposs going on in the sky.Brian Hill tweeted: Lovely hour in my back garden in Belfast with my we watching the meteor shower just under the starry plough. Many people pointed out that thanks to less air pollution, due to far fewer people heading out to work each day for the last month, the sky seemed clearer.Added to the meteors was the UFO-like lights also racing through the night sky, but these were not a natural phenomenon: rather a constellation of thousands of satellites designed to provide low-cost broadband internet service. The £ billion Starlink project has seen batches of satellites launched into the orbit  at a time, with a previous launch in late March and another tonight.They have been spotted all week in the UK due to their low Earth orbit, creating plenty of confusion on Twitter between Starlink and the meteor shower.One user with the handle @elliecov expressed her delight at spotting a aposmeteor showerapos, only to be left disappointed. First time I’ve ever seen a meteor shower and my inner child feels fulfilled that I finally got wish upon a shooting star, she tweeted.  However, later when she realised what sheaposd actually seen, she said: I’ve just found out the meteor shower was in fact Starlink satellites realigning and now I’m sad. But others were more impressed by both phenomenon and the chance to see them together. Twitter user Pamela said: Sitting in the garden with my sister with our duvets and a cup of hot chocolate watching the Starlink satellites and Lyrid meteor shower. Have seen   satellites so far in Glasgow, amazing. Love me some stargazing. While Scott Pottie wrote: Me and my  year old son watched them. He was so excited. Peter Laws added: Kids and I lay out in the garden for an hour under duvets and watched the #starlinksattelites. Saw them so clearly. While Han OaposConnor tweeted: Up early tomorrow but cheeky hour or so stargazing well spent. Great to see Starlink satellites, a beautul view of Venus and even lucky enough to see a meteor. The meteors come from leftover particles from Comet C  G Thatcher, and bits from broken asteroids. “When comets come around the sun, they leave a dusty trail behind them, NASA has explained. “Every year the Earth passes through these debris trails, which allows the bits to collide with our atmosphere where they disintegrate to create fiery and colourful streaks in the sky.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum newborn who survived coronavirus","story":"NewsMum of newborn who survived coronavirus couldnt face guilt of being testedTracy Maguires baby daughter Peyton is thought to be Scotlands youngest coronavirus patient after she tested positive at just three weeks old, at University Hospital WishawShareCommentsByLynn LoveAnna MacSwan:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video parent-introduce-britains-youngest-coronavirus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news mum-newborn-who-survived-coronavirus-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Prince of Wales said: “Beyond the walls of the hospitals, care homes, doctors’ surgeries and pharmacies, we have also seen a heart-warming burgeoning of remarkable kindness and concern for those in need across the country. “Younger people shopping for older folk, some making regular telephone calls to those living alone, Church services recorded and emailed to parishioners and, of course, we have seen the very best use of technology—allowing people to keep working, but also to keep in touch through virtual parties, games, singing—and some of the funniest videos I have seen for a long time!” The heir had been forced to self isolate for a week after contracting the Covid- disease but kept in regular touch with his family and pals through texting and video calls. Speaking in the latest edition of Country Le magazine, Charles, , said the crisis had made the country realise the vital importance of our farmers working night and day to keep Britain fed. He also paid tribute to the army of retailers, shop workers, delivery drivers and shelf stackers who have toiled to keep shops open amid the pandemic. Charles added: “What this national crisis has also brought home—dare I say it—is how much we rely on our agricultural community and all those in the food supply chain, from field to fork. “The retailers have been doing an outstanding job responding to the unprecedented pressures, and so has the entire supply chain.

It’s more important than ever Labour… hold the Government to account.” Hazard tape was on floors for social distancing as a handful of MPs ed to Westminster yesterday after Easter. Under proposals drawn up by the House authorities, MPs will be able to contribute to proceedings at Westminster - including questioning ministers - through video links. MPs will be urged to stay away from the chamberat all possible - with most taking part through online video conferencing. It is unclear how many will attend, with views ided among those who believe they have a duty to be present and others committed to staying away.  Speaker Lindsay Hoyle previously said: It will be a historic moment in our -year history to have MPs contributing to Prime Ministeraposs Questions, urgent questions and statements via video link from the safety of their own homes and offices. If it works, the House will consider extending the measures to a fully virtual Parliament as quickly as possible to include debates on motions and legislation and even a system of remote voting.” Experts from the National Cyber Security Centre have advised that the use of Zoom will be appropriate as long as the applicationaposs use is carefully managed.

Laboratories using the Public Health England test are advised to be careful before identying a patient as negative and to re-testthey are unsure. The document from the National Infection Serviceis revealed as the Government is way behind on its promise to test , people a day by the end of the month. Its re-testing advice appears to explain why, as of today, , daily tests were being carried out - but just , people were being tested. NHS labs are advised to continue using the PHE test until a better test is available. It comes after Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said recently said that “no test is better than a bad test”. Jon Ashworth, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, said: “Ministers boasted we were world leading in developing this test back in January. “If there have been concerns about its accuracy, senior figures have a duty to be clear and transparent with the public. “Given the Secretary of State has promised , tests a day by the end of the month we now need total clarity on what these tests are and who will be processing them.” The leaked document was reported by the OpenDemocracy website which cited a source claiming the test fails to detect up to % of positive COVID- results. The Department of Health and Social Care and Public Healt England both deny the failure rate is this high. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social care spokesperson said: “It is completely  to suggest PHE’s tests missed a quarter of positive cases.” “Our tests are extremely accurate and have been through rigorous quality control. They are as accurate as those provided through commercial partners.” Prof Sharon Peacock, PHE infection director, said: “No diagnostic test is % sensitive.  “Following a rigorous evaluation we learned the PCR test produced dferent results to alternative tests in less than % of samples and we issued immediate actions to laboratory staff to ensure the continued reliability of the test. “It is inaccurate to claim that the PHE diagnostic test provides  negative results % of the time. “It is standard practice to move to commercial test kits once available, and this work is already underway.” The UK has attempted to test key workers at drive through centres around the country. Many have been left empty with staff complaining of having to obtain strict prior permission to get a test. By contrast Germany has been testing , people a day for a month and is now stepping up contact tracing efforts. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, confirmed her government was to press ahead with plans to set up tracing teams of five people for every , citizens to track Covid- infection chains.

It comes as some Americans are protesting against lockdown despite the countryaposs death toll hitting over ,. Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Mr Patrick reiterated the much-criticised views he shared last month with the network.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   The grandfather, , said the lives of Texans were not as important as saving this country for us all. Mr Patrick went on to clary: I donapost want to die. Nobody wants to die. But man, weaposve got to take some risks and get back in the game and get this country back up and running.  On March , he had suggested he would rather die from the killer bug than let the economy crumble, while implying authorities had overreacted to the situation.  Mr Patrick went on to suggest that older people who are far more vulnerable to the disease, such as he is, can take care of themselves. Texas began re-opening some businesses on Monday, and in his latest interview the lieutenant governor said the decimation of the economy across the US corroborated the decision. When you start shutting down the economy and people start losing their paychecks and businesses canapost open and governments arenapost getting revenues... Iaposm sorry to say I was right on this, Mr Patrick said.  Iaposm thankful that we are now... finally beginning to open up Texas and other states because itaposs been long overdue. The lowering of the original projected death toll by the White House led Mr Patrick to conclude the government has been using the wrong science.  He said he has great respect for top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci - who has been advising the Trump administration, but he said America needed to face reality of where we are. In Texas, we have  million people.... and every le is valuable but  people out of  million, Mr Patrick continued. Weaposre locked down and weaposre crushing the average worker. Weaposre crushing small business. Weaposre crushing the markets. Weaposre crushing this country. The official infection rate in Texas stands at over , with  deaths.  Mr Patrick was speaking after the stateaposs Republican Governor Greg Abbott led the way in lting restrictions first. State parks have since re-opened, while certain shops can sell products as long as they are left outside to be collected by customers - while elective surgeries can resume. The governor has said any further decisions on re-opening further would be done in line with testing which he promised would go up quite a bit into next month. Following Texasapos lead, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina have all also partly lted restrictions to help the economy. Georgia intends to re-open gyms and hairdressers, for example. Dr Fauci and other experts continue to warn against re-opening states for business or risk another spike in virus cases. Speaking to NBC on Tuesday, ex Food and Drug Administration commissioner Margaret Hamburg said some states planning to re-open havenapost even met the presidentaposs minimum criteria for the lowest phase. Health officials have reiterated that widespread testing is crucial for allowing states to re-open, with Ms Hamburg claiming the country needs to between three and  times as much daily testing as weaposre doing.

This inept government is plunging incompetence to dangerous depths as companies claim they have no choice but to sell to the likes of Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland because offers to the UK were rejected. Add the astonishing revelation by the Foreign Office’s top civil servant that the Government lied and took a “political” ­decision to stay out of an EU scheme to mass-purchase kit and this scandal is damning. Ministers misleading people is wrong in principle and risks undermining widespread public consent for the lockdownmillions refuse to believe what they’re told. On PPE and testing, the Government has clearly failed, excuses no longer acceptable. Those responsible must be held to accountpeople are dying needlessly. Payback time OTHER insurance firms and suppliers charging for services we cannot use in the lockdown should follow the lead of Admiral, which is refunding £ to motorists. Some will understandably argue the repayment should to be much higher when many roads are virtually empty. But a money-back principle is established, which many firms will be under pressure to match or beat during an extraordinary period in our nation’s history. Deferring premiums from those struggling to pay is welcome too but those firms must also consider reducing and ing policy fees.

Although Bary is yet to be formally identied by authorities, Jean-Charles Brisard, a French international consultant and expert on terrorism appeared to confirm that Bary is one of the arrested suspects.He said: According to our information, it is Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, son of Adel Abdel Bari, involved in the attacks against the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in . It is not immediately clear how long Bary had been in Spain but it is understood he entered from north Africa. Bary, , left the UK in  to join the ranks of the so-called Islamic State in Syria as a foot soldier.In , a sickening image emerged on Twitter of him posing with a severed head.Underneath, the depraved Londoner wrote: “Chillin with my other homie, or whats left of him.” He added: “Its beautul whenever you see Allahs laws being implemented.” But by  it was reported that Bary, who had once been a budding rapper, was on the run after falling out with ISIS and may have hiding out in Turkey.At the time it was believed he was amongst  ‘disillusioned Westerners’ who had fled the murderous organisation. He managed to escape by disguising himself as a refugee and crossing the border during the chaos when ISIS retreated from Tal Abyad, reports suggest.He was brought up in Maida Vale, west London, and his father was believed to have had close connections with  Osama bin Laden.Bary is the son of Adel Abdul Bary - an Egyptian who recently admitted playing a role in the deadly bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.  Before he became radicalised he was an aspiring musician and his tracks were even played on BBC Radio . However once ISIS took hold he renounced his musical ambitions for Allah, he has previously said.

South Korean and Chinese officials and sources familiar with US intelligence have cast doubt on reports that Kim is gravely ill after a cardiovascular procedure, while the White House said it was closely monitoring the matter. Speculation about Kimaposs health first arose due to his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Koreaaposs founding father and Kimaposs grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April .

Regional government chiefs said today that they hope to re-open hotels in popular spots, including Tenere, to Spanish visitors in July and August. However, they are unlikely to receive foreign holidaymakers until the autumn. Speaking to the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, Canary Islands president Angel Victor Torres said the road back to recovery from the coronavirus pandemic would have to be gradual. That way, in October, November or December, which are good months in the Canary Islands, we can begin to receive tourists from other countries, he explained. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Tenere was at the centre of an international drama in February when the four-star H Costa Adeje Palace was one of the first places in Spain to go into lockdown, after an Italian guest tested positive for Covid-. Around  million Brit tourists visit Spain annually, making the country the UKaposs number one holiday destination.The Canary Islands were the first to have coronavirus in Spain and now we want to be the first out of confinement, Mr Torres continued. Juanma Moreno, president of the Andalucia region, says he is also optimistic that the Costa del Solaposs beaches could re-open this summer. However, he suggested that sunbathers might have to be monitored by police, with sections cordoned off to enable some social distancing. Hotels and restaurant owners have been proposing safety measures such as daily disinfection, micro-biological cleansing and taking peopleaposs temperatures, he added.  “It’s not what we’re used to but unfortunately while we haven’t got an effective treatment or a coronavirus vaccine, it’s something we’ll have to get used to, he said. Spain has been hit with the highest number of coronavirus cases in Europe with ,, a number which is second only to the US globally. It has suffered the worldaposs third highest death toll, with , lives lost. The country suffered a setback in its fight against the deadly bug today after a small rise in the number of deaths.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund.

Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country.

In an ideal world I’d like to see an even bigger league with Dundee given the chance to join United in the Premiership.Whether that can happen, we’ll have to wait and see.We’re right at the start of the process so I’m sure almost anything is still on the table.I hope all the clubs in this area get something out of reconstruction. What we get should be better for Scottish football.I just hope we can avoid the same sort of voting farce we had  days ago with the SPFL.Dundee and managing director John Nelms were left in an impossible position, evensome of the behaviour has been questionable.As far as I’m concerned we should move on now and look to a better future. Ideally one with United and the Dark Blues in the top flight together.I know the existing Premiership clubs would certainly want the Dee up, too.What we know for sure, having seen the goings-on for the past couple of weeks, is clubs will only vote for something that is in their own interest. That’s just the way the world is.The good news, I think, for Dundee in all that is having them catapulted into the top flight would be seen to have plenty of plus points for it.Just ask Aberdeen – having both our city clubs back in the top flight gives them more decent away crowds coming to Pittodrie and their fans good away days.They wouldn’t be the only ones that benefit from having the Dundee derby back in the Premiership.We need the biggest teams at the top table – make it happen!It’s a few days ago now but I want to offer my congratulations to Robbie Neilson and his team after Dundee United were crowned Championship winners.The Tangerines have been in pole position right from the first whistle and it’s more than deserved for all at Tannadice.We don’t know what the top flight might look like come next season but the main objective has been achieved by Robbie – get United back in the big time.That’s been the target for four years now.It’s taken far longer than anyone associated with the club would have liked but they’ve finally done it.With all the noise going on over the past couple of weeks over the season, just having their top spot confirmed must be a huge weight off their shoulders.With the way the world is, relief will be the main feeling I’d bet for Robbie, Tony Asghar and Mark Ogren.They’ve done their bit – now it’s about improving the team for a shot at what is likely to be a bigger Premiership next campaign.Well done United!Having only seen the info that’s come out in the press, I’ve found Dundee United’s fall-out with a supporters’ group strange.It sounds like the money the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation were looking to put into the club would be a benefit for everyone at Tannadice.There’s obviously been a disagreement behind the scenes but it doesn’t sit right with me having a go at your own fans – and on the day before the club were crowned champions, too.Jackie McNamara being up and about again was great to see last week. We were together in Scotland squads and he helped me a lot at that time. It’s fantastic to hear he’s on the mend again after a real health shock.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water.

He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears. You could use them.The hare stroked his ears.ldquoSo I do he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so the squirrel and hare ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, collecting as much water as possible.They both ed to the fire, and stood a safe distance away. The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-economy-braces-biggest-recession-300-years-due-lockdown---likely-recover","story":"While adjusting to le in isolation has been dficult, businesses have been hit particularly hard by the restrictions, with the budget watchdog now warning the country could suffer its biggest recession in  yearslockdown continues into the summer.The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the economy could shrink by  per cent this spring, with unemployment levels reaching . million over the coming months - its highest level since the s.The struggling economy has sparked comparisons to the financial crash in , and the Great Depression of the s, but experts are now predicting the outcome will be much worse.Experts now believe the UK is headed for its biggest economic slump since , when the country was hit by a deep freeze that spread across Europe.Temperatures plummeted on January , bringing with it the worst winter in  years and freezing over several countries, including France, England and Russia.The lsquoGreat Frostrsquo, as it came to be known, lasted for three months and sparked food shortages, thousands of deaths in France, and a huge deficit to the economy.The coronavirus pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record  per cent by June, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas warned.A drop this big would mark the largest decline ldquoin living memory, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR has said.However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak stressed that this forecast is just one possible scenario, and it merely suggests the scale of what the country is currently facing will have ldquoserious implications for our economy.He said: ldquoWe came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.ldquoOur planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.ldquoOur plan is the right plan.Mr Sunak assured that the government would not stand by and will act to support the economy, adding that the OBR expects the economic impact of the pandemic to be temporary.Despite being forecast for a signicant decline, the UK is expected toto its pre-coronavirus economic growth by the end of this year, with the OBR stating this amount will depend on how long the lockdown lasts.The OBR predicts that any drop in growth will be reversed in the three months to September, as the economy starts to recover.However, it warned that the pandemic may have a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise to . million by the end of June.Unemployment levels are currently . million, marking a rise from . per cent to  per cent.Unemployment rates are expected to remain high until , before dropping back to four per cent, according to the OBRrsquos forecast."},{"url":null,"title":"11-year-olds-thank-letter-delights-ambulance-staff","story":"Sarah Brady, , a primary seven pupil at Wallyford Primary School, was taking part in the first lsquoClap for our Carersrsquo event on March  with mum Samantha.She noticed the ambulance sitting at the end of her street so quickly drafted a letter and ran over with a rose and gave it to them.The letter read: ldquoThanks for everything yoursquore doing for the world, love Sarah Brady.Samantha said: ldquoThe clap was amazing.ldquoA few days later the ambulance had to come back to my house for my partner.ldquoThe ambulance lady said that two men were in Wallyford recently and someone gave them a letter and that they were really overwhelmed.

As Patrick Baker paddled his kayak past wobbling purple and white jellyfish and the occasional porpoise, battling to beat the temperamental currents, the deserted island of Belnahua took shape.Once ashore, he trekked over the beach and the overgrown grass to reach deserted terraced homes where dozens of slate quarry workers and their families once lived. Long since abandoned, the dilapidated walls and rusting machinery remain rooted, crumbling monuments to an almost forgotten age when Scottish island mined slate put a roof over the world.ldquoBelnahua was very ghostly, says Baker, an Edinburgh-based outdoor writer whose new book The Unremembered Placesexplores some of Scotlandrsquos wild, often overlooked locations and unravels the fascinating stories embedded in their past.ldquoIt was eerie and poignant and beautul, he continues. ldquoThe journey to Belnahua adds to its mystique. The island has that rare frozen-in-time quality to it.ldquoLots of the places I ended up visiting had that same feeling.Part travelogue and part social history, Baker has recorded his journeys to locations that have fallen off the beaten track: hidden caves, a quiet Highland reservoir with a deadly human toll linked to its construction, and secluded islands.Despite doing the footwork to become familiar with each before setting off, often these \"unremembered\" places still managed to capture Baker off-guard either by their enigmatic beauty or a tiny detail that shed new light on their seldom-told histories.At Belnahua, once at the epicentre of a mammoth slate industry which saw it and its neighbouring islands send Dalradian slate around the world, Baker picked his way through the \"ghost village\" with its abandoned homes, corroded machinery, rusted steam-driven crane and flooded quarries.Beyond the physical remains, he unravelled a much deeper story of island communities surrounded by turbulent waters which carried an astonishing number of vessels ndash a fair number of which would end up wrecked as they battled against the harsh, stormy Atlantic waters.ldquoThat brutality of the winter storms and their location on the edge of the Atlantic, would have made it an incredible place to live, says Baker. ldquoAt one point the water around Belnahua was one of the busiest watercourses around the UK, which is incredible to think of.A series of economic and natural calamities including a storm which Baker describes as being ldquoof epic proportions devastated the industry, leaving ft deep mines flooded by the swell of seawater which drenched their workings, and families with no work or reason to stay.Once home to more than  people at the slate industryrsquos peak at the end of the th century, by the s the island was empty.ldquoIt feels like it has been deserted, reflects Baker, whose book links the growth of the slate industry with bustling sea traffic and the rise of lighthouses to guide vessels on their way.ldquoIt was a rapid turnaround of being a very populated island with many people living on a tiny patch of land, to being completely deserted within a matter of weeks.ldquoIt has a feeling of rapid desertion to it. Itrsquos quite eerie but fascinating with machinery lying where it was left and no-one going to remove it.ldquoThe houses are there, he adds. ldquoBut what struck me was the row of deserted cottages which housed the slate miners and their families.ldquoIt banks to a small beach that is just footsteps from the front door to the water. I stood there and thought what an incredible place to live, but equally what a very hard and brutal place.ldquoItrsquos only really when you visit these places that you can transpose yourself into what it must have been like to live there and experience that.ldquoAnd Belnhua is very visceral and very real.While some \"unremembered\" spots are remote and challenging to reach, such as Blackwater Reservoir in Lochaber where he was taken aback by the small graveyard and the human cost of creating the dam, others are far closer to urban le.The Glen Loin Caves near Arrochar in West Dunbartonshire are the reputed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his army after the Battle of Methven in . However, Baker points out that much more recently they were a focal point for working-class sporting prowess.For two decades from the s, groups from the hard-working shipyards and poverty-stricken Glasgow tenements made the area their playground, taking up weekend residence in the caves from where they would climb the rocky walls of the \"Arrochar Alps\".The climbing clubs they formed would go on to lay the foundations for the sportrsquos modern standards, techniques and ethics.However, as years passed, the location of the caves they frequented became largely forgotten Bakerrsquos search for them resulting in a frustrating challenge over jagged rocks, through pines and across overgrown gashes in the hillside before finally stumbling into the dark, gaping entrance.ldquoSome of the places are pretty remote and hard to get to which may be a discouragement to people seeking to visit them, says Baker, as he explains the balance to be struck between drawing attention to secluded, forgotten spots and attracting people to visit.ldquoWe want to share the wonderment we are seeing and share these stories, he adds, ldquobut we donrsquot want to degrade the places or their mystery.Thatrsquos a particular issue for the \"wild\" islands he visits, dotted across Loch Awe and Loch Shiel, havens for wildle, some harbouring centuries-old graveyards or, in the case of Eilean Fhianain, once home to Irish missionary Saint Finnan and with its ruined chapel and burial grounds.Other islands revealed another side to their previously well-documented character.Baker explored Inchkeith Island, three miles north of Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth, aware of its prominence as a stop-off point for vessels between Fe and Edinburgh since the th century but surprised to discover its links to a bizarre attempt to invade the Port of Leith.ldquoI often had an idea about the story that was going to unravel in a particular place, and then found out other elements, says Baker, whose book covers eight destinations, each with its own character and signicance.ldquoIt was fascinating to find out about Inchkeithrsquos strategic importance and how, in , it was used as a sort of staging post for a fleet under the command of Scots-born John Paul Jones, who effectively founded the US Navy.A squadron of five ships had gathered at the mouth of the estuary near Dunbar, sparking panic in towns along the coast.Sailing under a commission for the Continental Navy for the American Colonies, John Paul Jones was known for attacking British naval and merchant ships and launching land offensives.His sights on this occasion, writes Baker, were set on Leith.Having penned a letter threatening to attack the port, his vessels took anchor at Inchkeith Island to await their next move.As luck had it, a fierce westerly gale put paid to Jonesrsquos plans. Having been prevented from reaching the port, Jones decided it was ldquoimpossible to pursue the enterprise with a good prospect of success.Baker, who has previously written about stories and landscape of the Cairngorms, says while the \"unremembered\" locations explored in his book may seem disparate, they share common links.ldquoScotlandrsquos wild histories ... speak of immeasurable social change, of the movement of people through time and landscape, he writes. ldquoYet they are often lost, overlooked or passed by.ldquoThey still have cultural relevance, but we donrsquot tend to give them enough signicance.

Very slowly beat in the caster sugar. I do this one teaspoon at a time to ensure the air stays in the mixture. When all the sugar has been added, mix the vanilla, vinegar and cornflour and then beat into the meringue. Rather than using a baking sheet lined with parchment I use a ceramic pie dishand oil very lightly. I serve the pavlova in this dish so it looks pretty and stops the chances of the meringue breaking. Fill the dish with thick scoops of the mixture to form the pavlova shape and bake in a preheated oven for  minutes then turn off the oven and leave for a further  minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile heat one punnet of raspberries with the icing sugar in a pan until the raspberries start to pop and the sugar has dissolved. Cook for about  or  minutes, stirring to ensure the mixture doesnt burn. Cool and then sieve the seeds to make a coulis and add the strawberries to the coulis.

This was the ideal  to do that.Interest in everything that Adelphi produces is usually huge, and new bottlings usually sell out very quickly, so it came as no surprise to me when Mackenzie told me that when the event was publicised, the tasting packs ndash five new expressions that will be tasted during Fridayrsquos session ndash sold out within  hours, with interest from as far afield as Australia and America.Mackenzie will be conducting the tasting, alongside Alex Bruce, managing director of Adelphi, and Arthur Motley, of Royal Mile Whiskies, which sells Adelphi whisky and has worked closely with them on Fridayrsquos event.But he is at pains to stress that the tasting is no exclusive event. ldquoA total of  people will have a tasting pack ndash however, this is not just for those people.

Our assumptions about what is lsquonormalrsquo in our daily lives have fundamentally changed. Many of our personal, family, community and organisational routines have been dramatically altered to help us get through this emergency.As we make this community effort, there is one old assumption which we must absolutely notto. This is the long-held and outdated thought that looking after the environment is in conflict with economic success.Scotland has already made strong progress in discarding this old mindset with a track record, for example, in reducing carbon emissions by creating the new industries of tomorrow such as renewable energy. Scotland, along with Iceland and New Zealand, established the Wellbeing Economy Governments Initiative in . It is these types of innovation that will help us createvibrant economies that will serve our human needs and are in sync with what our one and only earth can provide.Long-term visionAs Scotlandrsquos environmental watchdog, we have kept this long-term vision in mind as we work out how to play our own specic role in the national effort to tackle the current public health emergency.We have set our aim as making our ldquobest contribution to helping the nation get through this public health emergency in a way that protects and improves Scotlandrsquos environment.What does this mean for how we do our job  The Scottish Government has designated  critical national infrastructure sectors vital to the ing of society during this emergency. At SEPA,we regulate the environmental impact of many of these sectors. We are working closely with these sectors tohelp this national focus on food security, the provision of clean water and the maintenance of critical infrastructure and the support services on which we all rely.We know that all businesses we regulate are trying to operate in extraordinary circumstances. We know they are trying to look after the health of their own workforces. We know they may have supply-chain and other challenges.On th April, we published our regulatory philosophy for this next period, a new Coronavirus website, information and a series of lsquoregulatory positionsrsquo which support specic sectors over the period ahead. Wersquoll add more over the coming weeks.Do the right thingWe said thatwhereregulatedbusinesses are unable to fully meet their compliance obligations, they should prioritise conditions which directly protect the environment over those of an administrative nature. They should contact SEPA, work closely with us and document the choices and actions they take.WersquoveaskedScottish businesses to adapt responsibly and we expect the majority will. Ourmessagehas beenclear:you try to do the right thing in this next period, you will find a helpful and supportive regulator. If you deliberately do the wrong thing while the rest of Scottish society pulls together, yoursquoll get the uncompromising regulator your behaviour deserves.This approachof supporting progressive business behaviour and punishing poor business behaviourhas been central to our regulatory strategy: One Planet Prosperity. The challenge of how we help Scottish businesses and communities thrive within the resources that our one planet provides is more important now than ever.THATrsquoS THE SPIRIT: The North British Distillery, is among a group of drinks companies who are supplying high strength alcohol for hand sanitisers.InnovationIn the current period, wersquore alllooking at how companies are responding. Wersquore seeing the very best in innovation, as companies such as North British Distillery in Edinburgh are supplying high strength alcohol to produce hand sanitiser. International spirits firm Edrington, behind names like The Macallan, Highland Park, The Glenrothes and The Famous Grouseblended Scotch is supporting Glasgow City Councilrsquos production of sanitiser for care homes and front-line staff, such as waste and recycling workers, through ongoing donations of high strength alcohol from North British.Last week Edrington also donated hand sanitiser to The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre.Similar to most Scottish employers still able to operate, we have had to adapt in order to protect our workforce and help reduce the spread of the virus. We will continue to use a iety of means of checking and assessing compliance, including phone calls, issuing written advice, remotely managed technologies such as drones, targeted site and field visits, and other forms of intelligence gathering.Even some businesses which, unfortunately, have had to, or are considering, pausing production are already opening discussions with us about how they might reduce environmental impact when they restart their economic activity.People, planet and profitIn ,business sustainability leader John Elkingtoncoined the phrase thelsquotriple bottom linersquo of people, planet and profit. Despite it entering the business lexicon, twenty-five years later Elkington wrote an article in Hard Business Review announcing a lsquoproduct recallrsquo of his triple bottom line concept.The concept had become popular. It had helped bring environmental and social issues into boardroom deliberations. It sparked a series of actions by many businesses to improve their environmental performance and contribute to enhanced social outcomes.Elkington had hoped it would help fundamentally change our economies. It helped us step forward, but not jump ahead. It led to improvements, but not transformation. Elkington had that rare vision to call time on an idea that had been successful, but needed replacing by something new.Last year, Elkington and his team at Volans launched its lsquoTomorrowrsquos Capitalismrsquo inquiry. Alongside global companies such as Unilever, Aviva Investors, Covestro and The Body Shop, SEPA is participating as the only regulatory agency invited to join the project. We are bringing some of Scotlandrsquos innovation into the project and learning with others as we debate and, importantly, test practical ways of creating the future economy and society that will serve us all well.Last week, the Scottish Government announced an Economic Recovery Action Group. In doing so, the First Minster said ldquoits role will be to advise government on actions to support economic recovery. And crucially it will consider how these actions can contribute to our aim ofbuildinga fairer, and a greener, and a more equal society as well. SEPA will contribute our ideas from our One Planet Prosperity work with our partners in Scotland and from our participation in Volansrsquo Tomorrowrsquos Capitalism inquiry.As we take a moment to reflecton this th Earth Day,itrsquosclear that the next periodcanrsquot be an alibi for inaction. The future is not what it was going to be. As Scotlandrsquos environmental regulator, we will maintain our twin focus: regulating in a way that helps Scotland get through this public health emergency and regulating in a way that helps builds an even better, more inclusive and sustainable Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"matt-hancock-uk-agreed-take-part-eu-ppe-scheme-far-no-equipment-delivered","story":"Amid the continuing concerns over the availability of Personal Protective Equipment, the UK Health Secretary made his remarks after a Whitehall mandarin shocked MPs by saying the UK Governmentrsquos decision not to take part in anEU ventilator scheme was a ldquopolitical one.Sir Simon McDonald, the Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office, told a virtual session of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, that officials had briefed ministers on what continental procurment schemes were still open to the UK, even though it had left the European Union at the end of January.:FMQs as it happened: Nicola Sturgeon quizzed over Scotlands Covid- responseAsked why the UK was not involved in EU procurement, Sir Simon replied: \"We left the European Union on January .\"Pressed by Labour MP Chris Bryant, who argued the UK had \"every right\" to participate in the scheme, the chief official said: \"All I can say is, as a matter of fact, we have not taken part.\"When Tom Tugendhat, the committee Chairman, asked Sir Simon whether it had been a political decision by ministers, he replied: \"It was a political decision.\"British officials at the UK Mission to the EU in Brussels \"briefed ministers about what was available, what was on offer, and the decision is no,\" explained Sir Simon.However, last night in a dramatic twist, the Whitehall mandarin wrote to the committeeto say he had been \"incorrect\" and reverted to the Governments earlier defence that the EU scheme was not initially joined because of a \"communication problem\".Sir Simon saidhe wanted to \"clary\" that point which he had called \"incorrect\".He explained that \"due to a misunderstanding\" he had \"inadvertently and wrongly\" made the claim.\"Ministers were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken on whether or not to participate,\" he wrote.As the political row over the EU procurement scheme took off in the wake of Brexit, Downing Street last month claimed there had been a \"mix-up,\" which had meant emails from the EU about the procurement scheme were not received.Sir Simonrsquos initial remarks were seized upon by opposition politicians, whodemanded answers.Alyn Smith, the SNPrsquos foreign affairs spokesman, said the claim that the Conservative Governmentrsquos decision was a political decision rather than a logistical error was ldquodamning.:Couple die within a day of each other after contracting coronavirusThe Stirling MP declared: ldquoItrsquos clear UK Government ministers were briefed about the Europe-wide scheme but chose to reject vital protective equipment due to its narrow Brexit ideology.Sir Ed Davey, the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: \"This Governments evident unwillingness to work with the European Union through the current crisis is unforgivable.\"Time and again, the Government seem to have missed opportunities to join the EUs procurement efforts.

Itrsquos time for Westminster to wake up to the huge potential that these changes unleash and commit to reforming the Commons for good, she added.As a small number of MPs debated the motion the chamber had black and yellow taping on the floor and seats were marked with a no-entry sign or a tick to show where they could sit, ensuring they kept to the two-metre social distancing rule.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons Leader, told MPs said the new digital Parliament might not be perfect and technical glitches were likely to occur but he insisted: ldquoWe must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\"Mr Rees-Mogg explained that he expected to bring forward further motions shortly so MPs could extend the virtual ways of working for a longer period and to ldquomore substantive business including legislation.Karen Bradley, who chairs the Commons Procedure Committee, pointed out it had not looked thoroughly at remote voting, noting how ldquosome others have tried the trial run of it and cant say it was absolutely brilliant. A lot more work will need to be done\".Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle pointed out no decision had yet been taken with regards to voting and that any considerations to do so would be ldquocompletely checked\" before being implemented.In exchanges, Labourrsquos John Spellar said the Commons had to be the \"epicentre of the democratic system\" and its role scaled-up in the coming weeks to ensure questions are answered by ministers, noting: \"Otherwise, what is the point of Parliament \"Tory backbencher Sir Desmond Swayne, commenting on the limiting of numbers in the chamber, claimed it would be \"outrageous\"MPs were excluded from debates.\"This is the precedent that were now setting and it would be outrageousmembers elected to this House were unable to come and bring their concerns to this chamber because there were already a sufficient number of members within it,\" he said.Meanwhile, the House of Lords held its first-ever virtual sitting.Instead of a packed chamber for question time, peers took part remotely from their homes by internet link.The historic change led to less rowdy exchanges as members were called inidually by the Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, to speak rather than having to bob up and down in their seats in the House.Earlier in the Commons, Mr Rees-Mogg raised a smile among MPs when he joked: \"In , when the Black Death affected this country, Parliament couldnt sit and didnt the session was cancelled.ldquoThanks to modern technology, even I have moved on from  and Im glad to say that we can sit to carry out these fundamental constitutional s.

Its health service has been brought to its knees and the country remains under strict lockdown.So how can the Mafia thrive Rather than impinging their activities, lsquoLa Cosa Nostrarsquo - as the mob refers to itself - is defying lockdown and capitalising on the vulnerability of iniduals and businesses.In what ways Earlier this month, members held an elaborate funeral procession for a -year-old scion of one of Sicilys most renowned mob families, despite lockdown meaning funerals have been banned since early March. In the Sicilian district of Palermo, a local mob boss also organised a Good Friday church service, but it was ultimately halted by police.Making money Mafia clans are offering credit to firms on the brink, with anti-Mafia body, SOS Impresa, saying the virus has essentially transformed the mob into Italyrsquos largest bank, even buying shares in at-risk firms to offer apparent lsquolelinesrsquo that could soon be dead-weights.Targeting the vulnerable The Mafia provide necessities to poverty-stricken neighbourhoods - but these residents are then in the mobrsquos debt. Some debts are being repaid by those who find themselves newly unemployed agreeing to become foot-soldiers, boosting the Mafiarsquos numbers.Cleaning The mob has always invested in cleaning firms and delivery services and are now focusing on running funeral homes and hospital laundry services, two areas under severe pressure presently.Itrsquos always been this way On the island of Sicily, which was ruled by foreign invaders for centuries, islanders banded together to protect themselves and carry out their own brand of justice. In fact, the term rsquoMafioisorsquo - or lsquoMafia memberrsquo - originally had no criminal connotations, meaning only someone who was suspicious of authority.But by the mid-th century, the groups became private armies - lsquoMafiersquo - who extorted landowners and firms for protection money, evolving into the Sicilian Mafia as we know it today.The American mob A separate entity to the Sicilian Mafia, the US Mafia follows the same code of conduct, but is not faring so well. The cancellation of sporting events has wiped out millions of dollars in illegal gambling earnings, while other mafia mainstays, including extorting restaurants and construction rackets, have also ended, with eateries closed and building projects halted.Itrsquos just like the movies So many classic films feature the Mafia, from Francis Ford Coppolarsquos The Godfather, starring Marlon Brando, to Martin Scorsesersquos Goodfellas. But even Goodfellas was based in reality - inspired by the non-fiction book, Wiseguy, about mobster-turned-informant, Henry Hill.Tony Soprano The late James Gandolfini memorably played New Jersey mob boss Tony on iconic TV show, The Sopranos.

In the case of Covid-,one country is a pandemic hotspot, wersquore all at risk of reinfection.The ScotsmanScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard hoped the reconvening of the Scottish Parliament - obeying social distancing rules - would lsquousher in a new phase of heightened accountability and greater openness.rsquoHe said the national emergency was lsquoall the more reason for an intensication rather than a dilution of parliamentary scrutiny.rsquoldquoThat means members of the Scottish Parliament from all parties should have access to fully question Government ministers who are running the country during these most extraordinary of times, he said. ldquoEverywhere around there is mounting pressure to restart the economy. For me the choice is clear. Put simply, peoplersquos lives and well-being must be placed ahead of business considerations.He said those putting themselves most at risk during the pandemic - those working in care, for example, and stacking shelves supermarkets - are already those on lower wages, even zero hours contracts.ldquoSo the parliamentary scrutiny which we now need is about ensuring that the real-lived experiences of people have an influential bearing on the decisions made by both governments, he argued. ldquoIt is about ensuring that the maximum level of income support goes to those who need it. But it is also about the ethics of how we treat our elderly and infirm in the face of this pandemic. Everyone must have an equal right of access to treatment, dignity and respect and so the chance of le itself.The Stephen Pollard admitted there lsquowasnrsquot much to cheer about at the momentrsquo but, at a time when anyone over  is deemed especially vulnerable, he said, there was a lsquowonderful irony that the two people who have done most to bring us together are both in their s.rsquoldquoCaptain Tom Moore, the war veteran who captivated the nation over the weekend with his fund-raising walk for the NHS, is a scarcely believable , he said ldquoBut when it comes to the scarcely believable, nothing comes close to the fact that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is  today.Just over two weeks ago she spoke to the nation - and the world - about the pandemic.ldquoThere is no one  on the planet who could have talked as she did, with the history she has lived through and been part of, and with the respect she has earned from a le devoted to service and duty, he said. ldquoWe are so lucky to have her and all the more so at a time of national crisis."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-now-vital-government-goes-way","story":"The UK did not start its present lockdown until March . Up until then, the UK Government had given out very mixed messages. It allowed international sports fixtures to go ahead, allowing , fans from virus-hit Madrid to come to watch Liverpool play on March . It allowed racingrsquos Cheltenham Festival to go ahead from March -. It stopped contact tracing on March  with no apparent strategy to replace it.Between March  and , the hospital death rates were doubling every two-to three days. On March , Boris Johnson gave a speech which advised people to socially distance and not go to pubs and restaurants. Schools remained open. Although a section of the community took this advice, public transport was still very crowded, people were still going out, and on the following weekend, we saw thousands of people flocking to beauty spots across the country. Obviously the message that Mr Johnson had given was not understood and did not have the intended effect and transmission was still occurring to a great extent.Finally, on March , the present lockdown was announced. If this had been done a week previously, as in Germany, Austria and other places, our death and infection rates would be up to a quarter of those at present. With a doubling rate of three days, simple mathematics shows that in a week, the infections will quadruple. If the present lockdown had been announced a week earlier, a lot of our present problems would not be as great. There would be less need for PPE, intensive care beds and mortuaries. The lockdown would not be required as long as the virus would not have infected as much of the community. The economy would perhaps be less affected.A few weeks ago Professor Jason Leitch was talking about achieving herd immunity in an interview on BBC Scotland. Todayit has been reported that the WHO estimates only two to three per cent of the population is infected. It has also been suggested that having had Covid- does not guarantee immunity. This should hopefully stop any suggestion that we should allow successive waves of infection until we build up herd immunity.The Scottish Government needs to organise testing in the community and contact tracing so that we can ease the lockdown and keep the virus under control. The suggestion that this could start off in the more easily-isolated areas of the country seems a good idea. The Scottish Government should not be waiting for a ided, leaderless UK Government Cabinet to make a decision.Rob Evans, Dundee DD.IT is vital that the Scottish Government follows the advice from Neil Mackay. Health issues are devolved to the Scottish Government andNicola Sturgeon is unable to draw up regulations appropriate for the conditions which pertain in Scotland then that does call into question how Scotland could operate as an independent country. The Scottish Government must show that it is capable of governing the country in a distinct and appropriate manner.The regulations in all four home countries appear to have been cut and pasted from the same source. As an initial response that was quite acceptable, especiallythe source document has originally come from the World Health Organisation or the regulations imposed in another European country. However, now that the regulations have been in force for a month the four home countries need to develop their own regulations. The lower population density in Scotland presents both opportunities and challenges. The easy option is to follow Boris Johnson and then claim a big boy did it and ran away.Sandy Gemmill, Edinburgh EH.NEIL Mackay has deemed Boris Johnsonrsquos approach to the coronavirus pandemic as a ldquodisaster and has urged Nicola Sturgeon to ldquobreak away. Ms Sturgeon has been at pains to stay more or less aligned to the Westminster approach, so far, which is to her credit, but deviation can only be sensiblethe course ahead is definite.All politicians will make mistakes over this new and uncharted coronavirus outbreak, it is inevitable, and sadly lives are always subject to such political judgments. At this stage no one can be sure about most of the answers but what is terribly obvious is that this whole episode has exposed the fragilities of Scottish independence. Just look at the oil price situation for example, hence Ms Sturgeonrsquos desire not to be out on a limb for fear of it breaking, and rightly so. It will not please some nationalists but we are definitely better together at this point in time and our First Minister seems to be aware of this fact.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.IT is almost impossible to try to make sense of Neil Mackayrsquos article in a non-political perspective. First, no one can at this stage know what the result of the UK Government strategy will be. His criticism based on personalities is hardly factual. The main thrust of his argument that the Scottish Government should take a dferent approach is confusing, as there has been nothing to stop it doing so up to now presumably it believes the UKrsquos approach to be correct. Mr Mackay now needs to inform us in detail what detailed steps we should take in Scotland that are dferent.Colin McKay, Newton Stewart.THE UK Government has been on the receiving end of criticism from people and organisations across the political spectrum for its handling of some of the UK manestations of the Covid- pandemic.In particular, when the decision was announced in the last week or so in March, that the country would enter a period of lockdown which brought the economic le of the country to a juddering halt, there was comment that this action should have been taken seven,  or even more days earlier, and perhaps it should have. However, I wonderthe decision to postpone the onset of lockdown was made for very pragmatic reasons.Scroll back six or seven weeks or so, and we were being regaled on an almost daily basis in both print and broadcast media of y queues of people with trolleys waiting for supermarkets to open, and some time later, leaving these emporiums with trolleys stacked high with toilet rolls, kitchen paper, rice, pasta, part-baked bread rolls and other non-perishable goods, stripping the shelves bare in the process.Despite repeated pleas from civic, political and religious leaders, and the supermarket chains themselves, this activity continued for many days. I would imagine that, when introducing a new policy, particularly one which imposes considerable new restrictions, ministers and their advisors would consider what would be the likelihood of the target population co-operating with these new impositions, andimprobable, what scale of resources and expenditure would be required to compel and maintain their compliance.Given the response to the appeal for shoppers to revert to the pattern of purchasing that they had found perfectly adequate in the last week of January, the Government probably felt that it would have little chance of persuading the general population to accept much more drastic restrictions, at least until it had been persistently exposed to the carnage taking place in Italy and Spain. Even then, there were a signicant number of so-called Covidiots who seemed intent on defying any attempt to curb their liberty.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.THE language of war and battles to fight the coronavirus must stop.Language is a powerful tool. It can be used to both praise and demonise but either way it has an effect of on people, their wellbeing, their mental health. However, just as important as the adverse or positive effect that language can have on us as iniduals, words are also capable of shaping the public narrative to convince us what to think. Using war language to fight a health crisis is not helpful for at least three main reasons.The first is that it undermines legitimate challenge which, when it is absent, encourages systemic negligence to run rampantly unchecked.Secondly, it lulls us to uncritically accept the inevitability of thousands upon thousands of deaths, especially enabling the expendability of the costly, most vulnerable people in our society.Thirdly, war language demands sacrice and a culture of silence. This expectation is unnecessary, unwanted, and unhelpful it is anti-democratic and smacks of political expediency.All of these impacts are worrying and serves only as power and compliance tools for our political governors. Frontliners are workers, consistently undervalued ones, granted, but they are not warriors and they deserve the best protection. In light of this, more, many more questions need to be asked and answered.Why were we not prepared for this  Why are so many people dying compared to countries like Germany  Why are so many people dying in our care homes  Why are we demanding that our friends and family work on the frontline without full and proper protection for themselves and their patients  Why is there no urgency or recognition of the need to test and track Finally, in this modern Scotland, is it too much to ask to be treated like adults and receive honest answers in this bumbling, post-truth political world Councillor Brian McGinley , Ayr.I AM one of those people who go out every Thursday at pm to say thank you to all those dedicated people who are putting their lives and those of their families at risk to save others. I am, however, disappointed that the only references made regarding the Police Service are of issuing fines and heavy-handed tactics in dealing with the public in these dficult times.Their job is dficult enough and there is always a fine balance between discretion and enforcement.

The Good Morning Britain host was trashed for his criticism of Professor Jason Leitch, when the National Clinical Directorrefused to accept mass quarantining was the answer. ldquoListen to the expert! yelled Professor Leitch.Well, we did, and then we heard him say: ldquoWe have absolutely adequate levels of testing in Scotland. We heard his arguments for not testing: ldquoWersquore having to delay the spread of the virus. And, unbelievably, we heard him argue against social distancing: ldquoYou canrsquot keep m people six feet apart.We needed Morganrsquos questions at the time and we needed him again to kick hard at the shins of his Good Morning Britain colleague Dr Hilary after the telly doc backed the UK Governmentrsquos case for not yet closing the schools. Morgan raged again at the Government line, attacking Cabinet Minister Simon Clarke over \"shameful\" handling of PPE and him ldquonot having a clue how many health care staff had died. And during an interview with English culture secretary Oliver Dowden, Morganrsquos blood boiled at the insanity of allowing the Cheltenham Festival and the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid match to go ahead.But Morgan has shown added value this week on CNN, lambasting the morally bankrupt flibbertigibbet that is Boris Johnson and the asinine Donald Trump. . ldquoIrsquove been watching these daily briefings with mounting horror and, at almost every level, Donald Trump is failing the American people, with his self-aggrandising, self-justying rants.Morgan added: ldquoTo him, itrsquos more important he win the election in November.

Trumprsquos following, thankfully, has dropped six points.Now, Morgan isnrsquot clairvoyant and he certainly doesnrsquot always get the argument right.This week he attacked Dr Andrew Lilico, after the economist had criticised the NHS, leaping onto easy argument like John Wayne on a small horse, off to kill some Injuns. But Dr Lilicorsquos argument about \"NHS worship\" was certainly not a criticism of those brave enough to work for this underfunded service.But what Piers Morgan at least managed was to open the debate.

We know they are trying to look after the health of their own workforces.We know they may have supply-chain and other challenges.On April , we published our regulatory philosophy for this next period, a new Coronavirus website, information and a series of lsquoregulatory positionsrsquo which support specic sectors over the period ahead.Wersquoll add more over the coming weeks.Do the right thingWe said that where regulated businesses are unable to fully meet their compliance obligations, they should prioritise conditions which directly protect the environment over those of an administrative nature. They should contact SEPA, work closely with us and document the choices and actions they take.Wersquove asked Scottish businesses to adapt responsibly and we expect the majority will. Our message has been clear:you try to do the right thing in this next period, you will find a helpful and supportive regulator. If you deliberately do the wrong thing while the rest of Scottish society pulls together, yoursquoll get the uncompromising regulator your behaviour deserves.This approach of supporting progressive business behaviour and punishing poor business behaviour has been central to our regulatory strategy: One Planet Prosperity. The challenge of how we help Scottish businesses and communities thrive within the resources that our one planet provides is more important now than ever.InnovationIn the current period, wersquore all looking at how companies are responding. Wersquore seeing the very best in innovation, as companies such as North British Distillery in Edinburgh are supplying high strength alcohol to produce hand sanitiser.International spirits firm Edrington, behind names like The Macallan, Highland Park, The Glenrothes and The Famous Grouse blended Scotch is supporting Glasgow City Councilrsquos production of sanitiser for care homes and front-line staff, such as waste and recycling workers, through ongoing donations of high strength alcohol from North British. Last week Edrington also donated hand sanitiser to The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre.Similar to most Scottish employers still able to operate, we have had to adapt in order to protect our workforce and help reduce the spread of the virus. We will continue to use a iety of means of checking and assessing compliance, including phone calls, issuing written advice, remotely managed technologies such as drones, targeted site and field visits, and other forms of intelligence gathering.Even some businesses which, unfortunately, have had to, or are considering, pausing production are already opening discussions with us about how they might reduce environmental impact when they restart their economic activity.People, planet and profitIn , business sustainability leader John Elkington coined the phrase the lsquotriple bottom linersquo of people, planet and profit. Despite it entering the business lexicon,  years later Elkington wrote an article in Hard Business Review announcing a lsquoproduct recallrsquo of his triple bottom line concept.The concept had become popular. It had helped bring environmental and social issues into boardroom deliberations. It sparked a series of actions by many businesses to improve their environmental performance and contribute to enhanced social outcomes.Elkington had hoped it would help fundamentally change our economies. It helped us step forward, but not jump ahead. It led to improvements, but not transformation. Elkington had that rare vision to call time on an idea that had been successful, but needed replacing by something new.Last year, Elkington and his team at Volans launched its lsquoTomorrowrsquos Capitalismrsquo inquiry. Alongside global companies such as Unilever, Aviva Investors, Covestro and The Body Shop, SEPA is participating as the only regulatory agency invited to join the project.We are bringing some of Scotlandrsquos innovation into the project and learning with others as we debate and, importantly, test practical ways of creating the future economy and society that will serve us all well.Last week, the Scottish Government announced an Economic Recovery Action Group. In doing so, the First Minster said ldquoits role will be to advise government on actions to support economic recovery. And crucially it will consider how these actions can contribute to our aim of building a fairer, and a greener, and a more equal society as well.SEPA will contribute our ideas from our One Planet Prosperity work with our partners in Scotland and from our participation in Volansrsquo Tomorrowrsquos Capitalism inquiry.As we take a moment to reflect on this th Earth Day, itrsquos clear that the next period canrsquot be an alibi for inaction. The future is not what it was going to be.As Scotlandrsquos environmental regulator, we will maintain our twin focus: regulating in a way that helps Scotland get through this public health emergency and regulating in a way that helps builds an even better, more inclusive and sustainable Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"yousaf-says-given-up-leonard-scottish-labour-islamophobia","story":"The Justice Secretary said the Scottish Labour leader had ldquono credibility on the issuegiven at least one high-profile investigation had now dragged on more than two years.Mr Yousaf told BBC Radio Scotland: ldquoI have to say Irsquove given up even speaking to Richard Leonard on this matter.In March , Labour suspended Dumfries  Galloway councillor Jim Dempster after he made an Islamophobic comment about Mr Yousaf, who was then SNP transport minister.Cllr Dempster had referred to Mr Yousaf being invisible ldquounder his burka.Mr Leonard said at the time Cllr Dempster that had ldquounreservedly apologised for the hurt and offence caused, and there would be ldquoan inquiry and a due process will be followed.However, despite Cllr Dempster admitting the remark, Labour has still to conclude its inquiry.Asked about the case, Mr Yousaf told Good Morning Scotland he had no faith in Scottish Labour to act and urged new UK leader Sir Keir Starmer to settle the matter.He said: ldquoRichard Leonard has no credibility on this issue any more. I would urge Keir Starmer, the new leader of the Labour party in the UK, to process these complaints, to take decisive action, not just against Councillor Jim Dempster, but many others.He went on: ldquoIn terms of Richard Leonard,he thinks hersquos done enough and can now just pass over responsibility, and duck responsibility, then he should at the very least release all the correspondence that he sent to the UK Labour party on this issue demanding action is being action, so that we can actually judge the fact hersquos made an effort.ldquoI have to say Irsquove given up even speaking to Richard Leonard on this matter, or indeed raising it with the Scottish Labour party, because itrsquos clear to me that they donrsquot take these matters at all seriously.Earlier on the same show, Mr Leonard was asked about Mr Yousafrsquos previously saying he should be ashamed to show his face at anti-racism rallies given the Dempster case delay.Mr Leonard said: ldquoI am always happy to speak to Humza Yousaf about where we are with this case. I am frustrated as well that itrsquos taken as long as it has.ldquoItrsquos not clear to me why it has taken as long as it has.ldquoHe has been suspended and does not play an active part in the Labour party or the Labour group where hersquos an elected councillor.Pressed on a timetable for resolving the case, Mr Leonard said: ldquoIt needs to be resolved, in my view, timeously. Look, for the le of me I donrsquot know why it has taken as long as it has.ldquoIt ought to have been dealt with more speedily, but the consideration of that case rests in the hands of the party at a UK level.Mr Leonard then tried to change the focus of the interview back to coronavirus.He said: ldquoI have to say, some of these issues are a source of frustration to me, but in the end we are dealing with a national crisis where people are dying, and the effect of this pandemic ought to be the thing which is first and foremost in our discussions and debates.ldquoItrsquos whatrsquos driving me, itrsquos what Irsquom spending all my waking hours dealing with, not with some of the internal grievance and disciplinary procedures of the Labour party.Mr Leonard was also asked about readmitting nine Labour councillors who were suspended from the party in May  for working with the Tories on Aberdeen City Council.Mr Leonardrsquos new deputy, Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie, and the Shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray have both called for the lsquoAberdeen Ninersquo to be let back into the party.Asked why the matter had gone on for years and whether he was minded to readmit them, Mr Leonard again deferred to Labour in London: ldquoThe case of the Aberdeen councillors rests with the national constitutional committee of the Labour party.ldquoThere is a due process which needs to be followed and I am frustrated that it has taken as long as it has, but there is a due process which needs to be followed.ldquoTheir case is resting with the national constitutional committee of the Labour party.Askedthe committee was fit for purpose given the delay, Mr Leonard said: ldquoI am also frustrated it has taken as long as it has to get this resolved.ldquoWe understand that there is frustration faced by people in the Labour party in Aberdeen, members of that group in Aberdeen, but also this has wider implications too about how we go about our business as a party and itrsquos important that we give due process and donrsquot prejudice the hearings that will take place at some point in the future.In November, Mr Leonard admitted it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory the case had taken so long, but refused to get involved, saying it was a matter for Labourrsquos national constitutional committee.Askedhe ought to be involved, he said: ldquoNo, I donrsquot think I should be. I think itrsquos right therersquos a separation between the political leadership of the party and political representatives of the party and those people who are directly elected to carry out those investigations.It prompted Mr Yousaf at the time to accuse Mr Leonard of a ldquocomplete lack of leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : amOrbital Marine Power Ltd, the world’s leading developer of floating tidal stream turbines, has appointed Oliver Wragg as its commercial director.

Points will be awarded for such things as being able to speak English, having a job already lined up and meeting appropriate skill levels. They will also have to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the guidance informs is generally £,, although a lower salary might be accepted in some circumstances.Under this new system, low-skilled workers will not be able to receive visas to live and work in the UK.The new system however, will not apply to EU citizens already living in the UK by December , this year. They will be eligible to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.Highlighting the impact immigrants have had in the fight against coronavirus, Mr Carmichael called on the government to rethink its plans and support key workers.“When the immigration proposals were first announced earlier in the year I called them short-sighted and a risk to the long-term future of island communities,” he said.“We are already seeing the potential harm we risk to our communities and our country. It is time that the government started rethinking its plans.“Around the UK we are seeing the positive impact that immigrants are having as key workers in the fight against coronavirus. That the government has not reflected on this at all in developing its advice on immigration policy is disappointing. If immigrants can be essential workers in our country’s time of crisis, then they deserve our support to remain here afterwards.”Mr Carmichael added: “Last week I joined my colleague Christine Jardine in calling for foreign nationals working in the NHS in this crisis to have the right to remain. There can be no clearer case for their rights than the work they are doing right now.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK. Let#s allow them, women and man alike, to be fully welcomed as valued members of our communities, with equal status.Let#s make the changes needed to fully include them and their families and so appreciate the strength in ersity that is their much appreciated contribution to modern Shetland, modern Scotland and modern Britain.Peter#s choice of poetry is particularly relevant during a week when British farmers chartered planes to collect  farm workers from Romania.The manager of the airline says he has already put in a bid for the next six flights.These Romanians form the first link in a long chain that magically re-stocks our supermarket shelves while we lie sleeping in our beds every night.For those with an apatite for further contemplation, I would recommend the following article:Thanks for the helpful and interesting link Malcolm. It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle.

We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities.

In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in .

Prof Pennington said the Western Isles, which at the start of the week had only six confirmed cases of Covid-, could exit the restrictions as a “test-bed” before wider lockdowns were lted.Politicians said the idea was worth considering, but still carried risk.Prof Pennington said: #There could soon be a case for a geographical lting of restrictions # such as in some of the Scottish islands and the Highlands and Grampian.#The Western Isles and Orkney are the obvious candidates to be the test beds for an exit strategy for the country. Travel is restricted because they are islands and have extremely low levels of confirmed cases. You can control access to them and re-open things like shops and churches etc and get back gradually to normal le again.#As for people travelling to the islands it is to be remembered that the vast majority of people have not been affected.”He added that effective testing facilities, which would give a quick result, must first be in place to allow any restrictions to be eased.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan said that while the idea had merit, islanders would be alarmedthey felt their health was being compromised as part of an experiment.He said: #It is unfortunate that the language of ‘testbeds’ has been used by some to describe the Western Isles, which has disturbed a number of people who have contacted me about this subject.“We have a population that is more elderly and more vulnerable to this virus than most, and so slowing down the spread of the virus has to be our overriding priority.“Despite the fact we have a low number of confirmed cases, the true number of infected islanders is likely to be signicantly higher. There is certainly now a need for more testing locally.#We need to keep observing the social distancing guidelines and cannot allow any room for complacency.“Given that we may well be behind the infection curve for the rest of Scotland, there is a good case to be made for a regional approach to lting lockdown restrictions, when that happens. However, this also has to ensure that the islands are not subject to any influx of travellers from other areas where the virus has already peaked.”Highlands and Islands Conservative MSP Donald Cameron added: “Any proposal to trial a relaxation of the lockdown rules must have the full support of local residents with the protection of the most vulnerable remaining paramount, as well as ensuring the NHS is not put under any unnecessary strain.“However, the geography of the islands means they are suitable for a possible trial and Professor Pennington’s suggestions certainly deserve serious consideration.“Given the fragile nature of the islands# local economy at this time, we need to give our communities every chance of not only getting through this pandemic but also kick-starting a recovery as quickly as possible. This proposal may well help in that endeavour.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/grimsay.jpg","title":"grimsay boat haven virtual launch replaces scheduled weekend of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA video has been made to launch the new boat haven in Grimsay after lockdown procedures forced original plans to change.Grimsay Community Association had originally planned a two-day extravaganza of events and activities over the Easter weekend to celebrate the launch of the new Grimsay boat haven.Unfortunately, current travel restrictions and social distancing meant that this could not go ahead.Organisers say that as soon as it is allowed and practicable they will be organising a celebratory event at the new haven. includes a virtual tour of the boats that are on display.

The project came about when Village Blinds was forced to close temporarily due to the ongoing COVID- pandemic.“Although we had taken the decision to close temporarily, we wanted to do something to help in providing a product or service for our incredible NHS staff and care workers,” explained Harold. “With the urgent need for scrubs so highly documented, we knew this was something practical that we could help with.”With many fabric manufacturers also closed temporarily, Harold struggled to source a bulk fabric initially, until he spoke to Kevin Devlin, managing director of fabric manufacturer William Clark and Sons in Upperlands, Maghera.“Kevin kindly agreed to bring back some of his staff to produce the fabric we neededwe placed a minimum order of , metres,” continued Harold. “A friend immediately launched a fundraising campaign to raise the five-figure sum required to buy the fabric and, within days, we exceeded our target thanks to the kindness and generosity of hundreds of people.”“We had then started to cut and distribute the fabrics within our own factory to enable our stitcher volunteers to get to work. With the demand being so pressing, however, we had to switch to auto machine cutting of the scrubs, working with Bradfor’s from Rostrevor, who kindly offered their services free of charge. This allowed the , metres of fabric to be cut into pieces ready for stitching.”Harold and Alison distributed the fabric to what they described as “an exceptional band of stitchers”, made up of over  volunteers spread right across Mid and East Antrim – including Ballymena, Broughshane, Cullybackey, Cloughmills, Ahoghill and Larne. Groups involved included ‘Bannside Stitchers’, ‘Cloughmills Crochet Club’ and ‘Tullygarley Sewing Group’.“We are deeply indebted to each and every person involved either with the groups or as iniduals for their help and expertise,” said Harold. “Many of these amazing women are well over the age of  themselves and have been in isolation for weeks. With many of them professional stitchers from days gone by, the speed at which they have been able to work is outstanding and the workmanship and quality coming back from them is absolutely impeccable.“This project has had a hugely positive impact on them in one way or another. As well as being physically unwell, many of them were feeling very down and isolated by the ongoing lockdown. The opportunity to use their talent and skill in this way has really brought new le to them.”Harold and Alison have been operating a drop off and pick up service, distributing fabric to stitchers across the borough and picking up dozens of pairs of completed scrubs just days later.Over , pairs of scrubs are now in the process of being distributed, with some having gone already to Antrim and Causeway Hospitals and a number of nursing homes in Mid and East Antrim, as well as in Lisburn and Belfast.A collective statement from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Group Party Leaders – Councillors Gregg McKeen, Timothy Gaston, Keith Turner, Gerardine Mulvenna, Eugene Reid and James McKeown – praised Harold and Alison and their group of volunteers for their efforts.“In recent weeks we have seen many fantastic examples of businesses in Mid and East Antrim being proactive and really going out to their way to do anything they can to help in the fight against COVID-.“Harold and Alison McCloy, their ‘band of stitchers’ and all those who helped with this project in any way, are to be commended for this remarkable display of thoughtfulness, selflessness and generosity. Exemplying the outward-looking values that characterise the people of Mid and East Antrim, their kindness will be felt by hundreds of frontline NHS and care workers at a time of great need.”Harold and Alison are continuing to raise funds throughout the campaign, with new project being planned to help the NHS and local charities.

Even though we are restricted in where we can go in our everyday le right now, in our imagination we are free to go wherever we like.

I personally do not feel that my email was incompatible with the same.I did not direct any of my comments at the recipient of the email personally and I have offered a very public apology for the unprofessional language used within the email.However, DUP councillor Darryn Causby said the comments were deeply inappropriate and Mr Keating should refer himself to the commissioner.It is right an apology has been issued, even though it appears only to have been issued after he inadvertently sent the email to all councillors and had been caught being incredibly rude and unprofessional, he said.As a former Lord Mayor he should know better. Councillors may have deep feelings about these matters, but we must always keep our discourse civilised and professional.Current Lord Mayor Mealla Campbell also moved to distance the council from the remarks.The views expressed are those of an inidual councillor and not the council, she said.The language and tone used in the email is not representative of the way in which the council carries out its business.It is my understanding that Cllr Keating has formally apologised for his conduct.Belfast Most ReadVideo: Last footage of Alex Higgins shows cupboards stacked with food...but he couldn’t eat a biteDUP#s Donaldson reveals pain of being unable to visit father #fighting final battle#Sinn Fein councillor apologises for ‘stay the f*** at home’ email to constituentMichelle O’Neill challenges Jim Allister to repeat ‘misled’ allegation outside AssemblyTributes after death of noted Irish historian Jonathan Bardon,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since the introduction of testing on th March  and up to th April  a total of  Northern Sector staff have been tested – this covers both hospital and community staff.” Approximately , people responded to a workforce appeal by the Trust to allow it to cope with an increased demand on services in light of the coronavirus pandemic. That included retired doctors and student nurses who have joined the frontline. A quarter of those applicants have commenced work in a range of roles. A spokesperson explained. “The Trust recently launched a workforce appeal for staff and have appointed  staff to date. “The recruitment team is continuing to process a large number of applications.” Northern Ireland is nearing the end of what was described as the first wave of cases which was expected to peak between April -. Under this ‘reasonable worst case scenario’, the projected number of cumulative COVID- deaths in Northern Ireland over  weeks of the epidemic would be ,. The latest Public Health Agencybulletin, as of April , reports  deaths. It is believed that this peak may be less severe than first anticipated but last Thursday saw the highest daily rise with  COVID related deaths in NI hospitals. That total was matched on Friday and a further  people tested positive, a development Health Minister Robin Swann described was a ‘wake up call’ as he warned against complacency. On Saturday a further  deaths were registered and one more person was added to the overall death toll on Sunday. TESTING Almost , people have been tested for COVID- in Northern Ireland - over , of them health care workers. The current target is set at over , tests per day with a view to scaling up over time and expanding priority groups. The test centre at City of Derry Rugby Club will assist with that upscaling. Criticism has been levelled at the government for limited testing in the community and contact tracing as that will be crucial when it comes to estimating population immunity and designing an exit strategy to move out of the current lockdown. Speaking last week Minister of Health Robin Swann said: “Testing of health care workers has been a key priority of mine and I am glad that in recent weeks we have tested over , of our frontline staff. “That’s important for them, and it’s also important for the people they support such as the residents in our care homes.” He continued: ”An expert working group has also been established to lead on the expansion of testing across all our laboratory services, both within Health and Social Care facilities, and also to consider options for the utilisation of other testing facilities including within the commercial sector. “There is a NI Testing Strategy that has already been shared with the Executive and the Health Committee. In that I have made it clear that the overall testing policy will be adjusted over time as testing capacity increases, and priority groups for testing are expanded. “Similarly the strategy also includes a pledge that testing will soon move towards surveillance of COVID- in the population to inform planning of services including surge capacity, and to estimate population immunity.“  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dorothy Hamilton lives in Cookstown and receives support from the Mid Ulster Age Sector network set up by Age NI, who have an office in Magherafelt. “I feel like a prisoner in my own house, to tell you the truth,” said the -year-old. “I used to take the car to Tesco, and I looked forward to going to get groceries and all, but that’s out of the question now. It’s like being in the army, I believe, in Tesco now, it’s hard work. googletag.cmd.push The loneliness of the lockdown was brought into sharp focus for Dorothy last week when she celebrated her thbirthday at home. She said: “I had my birthday on Monday, and I was here on my own. I suppose people wanted to come round but they couldn’t come in. “It’s awful having to spend your birthday on your own with no visitors at all. It’s been three weeks or a month since I’ve been out, I’m fed up on my own in the house. “It’s a quiet place to live, but I didn’t realise it could be as quiet as it is now. All my friends have moved out to where. It’s dficult at times.” googletag.cmd.push When the lockdown was first announced, Dorothy did her best to make the most of the free time, but as time went on, it became more dficult. She said: “It’s been three weeks or a month since I’ve been out, I’m fed up on my own in the house. I try to keep dressed reasonably well asI’m going out somewhere. “I was grand at the start for ten days or so. I sat one day sewing and was quite content and it passed the afternoon for me, but you can only pass the time for so long and the rest of the time you don’t know what to do with yourself.” “With things the way they are, I must start and exercise, but I’m very sore. I sat one day sewing and was quite content and it passed the afternoon for me.” The former health service worker says the support she is getting from Mid Ulster Age Sector network, and in particular Linda and Raymond McGarvey, has been a real help. Dorothy says Linda is very strict, but she understands the need for the stringent measures and is aware of the danger the virus can pose. “Linda comes down and she’s really strict – she has gloves and the lot,” she said. “I’m looking forward to this ban being lted but old people are dying in the homes like flies. The economy is terrible. I would hate to have a small business because I’d have to close. “I miss getting out in the car most of all. I don’t drive all that far but I miss getting out down the road. That’s all gone. “I also used to walk for miles butyou went out on your own here now, they’d think you weren’t wise!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The call comes after the district’s Gross Value Addedwas predicted to drop by % as a result of the Covid- pandemic. GVA measures the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or economy and, according to a recent Centre for Progressive Policy report, Mid Ulster will suffer the highest rate of decline in Northern Ireland. The report, which presents the likely economic contraction as a result of Covid-, ranks the council area as having the th highest rate of GVA decline of the UK’s  council areas. googletag.cmd.push Council chairperson Martin Kearney described the report’s findings as ‘stark’. “The signicance of regional iations across the UK cannot be ignored,” he said. “This report underlines the very real need for a bespoke intervention by the Department for the Economy and Invest NI, to bring a package of immediate, substantial and sustained support for Mid Ulsterour economy is not to be shredded by the impact of the pandemic. “We are already engaging with businesses across Mid Ulster, from manufacturing to retail, to ensure there is a very clear understanding of what the impact is, which will allow us to demonstrate what support is needed and where it should be targeted.” googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster’s position as the centre of manufacturing and engineering is thought to be behind the extent of the predicted decline. The sector accounts for % of the local economy, compared with an average of % for the rest of Northern Ireland.

The call comes after the district’s Gross Value Addedwas predicted to drop by % as a result of the Covid- pandemic. GVA measures the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or economy and, according to a recent Centre for Progressive Policy report, Mid Ulster will suffer the highest rate of decline in Northern Ireland.

The sector accounts for % of the local economy, compared with an average of % for the rest of Northern Ireland.

It can take us out of the situation we are in that, for some people, is really challenging.” Although nostalgia is widely regarded as a positive emotion, this was not always the case and early research into the area deemed it to be a psychological problem. The term was coined by Swiss doctor Johannes Hoffer in , who deemed it a ‘neurological disease of essentially demonic cause’ after studying Swiss mercenaries stationed abroad. It arose from the Greek terms nostos – meaning a yearning tohome – and algos – its associated pain. Hoffer also concluded that the condition may have been caused by incessant cowbells in the Alps causing damage to the soldiers’ ears and brain cells. Even throughout the th and th centuries, it carried the stigma of ‘immigrant psychosis’, a form of ‘melancholia’ and a ‘mentally regressive compulsive disorder’. Sarah describes the concept as ‘bittersweet’ and refers to it as a ‘double-edged sword’. “Because it triggered dissatisfaction and lots of negative emotions like stress, fear and loss, it was interpreted as something you don’t want to have,” she says. “It really is bittersweet. It’s sweet because we’re remembering the good times, all the things that were good in the past, but it’s bitter because we know we can never regain that experience. “It’s gone forever. Time is irreversible and there’s something really sad about that. “The song ‘Days of Our Lives’ by Queen has the lines: ‘Can’t turn back the clock, can’t turn back time, ain’t that a shame’ and I think that really summarises it well. “Although it’s a lovely thing to think back, we can’t turn back the time. It’s really positive in one way but there’s a downside to it as well.” Nostalgia is often triggered by activities that people enjoy, such as music or sport, and Sarah says this is especially the case during a time of psychological distancing. “It can really help counteract feelings of loneliness,” she said. “It’s a huge link because those [music and sport] are things we love. If we think back to times when you played a good match, or went to an enjoyable concert, those are happy memories. “Nostalgic thoughts unite us with people again in our minds. It increases the perception of social support and reminds us of a time when we were with people, doing things and enjoying them.” A rise in nostalgia can often be a result of coming face-to-face with your own mortality and as the death toll in Northern Ireland reaches , people are increasingly worried. “It’s giving them that sense that you actually can die,” says Sarah. “Some people are quite concerned about it, but others probably still feel an element of ‘that’s not going to happen to me’. “One thing many are most concerned about is the economic effect that it’s having. They’re concerned about job loss – a lot of people have been furloughed. “They’ll be wonderingtheir job will continue after this period and what will happen in terms of paying bills and mortgages. The fear that we are going to go into recession is causing worries. Through talking to clients, Sarah has heard many people talk about the unexpected positive aspects that have arisen from the effects of the lockdown. She says: “I am hearing a lot of people really focusing on the positives, which is great. They are loving having more precious time to spend with their families and their children. “Little things like the slower pace of le – you can hear the birds singing more in the mornings. It’s giving time for people to reflect and re-evaluate their lives. Although the psychological distancing that we are currently having to enforce increases feelings of isolation and loneliness, people are adapting. Sarah says: “People are finding ways of coping with it by trying to find a bit of regularity in their lives - doing things like exercise every day and keeping some kind of structure to their day. “We’ve gone from being able to do whatever we want to having massive restrictions on us. “None of us like being told what to do or being held back from living our lives how we want to live them. “We’re having to draw on our willpower to focus and do the things that are right for ourselves and for everyone.” If nostalgia can act as a buffer against the fear and frustration caused by Covid-, then open that GAA archive, put on the old TV re-runs and wallow in reminiscent therapy.

Judes story is all the more remarkable given that his book Why Does Daddy Always Look So Sad was first self published just last May.By October his searingly honest account of being autistic and being a father had been snapped up by Beyond Words the same American company that published worldwide best selling self help book The Secret.Judesays he wrote thebookfor his son Ethan, now , to show autstic peoples livescan be every bit as happy and fulfilled as those not on the spectrum. The title of the book came from a question Ethan, who is not autistic, askedJudesmum when he was just three.Judestarted writing the book to record his childhood and journey into fatherhood, after realising that most of the books on autism focused on children, not parents. googletag.cmd.push It was a bit of a bucket list thing, to have a book published before I was , he says.  I wanted to make a record of my early le and Ethans early le.Im proudly autistic now but that wasnt always the case.I used to try and hide it.After sending it off to a string of literary agents with no successJudepublished it himself and it went on to earn a stringof five star reviews on Amazon and attractedthe attention of one of the worlds leading consultants on autism, Maisie Soetantyo.Why Does Daddy Always Look so Sad  also caught the eye of an American literary agent who took it to Beyond Words Publishing.Impressed byJudes warts and all story which detailed his childhood struggles, through to adaptingto becoming a parent they agreed to launch the book in the US with a speaking tour.Beyond Words Publishing get submissions from all over the world but they only publish about  books a year so for them to publish my book is just unbelievable, saysJude. googletag.cmd.push I never in my widest dreams thought this was going to happen.The publishers said the book resonates with people because its not about swimming the channel or climbing Everest, Im just a normal, relatable person.Im remarkably unremarkable but they thought it was important to get my story out there.For the past eight monthsJudehas been working closely with his publisher to plan the promotion of his book.They are eight hours behind me, so I wouldbe finishing work atpm and they would just be starting, he explains.But with the outbreak of the coronavirus all the carefully laid plans have had to be scrapped.Its in the lap of the gods, but I just dont want it to vanish without a trace, says Jude.I want to out it in frontof as many people as possible. Growing up dferentJude, who grew up in the Bogside before moving to the Waterside, says he knew from a young age that he was dferent.I have never felt not dferent, he says.ObviouslyI have always been autistic, and I always would have been aware too that other children would be out playing games or playing in the street and I spent most of my time alone.Juderecalls spending hours lining up his toy cars on the window sill of his childhood home in Gartan Square.By a stroke of luck the flat recently came up for sale and Locate Estate Agents agreed to let him come and have a look around.That was magic, saysJude.The atmosphere was still the same.I could just imagine my mammy and my daddy there and my wee sister Emily tottering aboutI rang up Locate because Im a chancer and said Ive written this book and its out all over the world and a lot of happened there.Growing up Jude went to the Model School Derry, Oakgrove and St Columbs College.I had a lot of help and support and at the time I was resentful of it, but I look back more fondlyat it now, he saysThere were no autism support groups in the city at that time, so when Jude was a teenager he joined cross community youth group Reach Across.His lazer focus and love of order were put to good use helping to organise activities and grant applications and at  he was invited back to the group as a leader.This led him on to a Social Work degree at Ulster University, Magee.The boy who has social dficulty ended up being a social worker, he smiles. Becoming a dadJudesaid he used to perceive autism as something that he had grown out of.He had a successful job as a social worker and was able to navigate le well. But becomingadad at the age of  threw his carefullyordered world into disarray.Instead of cherishing and celebrating this wee baby I was more preoccupied with wheres my sense of control , he admits.When Ethan was three he asked his granny the heart wrenching question why does daddy always look so sad , which was to become the title of the book.He was able to pick up that I wasnt happy or that I found things dficult, Jude explains.And he still knows when Im not happy.Hes  now and he knows that I like things done a certain way.I have a lot of buttons and he has lots of wee fingers to press them with, he laughs.So was Ethans question the catalyst that turned Jude into the perfect father No, that would be far too easy, he sighs.It wasnt a lightbulb moment.Embracing being autistic and fatherhood was a gradual process that has continued after the publication of the book.I had to give in and accept I was autistic.I would have said i have autism but I have become more educated and listened to autism voices and they would say they are autstic, not that they have autism.Its not a handbag or an accessory that you have.Its an intrinsic piece of someone.I used to think in my own head I have a condition, but its the way I am.Its not something fatal or that needs treatment.Judes view of autism has come full circle and he now regards it as a blessing.To me its an advantage and to a lot of autistic people its an advantage.Autistic people are the most passionate and driven iniduals.If it wasnt for autstic people there would be no fire, no wheel, no electricity, no music, no arts, nothing!   Reaching outSince publishing the book last yearJudehas given a series of talks and book signings which have given the -year-old social worker the chance to reach out to autistic children.I love meeting autistic kids.They are like me and I am like them.Im not in the business of giving parenting advice and when I give a talk to parents its always the kids who ask the questions.Theres a misconception that autistic kids dont know they are dferent.I want to tell them that things will be grand.He has also been contacted by people from around the world who have been touched by his story and he has encouraged anyone with questions to get in touch with him online.I reach out to people all the time and I have a black belt in responding, saysJude.Why Does Daddy Always Look so Sad  is available on Amazon in both paperback and ebook.For more information seewww.judemorrowor theJudeMorrowAuthor page on Facebook.

It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

The cast, led by the remarkable Teresa O’Kane, produced their own version of the Black and White Minstrels Show, whose national production would later cause widespread controversy. Teresa’s son Joseph O’Kane was involved in the show and admits that the production would certainly not have happened in the current era. “It wouldn’t be too politically correct now,” he told the County Derry Post. “She had to get black and white dye out of some theatrical place in Belfast. Everybody was blackened up with white eyes. You couldn’t get the stuff off you for about two days afterwards!” googletag.cmd.push The show began le as a light entertainment show and ran for around  years on BBC prime time television, where it was hugely popular. A spin-off stage show also played for a decade at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London, before going on tour to Australia and New Zealand. It courted controversy, however, when it was accused of racism and ethnic stereotyping by anti-racist groups in the UK due its use of the theatrical make-up known as ‘blackface’. From the boardwalks of London, the local production in rural south Derry proved a hit from the moment it debuted at St Patrick’s Hall in Castledawson on October , . googletag.cmd.push  The hall itself was built in  after local businessman Patrick Convery donated land on New Row and was used by both parish and club until it was rebuilt as St Patrick’s Church in . “They went round all the local clubs – Glen, Slaughtneil, Swatragh, Kilrea, Bellaghy and Lavey and the rest,” recalls Joseph. “It was really good. They had a chorus of these black and white minstrels and girls and then they had a few solo artists and other groups.” Joseph remembers Frank Toner standing out as the star, closing the show with a stirring rendition of a well-known classic. “Frank was a cousin of my mother’s, a big, stout man, I remember him well,” he said. “He sang ‘Mammy’ by Al Johnson and was really good at it. He looked the part, but he was a referee as well. “I remember him refereeing one day in Claudy and there was a wee bit of a skirmish. I was playing at the time and he come up to me and says “Right Joe, what’s your name ” One set-piece from the show has caused Joseph no end of amusement throughout the years that followed. “There was a thing called the Tiny Tots,” he said. “My mother found all these cubs of three or four years of age. She had gathered up a kit for every county in Ireland. I don’t know how she did it, there were no O’Neill’s shops back then. “I don’t know whether she got someone to make all those jerseys, because I don’t think they did children’s jerseys back then in . “So as the wee lads came out dressed in whatever county it was, the chorus would have sung a verse of a song that would relate to that county. “I get grown men coming up to me when I’m out and telling me: “I remember being in the Tiny Tots – I was Wexford”. The Black and White Minstrel show was cancelled by the BBC in , but its  adaptation on the banks of the Moyola still brings fond memories to all who witnessed it.

Seonaidh Mullan, who played camogie and ladies’ football for Ballerin, ran a STEM cell registration event following her diagnosis to encourage people to register as donors. The event, hosted at the GAA club in Ballerin, resulted in over  donors registering as potential lesavers. Camogie club Chairperson Melinda Robinson said many in the community were grieving the loss of a friend. “Seonaidh was an extremely private person, very modest. There was no fuss with her. She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Schools officially closed because of the coronavirus pandemic on March . At the time, key workers were told that schools would remain open to provide supervised learning only for children who ‘absolutely need to attend’. Some parents have had dficulty finding places for their children including senior health care workers in the city. A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “Figures collected for Wednesday  April for Derry City and Strabane District Council showed that  schools responded to a daily survey as being open, with  children reported as attending open schools. Fty two schools responded as being closed. googletag.cmd.push “It should be noted that figures can fluctuate on a daily basis. Figures collected for the same day the previous week show that there were  children reported as being in open schools. “An interactive map displaying schools open for supervised learning can be accessed on the Education Authority website. This is updated daily.” According to today’s map, April , there are  schools open in Derry and the surrounding area but only three with pupils in attendance - Lisnagelvin P.S., Eglinton P.S. and Broadbridge P.S. Many people were unhappy with delays to school closures in the North. However, based on scientic advice on how to limit spread of the COVID- virus the decision was taken that children who can stay safely at home, should, to limit the chance of the virus spreading. googletag.cmd.push This is dferent in other countries and jurisdictions but is based on sound scientic advice, so that critical services can be maintained and the spread of the virus reduced. Parents and carers were advised to send their child to schoolthere is ‘no other viable option’. For many there is no other option at present, as childcare services have closed and people have been advised against leaving children with grandparents as they are amongst the high risk category. Supervised learning is about providing a facility in schools and pre-schools for vulnerable children and those of key and critical workers to allow parents to continue with their vital jobs.

Beforehand, people negatively on social media were saying these things have been talked about. “They were, but they were never agreed with management and DE . Everybody has now totally supported this workload agreement. “This deal will change people’s lives. It will make a definite improvement to work-le balance for everybody.” The Covid- outbreak has forced the union to use an online poll for what would ordinarily be decided by postal ballot and members have voiced opposition over the timing of the deal. Voting in the poll is currently underway and will continue until Wednesday evening at .pm. googletag.cmd.push Social media posts from INTO encouraging members to approve the deal have prompted criticism, with some members also feeling it doesn’t go far enough to meet their demands. “This deal has been agreed in principle since last June,” said Siobhan. “Other public sector workers had issues and then you had the nurses who really deserved to get theirs sorted out and then we were coming along next. It was always going to be now. “In the south Derry area, we have -odd members and a lot of very, very positive reps in schools. There is a positive vibe, people see it as it is. “There are nine dferent workstreams and six of them are to be acted upon immediately. The Minister and the deal is allowing people to get their house in order and then we look again.” The Maghera native feels the deal provides an opportunity for a realignment in what is expected of teachers within their roles. She said: “The word ‘inspector’ terries people, but ETIhave produced a ‘myth-busting’ document to outline what they are looking for from a school. “Sometimes teachers go beyond what they’re supposed to do, and this [deal] actually asks them to keep in mind from now what they are supposed to be doing. “It’s like a Gaelic player on the football pitch. They play their time and when the whistle is blown, they stop. They don’t go into extra time unless they are asked to. “Teachers keep going beyond what they are supposed to be doing and that’s what causes exhaustion, leaves them shattered within their job and negative towards everything .” Siobhan says approval of the deal would not be the end of the process, but a new beginning and that the union would be working to ensure its benefits impact on their members. She said: “A lot of people are quietly delighted. For a teacher at the top of the main scale, net back pay is going to be in the region of pound,. “There are so many positives in the recognition of trade union movements, consultation on workload. We intend to help members implement it to improve their work-le balance. “If you have happy teachers, you have happy pupils and happy pupils make happy families.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Terence McMacken played in the first ever game, has been player of the year and now holds the position of club secretary. He spoke to Michael McMullan... Last September, a bumper attendance flocked to a packed Roe Park Hotel in Limavady to mark  years of Dungiven Celtic. A celebration of a story that evolved from early jottings in the late s, before the club stretched its wings to fly to the top of intermediate football by the early noughties. The thriving youth scene means Dungiven Celtic is here to stay. Its all thanks to the people involved, according to club stalwart and current secretary Terence McMacken, as he carries the baton held by his late father John Joe. googletag.cmd.push All-time leading goalscorer Seamus Harkin is now the club chairman. Every week, the club fields seven -a-side teams, now has added a snowballing girls soccer string to its bow - under the leadership of James Doran - and last year hosted almost  kids at their annual summer camp. Currently, like every sporting venue around the globe, their Ballyguddin home lies dormant. The lock-down has left the sporting landscape a deserted one. For Dungiven Celtic, its a pit stop on a race that began in June . “Back then, there was a lot of summer soccer played,”McMacken outlines. “We played summer cups and people who were enthusiastic about the game got involved. Every townland would have had a team.” googletag.cmd.push Feeny FC were in vogue, playing their games where Banaghers Fr McNally Park is now situated. Many players from the Dungiven area would have turned out for them. They had the makings of a decent side, but soon dissolved. Almost immediately, Dernaflaw Rovers sprung up, playing mainly in cup competitions before the realisation dawned of a hunger for more action in a more regular and organised format. There was the inkling to join the Derry and District Sunday morning leaguefor the start of the   season. “A meeting was called in Sam ODonnells house and that is how it started.” McMacken adds. “Sam had played on the Feeny team at the time.” And there it was, Dungiven Celtic was founded. *** With the clubs green and white hooped jerseys on order from Seamus Dorans sports shop in Dungiven, the club kicked off their existence in ODonnells red and white striped kit. By the end of that season, the club were in the green, white and black colours associated with the club to this very day. It all began with a trip to the Brandywell on Sunday, August ,  for the clubs first game, against Moville who were one of the Donegal teams in the DD league. Vinny Hargan scored a hat-trick in the - win. Between the posts was Dungiven and Derry Gaelic goalkeeper John Sommers. Also on the team were stalwarts Gerard Kelly and Terence McMacken. “We didnt really know what to expect,” McMacken recalls. “We had played in friendlies at the time, there was no real social media, so we thought this would be a good Moville team wed be playing against. “We played very well. We may have been a bit inconsistent, but we had a lot of good footballers around here and were better than we gave ourselves credit for.” By the end of , the club won their first trophy when they ed victorious from the Brandywell with the McKinney Cup thanks to two goals from Hugh Doherty. “We beat Brandywell Harpsin the final and they were the top team in the city at the time, so that was a big win,” McMacken adds. Saturday football then began, when the club entered a team into the North West senior league, with many of the players mixing it with a DD game on a Sunday, as well as playing Gaelic games. At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop. There were local clubs, who wanted to play at a higher level, but had no outlet. Some people in the club said well not and others wanted to give it a go and see where it goes.” It was the beginning of the climb. *** In August , Jack Doherty was Dungivens goalscorer in a - defeat to Cookstown United at the Curragh Road in the intermediate league cup. The next leg of the journey began. In the team was Scot Dougie Wood, who had spells with Sunderland and Raith Rovers, before moving to Ireland, where he won both league and cup honours with Derry City. “He came to us in his mid-s and was Dungiven Celtics player manager until he was around ,” McMacken states. The clubs longest serving manager Jim McGroarty then came on board. A Lettershandoney man, he played with Finn Harps before going over the water to Stoke City. After ato Ireland, he had a spell with Sligo Rovers before going back to the Harps. “When we won our first intermediate trophy , we beat Derry City in the final of the North West Challenge Cup,” McMacken adds. “Dougie had stepped down as manager, Jim was back playing for Sligo on a Sunday, so he took over as manager.” Another constant during that era was Martin Hazlett, who sadly passed away last year. Terence McMackens diligent record keeping charts Hazletts  appearances for the club. He played in the clubs first game at intermediate level, was player of the year in the  season and picked up the award for the sixth time, some  years later.  Martin Hazlett celebrates cup glory for Dungiven Was he the clubs greatest player  “There is no doubt about it, he was a wonderful player,” came McMackens prompt reply. “He always came to play a game properly prepared and he was always in good shape. He took his football seriously and I always thought he couldve played where – a higher level.” Hazlett was very much a home bird and lived beside the pitch, playing right up until the clubs golden era at the late s and was the glue to pull the team together until the younger crop game along. “We had always had decent teams, but theleague was of a very high standard. Quite a number of the teams, they had people getting paid and were professional teams. We were holding our own, but were never good enough to win it.” In the Irish Cup, the club had two impressive runs during the s. They reached the sixth round in the   season, before going down to Loughgall. Along the way, they defeated local rivals Limavady United. The following season, they took on Irish League champions Crusaders at Seaview, going down - after giving a good account of themselves. It helped keep the momentum going and after knocking on the door for a few years, Intermediate league success was to follow. *** In the beginning, Dungiven Celtic played their games between the county school, a pitch on the Hass Road and on the Garvagh Road, where Paacuteirc na nOacuteg Gaelic pitch is now situated. “The council bought a field up at the Curragh Road and it has been developed into the Sport Centre,” McMacken points out. “Then we moved to Ballyguddin. We rented it for years and we eventually bought it and developed it. It was a field with fencing around. In , they dug it up and made a pitch out of it.” Terences father, John Joe, had got involved in the club after ing from Belfast where he was working and supporting Belfast Celtic. He was following the Derry and Dungiven GAA teams, before being asked to get involved in Dungiven Celtic. “He played major role in the club from then on. He kept it going in bad times during the troubles, when it was tough going,” said Terence, who later wrote a poem as a tribute to his late father. “He didnt get to see the pitch finished. When they came into work on the pitch, he died a week after.” Terence now looks after the pitch. Seamus Harkin hails the endless hours he puts into it. “Youll probably find him out there any way, just making sure it is in pristine condition.” Dermott McCloskey was another who poured his le into the club after his playing days, whether it was coaching or whatever needed done. “Dermott was a big influence in procuring the pitch on a permanent basis and developing it,” McMacken adds. Another club stalwart remembered at the club dinner was Patsy Donaghy. Not many Dungiven Celtic players will remember him not being around the club during his letime. He famously reminded Gerard Kelly to stay on his feet. “Get up Kelly, you need studs on your arse,” he would say. “Patsy was a permanent fixture,” McMacken recalls. “He never played, but he was the club linesman – one of those guys. Every club has them...and the flag was pointing one way most of the time.” So many offered time over the years to take Dungiven Celtic from Sam McDonnells house to their new home at Ballyguddin, but by the early s the first team was really beginning to come of age. McMacken, who would rather be watching the local underage blossom than watching soccer on the telly, remembers being down at the pitch one Saturday as the they young guns began to filter into the first team. An onlooker expressed how well the team was playing. “Ill tell you what...youve a team there for  years,” McMacken was told. And so there was. Of the  players that formed the crux of that squad about  of them wouldve been there all the way through. For most of a decade. “You might have had the odd boy going away to England or America, but it was dferent times then – boys were there to train and to play,” McMacken added. “We had a lot of boys playing Gaelic and hurling, they mixed it up the best. All three codes were doing very well. “The fact it was a community thing means there were days when you had to do without guys, thats the way it has to be.” It brought McMacken to the story of a weekend when Dungiven Celtic were down to play an Irish Cup tie in Belfast against Donegal Celtic, on the same Saturday Dungivens Gaelic team were set to play Bellaghy. The Belfast club accepted the request for an earlier kick-off to accommodate five players to jump into a car and head to Bellaghy. “We won -, they were a really good team. It was an outstanding game and our boys were shattered after it,” said McMacken. Emmett McKeever was man of the match and was one of the players on their way to Bellaghy for part two of their super Saturday. Dungiven beat Bellaghy and later the that night, McMacken was informed that McKeever was the star of the show for the second time that day. “I didnt even know how he was able to walk again after the way he played. There was two games where he was man of the match in one day.” It was the   season when the breakthrough came with the clubs first intermediate League title. They lost only once, to Strabane, during their -game march to glory. They were - down in one game, away to Roe Valley, before Seamus Harkins hat-trick pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. Harkin bagged another two goals in another important clash, as Celtic saw off Dergview and they never looked back. The following season was an even better one, with all three teams – firsts, reserves and thirds – all winning their respective league titles. The firsts needed to avoid defeat in the final game of the season in a decider with Strabane, a game that ended scoreless, and Dungiven had retained their title. Six days later a - win over Park saw the reserves crowned champions and the thirds made it a clean sweep, but they did it the hard way. After going six games without a win, they won  of the remaining  games. The firsts added the intermediate challenge cup and the McGrogan Memorial Cup, to round off a season that brought five trophies. After the gap of a year, Dungiven came back to win their third Intermediate League title to cement it as the clubs most memorable period. Fast forward to the present day and the future looks equally rosy. In recent years, the club were honoured by the IFA as the Club of the Year. “Dungiven Celtic Football has consistently excelled in its work for youth football in the local area,” read part of the response from the judging . “The club’s community work has also been exemplary having successfully managed to build signicant participation in the local area.” After becoming an established club, the award rubber-stamps their commitment to the future “We have come a long way and it can fall apart very quickly,” is the take of Terence McMacken. “It is like any other club, it depends on the people. We are lucky at the moment, we have very good people involved. What we have....one, two or three people couldnt do.” He refers to the parental support and how the club is run very much on the GAA model, for the community and with everyone rowing in behind each other. McMacken refers to other clubs in Dungivens league paying their players, but he is adamant their way is the one that needs to remain. “Theyhave loyalty, that is the big thing. It is hard to get that in soccer. It is a dferent game, there are dferent rules and it is run dferently. “We are playing teams on Saturdays where players are getting paid, where our guys are putting in a fiver to play. It is a thing we think is right.” The money goes towards the running of the club and all the admin fees that are hidden from the eye of a player every Saturday. The underage players all contribute a pound, which helps towards the booking of training facilities. Other clubs have players getting offered money here and there with goal bonuses. “Then there are clubs, like ourselves, who arent. I wouldnt like to see it changed. You are asking them to be part of a club, to sell tickets or whatever, the same as the six-year-olds.” The balls might be flying around Ballyguddin before the season is out, but the chances are they wont as players are kept tucked up at home for the safety of the nation in the facing the coronavirus outbreak. When the action s, the surface will be like a carpet and there will be smiles on the kids faces as they mix with their peers once again. The meeting in Sean ODonnells house was only the beginning. The club has been passed on, with interest. Its in a healthy state. Heres to the next  years.

I thought lsquothis is itrsquo and I wasnrsquot coming out of here, so to speak to someone from home like David Moore, who knew some of my relatives, and to get that reassurance from him meant so much.ldquoHe came into to see me each day I was at the Mater and had to be suited in PPE every time he came. It was just horric.Mr Bell does not yet know where he picked up the virus, orhe passed it on to anyone . Thankfully, his fianceacutee, Bernie Henry, who shares a home with him, did not contract the virus as they were both committed to social distancing as soon as he felt unwell.He said: ldquoI work all over Northern Ireland in my job, meeting people face to face, so I could have picked it up anywhere, said Mr Bell.ldquoThe first thing I knew about it was when I came home from work on the Friday [nearly three weeks ago] feeling a bit faint and ice cold in my feet and hands. I started to have really bad headaches.ldquoTwo days later I rang the out of hours and was toldthe headaches didnrsquot get any better to go to Lagan Valley Hospital which I did. They told me go home and to self-isolate for  days which we did.Mr Bellrsquos headaches continued and after consulting his own GP he went to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald where X-rays showed that his lungs were clear and he was sent home to continue his quarantine.Then, four days later, he called for paramedics again who prescribed him antibiotics but did not admit him to hospital.The day before he was admitted to the Mater Hospital ndash the gateway hospital for all suspected COVID patients ndash Mr Bell suffered an asthma attack and felt increasingly unable to breathe at home.His fianceacutee went on the NHS COVID app the next day to describe Mr Bellrsquos symptoms where it recorded a red warning and advised to ring .Mr Bell said: ldquoIf it wasnrsquot for that, God knows where I would have been today. It took it a week for it to really hit me but when it did, it was bad.He was treated initially with strong anti-biotics to open his airways and then with oxygen from a CPAP mask to get air into his lungs.Once medics believed that Mr Bell was on his way to recovery, he was transferred to the City Hospital.He said that he felt most vulnerable when he was in separate bay with five other patients with COVID-.ldquoItrsquos hard not to worry when you are in there as you see other people struggling, said Mr Bell.ldquoBecause of the pneumonia, it was a struggle to speak, for two days I couldnrsquot speak to anyone. Bernie was not allowed in to visit me so we would text. Once I told her how afraid I was and she rang the hospital and a doctor, who was a lovely guy, came in to speak to me and reassured me that the pneumonia had been stemmed.ldquoEveryone was so good, particularly Dr Suzy Guy and Dr Liggett, who first saw me at the Mater. You see these people on the television but little did I know that they would end up treating me please.

Itrsquos a service he says he and his staff have been proud to offer.He has pupils whose parents are key NHS medics, including a couple who are both respiratory consultants, and knows the need to provide a place of shelter and safety for children of key workers is critical.ldquoEvenI had to keep the school open for one child of an NHS worker, it would be worth it, he said. ldquoMy head has said lsquoshut the schoolrsquo like the rest of them, but my heart says we are in this together and wersquove got to do our part.ldquoHowever, Irsquom not condemning any school who has closed as they have probably done so for the best of reasons.ldquoI sat in tears on Sunday evening as I didnrsquot know what I was doing was right in keeping the school open or not. We are one of the few schools offering cover for the weekends and all over Easter. Not one of my staff refused to come in to take a turn to keep the school open.ldquoIrsquove had  or more people offering to come in and help. Irsquove a great staff and they all pull together. At the end of the day, we have done our very best to safeguard the children and staff.Thankfully, Mr Moore has not received any reports of coronavirus amongst his pupils and staff, and he hopes that this status will continue.Known for not taking himself too seriously, Mr Moore has been entertaining and educating his pupils with hilarious Facebook videos of himself as educator turned entertainer. Using his considerable wit and cuddly toys as pretend schoolchildren, the principal of  years has taught mathematics, the importance of punctuation and much more over the last few weeks.He describes the incoming principal, Mr Fegan, as ldquoalmost like a son to me, and is equally proud of his other two former vice-principals, Mr Niall Stevenson and Mrs Lorna Stitt , who left the school to become principals of Downpatrick Primary School and Portavogie Primary School respectively.Mr Moore taught in primary schools in Belfast and Lisburn after he qualying in . He came to Academy as vice-principal in September  and taught a composite P-P class.He took over as principal from Mr George Smyth just five years later. The school at that time only had  children mdash it now has  children registered with double classes in all year groups and the nursery.ldquoI was appointed acting principal and Irsquove been acting principal ever since, quips Mr Moore.ldquoThe highlights for me have been many. Itrsquos been a honour not only to see children develop and flourish, but also my staff. Irsquom delighted with how my vice principals have gone on in their careers and that Mr Fegan has now been confirmed as the incoming principal after first coming here as a student teacher.ldquoIrsquove taken as much pleasure at seeing how some of my former pupils have fared in their careers and le as much as our AQE results, which are excellent. The school has also had three outstanding inspection reports in my time and apart from perhaps three rooms, the school has been completely refurbished.ldquoThe children are great ambassadors and a lot of them go on to to Down High School or Saintfield High School or Belfast grammar schools and quite often end up as head boy or head girl.His official send-off mdash a special assembly with an eveningat Temple Golf Club on June  mdash has been postponed.ldquoPersonally, itrsquos not ideal but there are people losing their lives, incomes, jobs, business are crashing, doctors and nurses putting their lives on the line, I will come back at a later stage and there will be a chance for everyone to say goodbye,said Mr Moore.ldquoTo be honest, Irsquom more upset for the Ps as most of them have been with us for eight years. Wersquove had to cancel going to Edinburgh, their leaving show which was going to be The Lion King in my honour.He said that his greatest delight at the school has been his pupils.ldquoThey are the main reason for my y tenure. It has been a joy to be their principal, he added.ldquoIt has also been an honour to have worked alongside the board of governors, both past and present, who have shared my vision for the school and supported me in its realisation.ldquoI am indebted in particular to the late Rev Alan Delamere, Mr David Donnan, Mr Geoffrey Perrin and currently Mr Peter Shaw for their leadership at the helm.ldquoThe current members of our teaching and non-teaching staff continue to reflect the professional dedication and loving care of their predecessors. I have been truly blessed to have a staff who have had a collective desire to put children first.Mr Moore also paid tribute to the parents and s for their ldquodaily partnership with the staff and your personal support to me as principal for over two decades.He and his we, Lynne, who live in Saintfield, share five children together and he says retirement will bring him a chance for them both to travel ndash when the travel ban is lted ndash and for him to devote more time to his beloved sports mdash hersquos a major football and rugby fan.He has been approached to do some educational consultancy work when he is officially retired but is happy to limit that to just several days a week.Mr Moore added: ldquoI can honestly say that during my time at Academy I have never wished that I had been a school leader anywhere  or that I was employed in an alternative profession.ldquoI will definitely shed a tear or two when I go. They will get over me, of course, as nobody is irreplaceable, but I will certainly miss the children and staff. I will not miss the responsibility of the day to day running of the place, but Irsquom a social animal and I will really miss everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Legacy.jpg","title":"The legacy of John de Courcy  ","story":"THE story starts in  when the Norman soldier-adventurer, Sir John de Courcy, went north from Dublin, the headquarters of Norman power in Ireland, and arrived at Downpatrick on February .De Courcy was a man of great physical strength and size. He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
