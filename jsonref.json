At the center of the house is a circular room beneath a copper dome. The house is built on a large plot of land and because of buying up the surrounding properties around it over the years, Dylan has an enormous amount of privacy.            Dylan is alone there - aside from his security men - most of the time when he isn\u0027t touring. The singer-songwriter has a month off in the summer, which he spends with his children and grandchildren there          The singer has a half-sized basketball court on the estate. Dylan, a notorious womanizer, is known to have six children, including with first wife Sara Lownds and his secret wife Carolyn Dennis, and several grandchildren, who are said to spend time with him over the summer   A water tower sits on the property           Over the years, Dylan\u0027s neighbors have complained to city officials about the smells coming from an outdoor portable toilet, which is apparently used by guards on Dylan\u0027s compound          Horses and dogs roam the vast property, which is set back from the Pacific Ocean and accessed via a long winding dirt trackDylan is alone there - aside from his security men - most of the time when he isn\u0027t touring.

Why, when there should be much to unite the warring factions in the Commons, did MPs repudiate a perfectly sensible deal proposed by the Prime Minister only 16 days before we are due to leave the EU?I’m afraid there has been a very unBritish reluctance to compromise and an equally unBritish addiction to ideology — combined with a lamentable tendency to put narrow, factional party politics before the national interest.ObsessionIn the dock of shame stand the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), many Tories in the European Research Group (ERG) and the Labour front bench. Add some intransigent Remainers determined to undo the result of the referendum.Oh, and we mustn’t forget the equally doctrinaire and unbending EU mandarins in Brussels, who are so in love with their dream of a fledgling European superstate, so devoted to the sanctity of their precious rules, that they did only the bare minimum to help out Theresa May.Let’s consider those discreditable politicians who put party before country. Head of the queue is Jeremy Corbyn, whose obsession in recent months has been to force a general election which — I pray misguidedly — he is convinced Labour would win.Whereas Mrs May has had to grapple with reality, Labour has advocated policies that would never be acceptable to EU panjandrums — namely clear alignment with the single market and a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union including a say in future trade deals.          Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s obsession in recent months has been to force a general election which he is convinced Labour would winCorbyn has had the gall to accuse the Prime Minister of ‘fantasy’ but the idea that Britain could ever achieve Labour’s goals — amounting to all the privileges of EU membership without any of the obligations — is for the birds.The dishonesty is breathtaking. Instead of offering constructive criticism of Mrs May’s hard-won proposals, Labour has pretended that it has a viable alternative.Corbyn’s latest sleight of hand has been to accept a second referendum under pressure from Labour Remainers while continuing to scheme for the general election he craves.May\u0027s ministers will reveal at 7am which imports will be...Now even the ERG wants to DELAY Brexit: Hardcore Leavers...Share this articleWhy wouldn’t he, in the national interest, make common cause with Mrs May? Because his overriding preoccupation has been to secure an election so that he can unleash his barmy Marxist experiment on unsuspecting Britons.In some ways the DUP — all of whose ten MPs voted against Mrs May’s deal last night — aren’t much better. A recent poll suggests that voters in Northern Ireland are overwhelmingly opposed to a hard Brexit such as has been championed by the DUP.Some 67 per cent of voters (including many unionists) say the party is doing a bad job of representing the province at Westminster. In other words, the hard-line DUP doesn’t speak for the majority in Northern Ireland.          Most of the European Research Group, including its chair Jacob Rees-Mogg voted against Mrs May’s deal, even though by so doing they plunged this country into a period of uncertainty which could result in our staying inNor does the party generally consider the wider interests of the UK, of which it says it is so happy to be a part. On the contrary, it is an extremist sect with a dark past which pursues its interests without regard either to the rest of the UK or most people in the province.To be fair, more reasonable elements in the DUP might have been won over, not least because they realise how out of step they are with public opinion in Northern Ireland, if the Attorney General had not made such a pig’s ear of his legal advice yesterday.Having established that the concessions wrung from the EU by Mrs May on Monday night ‘enhance’ her deal, Geoffrey Cox nonetheless insisted that the risk of the UK being tied to EU rules over the so-called Backstop ‘remains unchanged’.How can this be? If the terms are better, the risks must be less. Though he looks every inch the grandiloquent lawyer, my friends at the Bar say his judgment is not universally venerated by his peers. He let down his country yesterday.And that brings me to the Tories of the ERG since I’ll skip over Remainers in the Cabinet such as Amber Rudd and David Gauke, who recently weakened Mrs May’s hand in her negotiations with Brussels by insisting she take No Deal off the table.I had hopes of the ERG. Excepting a hard-core of ignorant and irrevocably stubborn characters, many of them are principled and well-informed MPs who have tirelessly championed the cause of Brexit.And yet last night most of them — with a few notable exceptions such as former Brexit Secretary David Davis — voted against Mrs May’s deal even though by so doing they plunged this country into a period of uncertainty which could result in our staying in.          Also in the dock of shame stand the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (pictured left to right: Dianne Dodds MEP, leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds) who also voted against Mrs May\u0027s deal IdiociesWhy in God’s name could they not compromise? Here was perhaps the only opportunity we will ever have to escape the EU. Three years ago they would have almost died for such an outcome. Now they are likely to get very much less — or nothing at all.Beware ideologues. And those, such as Corbyn and the bigots of the DUP, who put their parties in front of their country. It grieves me to say this, but it seems we are cursed with a Parliament dominated by knaves and fools who really have abandoned the people they represent.          I don’t know whether Mrs May will be defenestrated or whether she will struggle on. But who will save our stricken nation?And now? I normally recoil from loose talk of a ‘national crisis’. But we have one now. Coming into work yesterday morning, I looked around my railway carriage and saw only hard-working and dutiful people whose thoughts seemed a thousand miles from the idiocies of Brexit.The crisis is not of their making. Leavers or Remainers, they want only to get on with their lives, and not to have their jobs threatened or their wealth and happiness undermined — and Great Britain weakened and made the laughing stock of the world.I don’t know whether Mrs May will be defenestrated or whether she will struggle on. Conceivably she will limp back one more time. Parliament will try to wrest control.Today, No Deal is certain to be rejected by MPs. Tomorrow, they will probably vote for an extension to Article 50, which will enable the EU to dictate onerous terms.Who will save our stricken nation? Ahead I can only see more chaos and turmoil unless politicians miraculously stop gouging out one another’s eyes — and put our country first."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/12/22/12883F0A00000514-0-image-m-15_1552429816232.jpg","title":"HENRY DEEDES dramatic day MPs turned backs Brexit","story":"    Hammer blow: Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg joined the No lobby along with other MPsFor here had been a golden chance to deliver the will of the people.

It arrived via Attorney General Geoffrey Cox’s office. The Government’s legal adviser announced he would not be changing his legal advice on the backstop.Mr Cox can hardly be blamed. He was fully behind the deal. But legal assurances are never 100 per cent science. Despite attempts by Brussels to smear him as an out-of-his-depth pantomime horse, Respect for the Attorney General remained undiminished. He had put principle before party.Self-satisfied Dominic Grieve (Con, Beaconsfield) congratulated him for ‘speaking truth to power’. Joanna Cherry (SNP, Edinburgh South West) said Mr Cox had ‘burst his party’s political bubble for the sake of professional integrity’.          Mrs May\u0027s voice went during the marathon session in the Commons yesterday for another meaningful voteBy the time the Prime Minister entered the chamber after Mr Cox was done her deal was doomed. Scotched by the naysayers. One by one, the grinning lemmings had leapt into the abyss.On the front bench, ministers were tapping their phones, and whispering to each other behind their hands conspiratorially. Behind, empty spaces everywhere.Clearly someone had let cry to begin manning the lifeboats.Taking her seat, Mrs May looked up at her husband in the visitors’ gallery and gave a resigned shrug.When she began speaking, it became clear why. Her voice was croakier than a bullfrog. ‘You should hear Jean-Claude Juncker,’ she squawked.The Opposition peppered her with interventions, drawing things out. Up in the Press seats we wondered if her voice would even last the course.          There were 75 Tory rebels - down from 118 last time - as well as all 10 DUP MPs. Just three Labour MPs backed the deal. The Prime Minister got back about 40 MPs from the January 15 voteIain Duncan Smith (Con, Chingford) manfully passed a tablet down to the front bench. A cough sweet? Considering how her colleagues had behaved, few would have blamed her for snaffling a cyanide capsule with equal enthusiasm. As it was, Mrs May had little new to add. The red meat of her negotiations had already been announced by her Attorney General. And frankly he said it all much better. Nor did Jeremy Corbyn have much to say. A more skilled statesman might have given the wounded PM the velvet glove treatment, like a leopard toying with its prey. But no. Rant, rant, rant he went as usual. The occupancy of the chamber at this point had dwindled. It may not have helped Mr Corbyn that he eventually got to speak just moments before the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham was due off. I know what I’d rather have been watching.Once members headed for the voting lobby, the naysayers had taken to Twitter to their express their intentions. All was lost. The Prime Minister dutifully returned to the bridge to accept her fate.Good show. Meanwhile, of her hubby there was no sign.

In both cases, they recovered quickly after disconnecting the autopilot.As described by the pilots, however, the problem did not appear related to a new automated anti-stall system that is suspected of contributing to a deadly October crash in Indonesia.The Max 8 is at the center of a growing global ban by more than 40 countries following a second fatal crash, this time in Ethiopia, in less than five months. In the U.S., however, the Federal Aviation Administration and airlines continued to permit the planes to fly.American Airlines and Southwest Airlines operate the 737 Max 8, and United Airlines flies a slightly larger version, the Max 9. All three carriers vouched for the safety of Max aircraft on WednesdayThe pilot reports were filed last year in a data base compiled by NASA. They are voluntary safety reports and do not publicly reveal the names of pilots, the airlines or the location of the incidents.          An American Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8, on a flight from Miami to New York City, comes in for landing at LaGuardia Airport in New York on TuesdayIt was unclear whether the accounts led to any actions by the FAA or the pilots\u0027 airlines.In one report, an airline captain said that immediately after putting the plane on autopilot, the co-pilot called out \u0027Descending,\u0027 followed by an audio cockpit warning, \u0027Don\u0027t sink, don\u0027t sink!\u0027The captain immediately disconnected the autopilot and resumed climbing.\u0027With the concerns with the MAX 8 nose down stuff, we both thought it appropriate to bring it to your attention,\u0027 the captain wrote. \u0027Best guess from me is airspeed fluctuation\u0027 due to a brief weather system overwhelming the plane\u0027s automation.On another flight, the co-pilot said that seconds after engaging the autopilot, the nose pitched downward and the plane began descending at 1,200 to 1,500 feet per minute. As in the other flight, the plane\u0027s low-altitude-warning system issued an audio warning. The captain disconnected autopilot, and the plane began to climb.The pilots talked it over later, \u0027but can\u0027t think of any reason the aircraft would pitch nose down so aggressively,\u0027 the co-pilot recounted.Preliminary information released by Indonesian investigators suggests they are looking at the possible role of the Max\u0027s new automated anti-stall technology as a factor in a Lion Air crash in October shortly after takeoff from Jakarta. Data indicates that the pilots struggled with repeated nose-down commands from the plane before it crashed into the Java Sea and killed 189 people.However, that anti-stall system - called MCAS for its acronym - only activates if the autopilot is turned off, according to documents Boeing has shared with airlines and the FAA.\u0027That\u0027s not to say it\u0027s not a problem, but it is not the MCAS,\u0027 said Dennis Tajer, an American Airlines pilot who received additional training on the Boeing anti-stall system after the Lion Air crash. \u0027The autopilot has to be off for MCAS to kick in.\u0027American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said the airline has received no reports from pilots about problems with the anti-stall technology. Southwest has said the same thing.Concern about the Max\u0027s safety seemed to be abating but returned on Sunday when an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board. Again, preliminary data appears to capture a brief and erratic flight. Investigators will analyze information from the planes so-called black boxes in hopes of understanding what caused the accident.            A man searching for personal effects belonging to his brother who was a passenger on ET 302 speaks to a journalist and Recovery worker at the crash site of Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET 302 on Tuesday in Bishoftu, Ethiopia. All 157 passengers and crew perished in the crashThat followed the October crash of a new Lion Air jet of the same model in Indonesia, which killed 189 people shortly after takeoff from Jakarta.The widening actions against the aircraft puts pressure on Boeing -- the world\u0027s biggest plane manufacturer -- to prove the MAX planes are safe, and the company has said it is rolling out flight software updates by April that could address issues with a faulty sensor.The full extent of the impact of the aircraft bans on international travel routes was unclear. There are about 350 MAX 8 planes currently in service around the world.Southwest Airlines Co, American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines said they were still confident in their fleets. Southwest and American have both said their fleet data showed the plane was safe.U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao flew aboard a Southwest 737 MAX 8 on Tuesday to Washington from Austin, according to two people briefed on the matter. A spokesman for Chao did not immediately comment.However airlines and governments around the world have begun taking action to ground the planes. Air Canada, for example, announced it was canceling flights to London following Britain\u0027s decision to ban the aircraft.The EU aviation safety agency also closed European airspace to all MAX planes.It noted that the \u0027exact causes\u0027 of the Lion Air crash were still being investigated.\u0027At this early stage of the related investigation, it cannot be excluded that similar causes may have contributed to both events,\u0027 the agency added. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/13/01/04B47F46000003E8-6802109-image-a-1_1552438949927.jpg","title":"Ban Sky Bet advert gambling standards watchdog brands unrealistic","story":"    The ad, seen in August, was narrated by football presenter Jeff Stelling, pictured on Sky TVLabour\u0027s Brexit betrayal will tear my party apart: Leave...Drone no-fly zones will be extended from 1km to 5km...Share this articleSky Bet said the ad made no reference to knowledge increasing someone\u0027s chances of winning but added that it was accepted that knowledge of a specific sport would on the whole increase a consumer\u0027s chances of success.Upholding the complaints, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the ad placed strong emphasis on the role of sports knowledge in determining betting success.The ASA said: \u0027We acknowledged it was the case that those with knowledge of a particular sport may be more likely to experience success when betting.           Sky Bet said the ad made no reference to knowledge increasing someone\u0027s chances\u0027However, we considered that the ad gave an erroneous perception of the extent of a gambler\u0027s control over betting success, by placing undue emphasis on the role of sports knowledge.\u0027We considered that this gave consumers an unrealistic and exaggerated perception of the level of control they would have over the outcome of a bet and that could lead to irresponsible gambling behaviour.

He has sadly spent most of his adult life here at Dogs Trust after being found wandering the streets as a pup. \u0027Greyhounds can remain in the care of Dogs Trust for a while, often because of perceptions around their breed an example of this would be potential dog owners believing Greyhounds need lots of exercise, and Stevie is no exception to this phenomena. \u0027Despite being a stunning boy he has yet to meet the right family for him.           The Dogs Trust staff believe that Stevie is a victim of assumptions that Greyhounds need a lot of exercise and physical activity\u0027He is a real entertainer who is sure to make you laugh out loud at his antics. Despite being a loveable clown, he is a very smart dog who picks up things very quickly and is keen to learn. \u0027He loves to be the centre of attention and doesn’t like being left alone for long periods of time. He’s happy to walk with other dogs that he knows and is always pleased to meet new people.\u0027 And Stevie isn\u0027t the only long-term resident at the Dog\u0027s Trust looking for a permanent home.Monty, a six-year-old English Pointer, has been at the rehoming centre in Basildon since November 2016, after being found as a stray.          Monty, a six-year-old English Pointer, is also looking for a new home after being found as a stray in Basildon in November 2016He is fully housetrained, knows basic commands and loves his rope toys and tennis balls. Monty needs to live in an adult-only home with no visiting children and may need some time and patience to settle with his new family. He would like to be the only pet and will need someone around for most of the day initially. Bertie, six, is a cross-breed and has been at the Dogs Trust centre in West Calder for four years. He is a fun-loving boy who enjoys ball games and is described as being an expert at catch with great control when playing football.           Cross-breed Bertie is a fun-loving six-year-old who is very good at ball games. He has been with the Dogs Trust for four yearsBertie also has a very keen nose and is very good at finding the teddy bear that staff at the centre sometimes hide. The adorable six-year-old will need a quiet and relaxed new home and any new owners will need to visit the centre a few times before taking him home, in order to build a bond. Five-year-old Clarence is another cross-breed who has been housed at the Dogs Trust in Ilfracombe since December 2016. He has an charming lion\u0027s mane of hair and his small size makes him a perfect companion for people looking for someone to cuddle.           Clarence, five, is another cross-breed who has been housed at the Dogs Trust in Ilfracombe since December 2016Although Clarence loves to be fussed over, he can be quite shy around strangers and so needs an adult-only home without any other dogs. However, he does enjoy walking with other canines and will quickly make new friends in his new area. Clarence needs a quiet and settled home, where he will have his owner\u0027s unided attention. He will need some more training and support from the Dogs Trust so new owners shouldn\u0027t be further than an hour away, if possible.             Ollie, 11, is a Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross and has been a resident at the Glasgow Rehoming Centre for three yearsThe oldest of the five, Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross Ollie is 11 and has been a resident at the Glasgow Rehoming Centre for three years. However, despite his age he is very agile and energetic and will need space to stretch his legs. Ollie will need to be kept on a lead in public areas, meaning that a new home with a private garden would be preferred, to give him some freedom. He needs a gentle home and time and space to settle. The Staffie Cross would need someone around for most of the day initially, to help build up the length of time he can be left on his own. His new owners would also need to visit him at the Rehoming Centre  to build a bond before he goes home.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Labour vote block no deal tonight","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn, pictured today, is expected to whip Labour MPs to vote against a no deal Brexit in the House of Commons tonight          It comes after Labour helped block Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal in last night\u0027s vote, with the Prime Minister\u0027s plan defeated by 149 votes          The Prime Minister\u0027s hopes of saving her deal after a last minute dash to Strasbourg late on Tuesday turned to ashes in the Commons last night as the new concessions were hammered by MPsHours before MPs vote on stopping no-deal Brexit, ministers...Smugglers\u0027 paradise?

Mr Corbyn, pictured at his London home today, wants a General Election to be called and, if successful, would put forward his own plan to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU Pressed on Labour\u0027s position on a second referendum she said: \u0027We have not ruled out a People\u0027s Vote but our priority is securing a deal.\u0027Labour MPs were previously whipped to oppose a no deal Brexit in January when they helped narrowly pass the Spelman amendment, a non-binding motion calling for the scenario to be ruled out.  Mrs May has given Conservative MPs a free vote tonight, meaning they can vote with their conscience rather than follow the party line.Mrs May has indicated she will vote against no deal, and with Labour\u0027s support it is likely a majority in Parliament will follow suit.It is expected to be a very different result from last night, when just three Labour MPs - John Mann, Caroline Flint and Kevin Barron - voted for the Government\u0027s deal to leave.  Hours before tonight\u0027s vote, ministers announced worrying new tariffs that are likely to provoke more accusations of scaremongering after months of apocalyptic warnings about the impact of a no deal Brexit. Under the no deal plan revealed this morning, 87 per cent of products would be subject to zero tariffs in an effort to stop price spikes and kick-start trade with Britain from across the world.But ministers said products from the EU including beef, pork, chicken, butter, cheese and fish would also be subject to import taxes expected to push up prices in the supermarkets from March 29 if there is no deal.          Labour\u0027s opposition - and the deal\u0027s rejection by 75 Brexiteer Tory rebels alongside the DUP - sunk Mrs May\u0027s motion last night with Boris Johnson saying Mrs May should put her deal to bed          There were 75 Tory rebels - down from 118 last time - as well as all 10 DUP MPs. Just three Labour MPs backed the deal. The Prime Minister got back about 40 MPs from the January 15 voteCars from the EU would be subject to a a 10.6 per tax on the cost of all \u0027fully finished\u0027 vehicles - making the prices of an average vehicle surge by £1,500.However in a seemingly confusing loophole in no deal plan, Northern Ireland\u0027s border would remain open at least \u0027temporarily\u0027 and goods entering from the Republic would not face tariffs to preserve the Good Friday agreement. The situation will raise fears that the Northern Irish border could become a smuggling route for EU products.With just 17 days until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU, hardline Eurosceptics sided with Labour last night to inflict a crushing 149-vote defeat on the Prime Minister.A delay to the March 29 departure date is now almost certain. Mrs May\u0027s massive defeat also opens the door to drastic options such as a general election or second referendum.Speaking in Strasbourg, where the European Parliament is gathering for a debate on Brexit ahead of the next European Council summit, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said: \u0027Again the House of Commons says what it doesn\u0027t want. Now this impasse can only be solved in the UK.\u0027Amid speculation about how long she can survive in Downing Street, the Prime Minister\u0027s aides insisted she had not considered resigning. Boris Johnson is among leadership candidates sizing up their chances. "},{"url":null,"title":"Youve won inconsiderate parkers prize Mother fours shock neighbour leaves note","story":"    The mother-of-four was about to take her youngest child to school when she found this \u0027petty\u0027 note on her windscreen          Chelsey Chara, pictured with her partner Robin, was shocked to find the note on her Vauxhall Zafira parked near her home          The mother-of-four was accused of being inconsiderate for her parking job.

File photograph: GettyIrish teenagers have been ranked among the highest binge drinkers in the world, by a new global study of adolescent health. Irish teenage girls ranked third in the global table of the worst binge drinkers, behind Denmark, and Finland. All three countries received ‘red’ health grades in the area, where the prevalence of binge drinking was found to be higher than 55 per cent among the adolescent population. The study, published by The Lancet on Wednesday, found the prevalence of binge drinking was higher among Irish teenage girls than boys. However Irish teenage boys also received a red grade in the area, ranking among the highest binge drinkers compared to other countries. Over 70 per cent of teenage girls in Denmark reported binge drinking in the last twelve months, compared to 65 per cent in Finland, and 61 per cent of Irish teenage girls. Irish teenage girls also had a higher prevalence of smoking than teenage boys, at 13 per cent of those studied, compared to 12 per cent of boys.Teenage girls in Greenland topped the table for the prevalence of smoking, at nearly a third of adolescents, followed by over quarter of teens in Bulgaria, then Chile, and Croatia. ObesityThe study tracked teenagers’ health across a number of indicators, from 195 countries, between 1990 and 2016. The research found the number of obese teenagers had more than doubled over the two and a half decade period.In 2016, nearly one in five teenagers in the world were overweight or obese, the study said. Researchers said this rise was not down to broader population increases, but the growing prevalence of obesity among teenagers. Irish adolescent boys had a higher prevalence of being obese or overweight, compared to girls. Irish boys had a recorded rate of being overweight or obese of 32 per cent, compared to 23 per cent of girls, the study said.The number of teenagers who reported binge drinking saw a small increase between 1990 and 2016. Some 71 million adolescents (aged between 15 and 19 years of age) reported binge drinking in 2016, which broke down to 44m teenage boys, and 27m girls. This was up from 41m boys and 26m girls in 1990, the study said.

File Photograph: David YoungPA Britain will not introduce any new checks or controls on goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, including no customs declarations for normal goods. Announcing a series of “strictly temporary, unilateral” measures on Wednesday morning, the British government said its priority would be to enter into discussions with the European Commission and the Irish Government to jointly agree long-term measures to avoid a hard Border.Britain also announced a temporary tariff regime for a no-deal scenario but said it would not apply tariffs on goods crossing the Border into Northern Ireland. It will be for the Irish Government and for the EU to determine what measures might be applied on goods crossing the Border from Northern Ireland into Ireland.However, goods entering the rest of the UK from the Republic of Ireland would face tariffs which will be high in some sectors and be a particular threat to the Irish beef and dairy sectors, who sell a large proportion to the British market.The decision not to apply tariffs to goods crossing the Border means that although Britain will impose tariffs on beef and dairy products, all Irish beef and dairy products will be able to enter Northern Ireland tariff-free.“The government has been clear that a deal with the European Union is the best outcome for Northern Ireland. But we will do all we can to support people and businesses across Northern Ireland in the event that we leave without a deal. The measures announced today recognise the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland. These arrangements can only be temporary and short-term,” Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley said.Goods arriving from Ireland into Northern Ireland would still be subject to the same VAT and excise duty as today and the British government would continue to collect these taxes on Irish goods. Small businesses trading across the Border and not currently VAT-registered would be able to report VAT online periodically without any new processes at the Border.Animals and animal products from countries outside the EU would have to enter Northern Ireland through a designated entry point. Regulated plant material from outside the EU and high-risk EU plant material will require certification and pre-notification. New import requirements would also apply to imports of endangered species and hazardous chemicals.The measures were announced ahead of a vote at Westminster on Wednesday night on a motion ruling out a no-deal Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

More than half of Irish beef exports go to the UK and the Irish food industry fears that Britain will allow a quantity of certain food products to be imported tariff-free from countries such as Brazil, New Zealand and Australia.EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier expressed regret at the Westminster vote on Tuesday night, adding that the impasse could only be resolved in Britain. “The EU has done everything it can to help get the withdrawal agreement over the line,” he said.A spokesman for European Council president Donald Tusk echoed those sentiments and reminded Britain that any extension of the article 50 deadline would have to be approved by all 27 EU leaders.“The EU for its part continues to stand by the withdrawal agreement including the backstop, which serves to prevent a hard border in Ireland and preserve the integrity of the single market unless and until alternative arrangements can be found,” the spokesman said.“With only 17 days left to 29th March, today’s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. We will continue our no-deal preparations and ensure that we will be ready if such a scenario arises. Should there be a UK reasoned request for an extension, the EU27 will consider it and decide by unanimity. The EU27 will expect a credible justification for a possible extension and its duration. The smooth functioning of the EU institutions will need to be ensured.”Government sources in Dublin said the outcome of the vote was “regrettable” and added that “we’re now further intensifying our preparations for a no-deal Brexit”. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the onus was now on Britain to come up with solutions. He said a no-deal Brexit was “a lose-lose-lose for everybody” but avoiding such an outcome needed the Westminster parliament to “buy into the process and agree something which this evening they couldn’t do”.Government spokesmen declined to be drawn on British tariffs on EU goods and arrangements on the Border in the event of a no-deal outcome. With no-deal fears growing, the proposals will be closely watched in Dublin and the North.British business groups reacted angrily to last night’s vote, with Caroline Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), calling for the main parties to work together to find a deal.“Conservatives must consign red lines to history, Labour must come to the table with genuine commitment to solutions. It’s time to stop this circus,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Bulent KilicAFPGetty ImagesIslamic State may be on the brink of defeat in Syria, but its ideology remains a potent recruitment tool. In the American midwest, a region that has proved fertile ground for the terror group and other extremist recruiters, communities and law enforcement officials face a new challenge: dealing with returning jihadists and dozens of extremists due for release from prison in the coming years.According to the programme on extremism run by George Washington University in the US capital, Minnesota and Ohio make up two of the three US states with the highest per capita rate of iniduals travelling to join Islamic State, also known as Isis.The attraction to the terror group remains a worry for US authorities. Last October, 19-year-old Naser Almadoaji, an Iraqi-born US citizen from Dayton, Ohio, was arrested while attempting to board an aircraft to Kazakhstan, from where he planned to cross into Afghanistan and join up with an Islamic State affiliate group.Almadoaji, who attended a school in the suburban district of Beavercreek until 2015 and worked at a local supermarket, also attempted to make contact with an unnamed terrorist group after travelling to Egypt and Jordan last year.Laith Alebbini (28), also from Dayton, was arrested before attempting to fly to Syria in April 2017. Prosecutors say Alebbini has since been open about his support for Islamic State.“Frankly, the threat of international terrorism is something that is present in Dayton, in the southern district of Ohio and throughout the country,” Ben Glassman, the US attorney for the southern district of Ohio, told reporters in December. Contacted by phone, several people involved with the local Muslim community in Dayton refused to comment on whether radicalisation was a concern among their community.AttacksOhio has experienced several Islamic State-related attacks and near misses in recent years. In November 2016, a Somali refugee was shot dead in the state capital, Columbus, after staging a car and knife attack that was later claimed by Islamic State.A month later, a 20-year-old Islamic State sympathiser from Cincinnati was sentenced to 30 years in prison after buying automatic rifles and ammunition that police officers say he planned to use to attack government targets in Washington DC. At least eight people from Ohio have been charged with attempting to travel to Syria or Iraq to join Islamic State, and one, Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud from Columbus, returned with plans to conduct a terrorist attack.Minnesota, a largely rural state bordering Canada, has the highest per-capita rate of iniduals in any US state travelling to join extremist groups in Syria, Iraq and Somalia. In November 2017, a 20-year-old man stabbed and badly injured two people at a mall in Bloomington, Minnesota. The perpetrator, Mahad Abdiraham, said his actions were to “answer the call of jihad.” Abdiraham received a 15-year jail term but may be eligible for release in 2026.More than 40 per cent of those who left the US to join extremist groups such as Islamic State and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, remain unaccounted for, and while President Donald Trump has called on European countries to repatriate Islamic State fighters from Syria, he has refused to allow American extremists, such as Hoda Muthana, a 24-year-old woman from Alabama, return to the US.Disengagement programmeSome “rehab for terrorists” successes have been recorded. Minnesota is home to the first de-radicalisation programme in the country, the Minnesota Extremist Disengagement Program, which works with defendants formerly involved with foreign and American terrorist organisations but who are deemed fit for temporary release before sentencing.Of 30 people charged with involvement with foreign terrorist organisations in the district, 12 were deemed suitable to take part in the programme. Of those 12, 10 completed it successfully. While the number of participants is too few to definitively call it a success, its results are promising.Still, the dearth of de-radicalisation programmes is concerning for many. About 80 people convicted of terrorist-related crimes are set for release from US prisons in the coming five years. No disengagement programmes exist in American prisons for ex-jihadists, and funding, Lowry says, is hugely lacking.Judges in Minnesota and Ohio have been forced to place iniduals convicted of terrorist-related offences in halfway houses or delay their sentencing because, upon their release, there are insufficient facilities to help with their specific reintegration needs."},{"url":null,"title":"mardi gras celebrations new orleans pictures","story":"From children clamouring for tossed strands of beads, to revellers dressed up as blind referees poking fun at the NFL, to high school bands marching down the street, people in New Orleans, USA, celebrated Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) with flair and fun.Here: A members of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure ClubComment: Surrounded by spoilt children, Mrs May is the only grown-up in the roomBrexit vote latest news: Cabinet split over no deal vote as Theresa May tries to keep control of BrexitBen Nevis avalanche: Three climbers killed and one injured after being \u0026#39wiped out\u0026#39Comment: This Parliament will not embrace a no-deal Brexit, but Tory MPs will woo party members by fighting for itPolling reveals the 6 reasons Theresa May should call a general election - but one big one why she shouldn\u0026#39tThe hidden perils that make Ben Nevis so dangerous – from an ex-Royal Marine explorerComment: Our MPs are about to vote away a brilliant opportunity for a free trading BritainHow likely is a no-deal Brexit?

What we are hearing is the biggest change in terms of trade this country has faced since the mid-19th century being imposed on this country with no consultation with business, no time to prepare,” she told the BBC’s Today programme.Theresa May has lost control of Brexit“This is no way to run a country. What we potentially are going to see is this imposition of new terms of trade at the same time as business is blocked out of its closest trading partner. This is a sledgehammer for our economy.”Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said abrupt changes to tariffs would be an “unwelcome shock” for businesses.“If the government were to bring these tariffs into effect on 30 March, the move would also have the potential to cede negotiating leverage in future trade talks.\u0026nbsp“While ministers have clearly listened to our arguments and maintained targeted protection in some areas, overall there has not been enough consultation, preparation or planning to support the firms and communities that could find themselves at the end of a sudden shift in tariffs. As MPs vote tonight, this is yet another reason why they must act to avoid a messy and disorderly exit from the EU on March 29.”The government also announced there would not be any new checks or controls on goods moving from the Irish Republic\u0026nbspto Northern Ireland.Garda in Ireland are concerned that\u0026nbspcould prove to be lucrative for potential smugglers and existing criminal networks in the country and across the border.Tariffs will apply to goods including beef, lamb, pork, poultry and some dairy products in an attempt to protect farmers but the NFU said this would not be enough.But Irish European affairs minister, Helen\u0026nbspMcEntee\u0026nbspsaid the move would be “absolutely disastrous for Irish agriculture”.NFU president Minette Batters said\u0026nbspit was appalling that farmers only now have the\u0026nbspopportunity to see tariff rates\u0026nbsp- a fortnight before they could come into effect.\u0026nbsp“Farmers and food businesses have no time to prepare for the implications, which will be exacerbated by the fact that we will face tariffs on our own exports on food into the EU and other countries with whom we currently enjoy free trade arrangements.\u0026nbsp“Although we are pleased to see that the government has listened to our concerns and elected to treat many agricultural sectors sensitively, which may support farmers who are already facing disastrous disruption from no-deal, it is enormously worrying that some sectors will not have this protection – noticeably eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables.\u0026nbsp“Even those sectors that are treated sensitively will, in most instances, see worrying and large reductions in the tariff rates currently charged on non-EU imports.\u0026nbsp“Furthermore, the approach taken by the government to lump products under the same high-level tariff code, for example whole carcases and high value cuts of fresh beef, means there is a high chance of market distortion for many sectors who are deemed to have been treated sensitively.”It comes after Theresa May lost a crunch vote on her Brexit deal in the Commons on Tuesday night.We’ll tell you what’s true.

In 2008, he joined Lehman Brothers on an industrial placement as part of his degree at the University of Bath. Within three months, global financial markets had spiralled into meltdown leading to the collapse of the fourth largest investment bank in the US, and battering swathes of other financial institutions beyond recognition.Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs and the global economy crumbled. Reflecting on that time, the now 30-year-old understands that he was much more fortunate than some of his older colleagues. As a bright-eyed graduate he was swiftly snapped up by one of the global investment banks that had emerged from the crash bruised but still breathing. He stayed with that organisation until 2012, when he took five months off to go travelling.“I was completely uninspired,” Rocha-Thomas, who now lives in Cambridge, says of his former employer. “The IT team I was part of was so far removed from any kind of purpose,” he adds. So when he got back to the UK, he decided to join The App Business, a start-up which helps large companies build mobile apps. At the time the company\u0026nbsphad 20 employees. In the seven years that Rocha-Thomas has been there, the workforce has ballooned to almost 200 and he feel like he\u0027s been instrumental in driving that expansion. He says it\u0027s been incredibly rewarding and has given him an immense sense of purpose.Rocha-Thomas\u0027 story is becoming increasingly common. Although graduate schemes at banks, consultancies and accounting firms for years represented a well-trodden path for many bright youngsters leaving top universities, signs have emerged that even some of the most prestigious employers are starting to lose their shine.How Lehman Brothers caused \u0027the worst financial crisis in history\u0027According to a study published last year by High Flyers, a market research company which specialises in student and graduate recruitment, employers in eight out of 13\u0026nbspkey industries and employment areas hired fewer graduates in 2017 than the year before, with the biggest drops in recruitment at the top accounting and professional services firms, and banking and financial companies.Just 9.6 per cent of all graduates surveyed applied for roles in investment banking, which represented the lowest proportion since 2009 when banks halted graduate recruitment in the wake of the global financial crisis. And over the past year, that trend is expected to have continued.\u0026nbspWhile some of the move is likely to have been driven by companies cutting their recruitment budget in the face of Brexit uncertainty and other economic pressures, experts say that increased competition from booming tech companies and entrepreneurial start-ups is also to blame.Created with Sketch.

Start-ups are tapping into this sentiment by offering professional newbies the opportunity to have an impact from the get go – something that would ordinarily be unthinkable in a large multinational.Gian Power worked at Deutsche Bank and PwC after graduating from Aston Business School in 2014. He quit big corporate life in 2017 to set up his own company called The Lion\u0027s Club, which brings together motivational speakers on subjects around well-being, work-life-balance, and overcoming challenges to reach your full personal and professional potential.Gian PowerYouTube)“When working at PwC, my hours were long and I spent most weekends studying. It was a sacrifice I chose to make but it was hard to find time to explore my own interests and purpose,” he says. “I wanted to be my own boss, I wanted to craft a life that makes me happy and allows me to do things that bring me happiness.”Edwin Lee\u0027s experience echoes this. He interned at RBC Capital Markets before joining JP Morgan full time in 2006 in New York, and rising to the position of managing director. At the end of 2017 he resigned and joined a friend who was setting up his own company,\u0026nbspCastle Ridge Asset Management,\u0026nbspthat uses investment strategies informed by artificial intelligence.He tells The Independent that, particularly during his final few years at the Wall Street stalwart, work-life balance became “a serious issue”.“I ran the corporate trading desk which meant I was at work before the markets opened and didn\u0027t leave until the bankers were done,” he says. Lee often worked more than 15 hours a day and if calls weren\u0027t taking over his weekends and evenings then travel to London, Hong Kong and Tokyo often was. His wife had just given birth to their daughter and he felt like he was not seeing her grow up. “It had to change”.Of his current job he says that it was a “once in a lifetime opportunity” and that the autonomy was a considerable incentive. “It would be our team and our firm to build exactly as we like.”Already back in 2014, McGraw-Hill Education commissioned a survey of hundreds of US graduates which found that 73 per cent prioritised finding a job that they enjoy over one that pays well. And almost half of respondents said that they would favour a career that is beneficial to society.iStock)Lovell Corporation, a Canadian marketing company that focuses on connecting businesses with young professionals, published a research report in 2017 based on a survey of 2,000 young people, that found Generation Z – or those born between the mid-1990s and early 2000s – to be a generation of “change-makers”. These are the young people currently entering the workforce.The top career choice for that demographic in the survey was entrepreneur, with a large proportion also citing the not-for-profit sector as their top pick.“These statistics demonstrate the inclination of younger workers to seek meaningful work that fulfils their personal goals and creates impact,” the study concluded.Gian Power on meditation and motivation in the face of family tragedyOther studies have shown that the generation of people entering today\u0027s workforce is also more sensitive to issues around ersity and inclusion, and that those people are increasingly looking for a company that reflects those qualities.\u0026nbspScores of banks, professional service firms and consultancies are still marred by a reputation of being dominated by white men, and progress towards a more erse workforce is proving sluggish. Gender pay gaps are stubborn and that\u0027s spoiling the appetite of not just young women.Speaking recently at Goldman Sachs Asset Management\u0027s annual Future Leaders Conference, Ruwan Weerasekera, the chief operating officer at Softbank Investment Advisers, the manager of the massive Saudi-Japanese backed technology fund, said that almost everyone working at his company was previously at Deutsche Bank, UBS or Goldman Sachs.Softbank attracts talent, he said, by being erse, forward looking and representing an “intersection between finance and technology”. Many of the firms his company invests in are focused on social responsibility, which he says is also a big driver for a heterogeneous pool of potential hires, and is likely one of the reasons why his current employer is the only place he has worked where “white men are in the minority”.\u0026nbspDoing well by doing goodSo what are large institutions, like investment banks, doing to combat the start-up-driven brain drain? Kathleen Hughes, a partner at Goldman Sachs, tells The Independent that her firm has recognised and acknowledged the need for change to address the priorities of the next generation.“Around 60 per cent of Goldman Sachs\u0027 workforce is millennial and they have very particular values. As they start their career, they will value things like giving back and making an impact,” she says, adding that this is something Goldman has started tapping into.When Crystelle\u0026nbspPereira\u0026nbspfirst joined Goldman Sachs she felt like she was competing in \u0027both a marathon and a sprint\u0027In recent years, Goldman launched what it calls the Analyst Impact Fund which provides an annual opportunity for the most junior workers to pitch their cases to invest in non-profit organisations they deem to be most worthy. A sizeable grant from the firm is then allocated to the winning organisation. “Giving back is important,” says Hughes, “and that\u0027s what we\u0027re addressing.”Acknowledging issues around work-life-balance and presenteeism is also high up on Hughes\u0027 list of priorities. She says that technology has represented a sea-change for the better in that flexible working is now an integral part of company culture.And the initiatives seem to be resonating where it matters. Arianna Roccio, a recent graduate who has been at Goldman Sachs for three years, says that flexibility has evolved dramatically even in the short time that she has been at the company. “It\u0027s not really about face time in the way you might think,” she says.propsects to entice employees\u0026nbsp(Getty)Crystelle Pereira, another recent graduate who works at Goldman, says that when she first joined she felt like she was competing in “both a marathon and a sprint”. Since then, however, the dialogue between graduates and their managers has improved, “especially around the importance of balance and downtime”.Other banks have also implemented measures to sweeten career prospects for potential employees and tune into the zeitgeist.\u0026nbspChuck Teixeira, chief administrative officer and head of transformation at HSBC\u0027s global banking and markets ision, tells The Independent that his company has had to “completely change our approach”.Forget Brexit. We might be approaching another global recessionCould a no-deal Brexit hit the economy sooner than we think?Political tensions in Europe could lead to a serious economic slowdownHe says that they\u0027ve recently launched internship and graduate programmes, in which new professionals are introduced to careers in data science and engineering – areas not traditionally associated with banking.“To attract talent to these programmes, we have had to get on campus face-to-face, run meet-ups and hackathons where engineers and data scientists work together to rapidly prototype products,” he explains. “We realise that HSBC is not front-of-mind for these capabilities so we are reaching out to the global market and positioning ourselves differently, including targeting talent in other industries,” he adds.\u0026nbspFkexible working needs to be intergal to company culture (GettyiStock)Will Rocha-Thomas, who these days serves on his company\u0027s team that is responsible for hiring and retaining talent, is also encouraged by the progress. But he says that large firms still have their work cut out for them, and it\u0027s not always straightforward for the entrepreneurial start-ups either.Finally, he says that another simple thing that many large and small firms are still getting wrong, is that they are not taking action in response to feedback.\u0026nbsp“This sounds obvious but it’s a struggle for many big, centralised companies where making a simple change is a huge endeavour,” he says. “When people feel unhappy about something, and feel like there’s nothing they can do to change it – even if they give honest feedback – they generally quit,” he adds.Former JP Morgan managing director Edwin Lee agrees. While he admits that there are a lot of things\u0026nbsplarge institutions are able to do to improve the satisfaction and work-life balance of staff, the shift has to first occur in the fundamental, cultural DNA of the firm. Only then can practical changes be implemented. And that\u0027s where he sees the hurdle.He says that measures like paid leave, flexible working arrangements, sabbaticals or even mobility opportunities – that are frequently a given at start-ups and newer tech companies – are still often at odds with managers\u0027 immediate objectives. Those, in turn, often centre around short-term goals and the next earnings report.So perhaps the first step is to simply expand the horizon: teach managers that change happens gradually and that the long-term satisfaction of employees is as critical to the long-term health of the firm as the next quarter\u0027s profit is. Delving into the unknown is always scary, but once you\u0027re in, the opportunities might just surprise you positively.We’ll tell you what’s true.

What we are hearing is the biggest change in terms of trade this country has faced since the mid-19th century being imposed on this country with no consultation with business, no time to prepare,” she told the BBC’s Today programme.Theresa May has lost control of Brexit“This is no way to run a country. What we potentially are going to see is this imposition of new terms of trade at the same time as business is blocked out of its closest trading partner. This is a sledgehammer for our economy.”Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said abrupt changes to tariffs would be an “unwelcome shock” for businesses.“If the government were to bring these tariffs into effect on 30 March, the move would also have the potential to cede negotiating leverage in future trade talks.\u0026nbsp“While ministers have clearly listened to our arguments and maintained targeted protection in some areas, overall there has not been enough consultation, preparation or planning to support the firms and communities that could find themselves at the end of a sudden shift in tariffs. As MPs vote tonight, this is yet another reason why they must act to avoid a messy and disorderly exit from the EU on March 29.”The government also announced there would not be any new checks or controls on goods moving from the Irish Republic\u0026nbspto Northern Ireland.Garda in Ireland are concerned that\u0026nbspcould prove to be lucrative for potential smugglers and existing criminal networks in the country and across the border.Tariffs will apply to goods including beef, lamb, pork, poultry and some dairy products in an attempt to protect farmers but the NFU said this would not be enough.But Irish European affairs minister, Helen\u0026nbspMcEntee\u0026nbspsaid the move would be “absolutely disastrous for Irish agriculture”.NFU president Minette Batters said\u0026nbspit was appalling that farmers only now have the\u0026nbspopportunity to see tariff rates\u0026nbsp- a fortnight before they could come into effect.\u0026nbsp“Farmers and food businesses have no time to prepare for the implications, which will be exacerbated by the fact that we will face tariffs on our own exports on food into the EU and other countries with whom we currently enjoy free trade arrangements.\u0026nbsp“Although we are pleased to see that the government has listened to our concerns and elected to treat many agricultural sectors sensitively, which may support farmers who are already facing disastrous disruption from no-deal, it is enormously worrying that some sectors will not have this protection – noticeably eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables.\u0026nbsp“Even those sectors that are treated sensitively will, in most instances, see worrying and large reductions in the tariff rates currently charged on non-EU imports.\u0026nbsp“Furthermore, the approach taken by the government to lump products under the same high-level tariff code, for example whole carcases and high value cuts of fresh beef, means there is a high chance of market distortion for many sectors who are deemed to have been treated sensitively.”It comes after Theresa May lost a crunch vote on her Brexit deal in the Commons on Tuesday night.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The pound slipped to $1.30 and €1.16 after Mr Cox released his legal assessment ahead of an appearance in parliament.The falls more than erased previous gains made by the British currency on Monday after Ms May claimed to have secured “legally binding” assurances from the EU that that the backstop could not continue indefinitely.Sterling had rallied towards a 22-month high of\u0026nbsp€1.18 on Monday night,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspapproached the $1.33 mark against\u0026nbspthe dollar.But Mr Cox’s statement that the UK would still need EU agreement to be released from\u0026nbspthe backstop triggered\u0026nbspa sharp sell-off of the pound.In his official legal advice, Mr Cox wrote that if both sides deploy ”the necessary diligence, flexibility and goodwill” that both sides are now legally bound to show, it would be “highly unlikely” that the backstop would come into play. But he went on: “However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement.”The advice makes it extremely unlikely that Ms May’s Brexit deal will be voted through by MPs, and means leaving the EU with no deal would remain a possibility.Crashing out of the EU with no deal would likely cause a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the pound as investors become more pessimistic about the future of the UK economy.We’ll tell you what’s true.

I\u0027ve never seen him look better in my life. I\u0027ve never seen him happier. I\u0027ve never heard him play better, and the way the press would have it is he\u0027s a total destruction and ready to die. Totally not true.Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 313 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.413 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1313 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music.

Her allegations against him were false when they were made in 2016. They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms Heard and advance her career.Amber Heard was \u0027petrified\u0027 of Johnny Depp\u0027s \u0027other personality\u0027Johnny Depp dropped from The Invisible ManJohnny Depp sues ex-wife Amber Heard for $50m over \u0027hoax\u0027 abuse claimsHeard\u0027s lawyer Eric M George responded with the statement: This frivolous action is just the latest of Johnny Depp\u0027s repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard. She will not be silenced.The statement continued: Mr Depp\u0027s actions prove he is unable to accept the truth of his ongoing abusive behaviour. But while he appears hell-bent on achieving self-destruction, we will prevail in defeating this groundless lawsuit and ending the continued vile harassment of my client by Mr Depp and his legal team.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If you’re a creator of comic books featuring the adventures of super-powered, costumed heroes, that might be a difficult rule of thumb to apply. But perhaps not for Tom King. In Mister Miracle, from DC Comics, King and artist Mitch Gerads have created one of the most critically acclaimed graphic novels of the last year, and for the Washington-based writer, he drew on experiences that not a lot of other creators working in the field today have access to.King, 40, who was born in California, spent several years as a counter-terrorism officer for the CIA, working out in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s fascinating to think about what King saw and did, and how that later informed his writing. Obviously, I suggest, if he tells me too much about it he’ll have to kill me.\u0026nbspHe’s heard that one before, of course, probably more times than he can count. “No,” he says, with what feels like an oft-trodden out reply, “if I tell you too much about it, they’ll have to kill me.”Born to a film-writer mother in Southern California, King developed a love of storytelling and an understanding of narrative from an early age. During the 1990s he interned at the offices of the two big comics publishers, Marvel and DC. His ambition, though, was to become a lawyer\u0026nbspand he graduated from Columbia University in the year 2000, intending to follow this path. He started working for the Justice Department.And then came 11 September. Like everyone else in America, King was appalled and shocked and numbed. But he also knew he wanted to do something in response. So he went on to the CIA website and discovered that they were recruiting.“They were looking to bring in a new generation of operatives to serve in this new world,” he says. “They wanted people who were good at connecting the dots. I went in maybe hoping to get a job as an information guy, I took the psych tests, and ended up as an operations officer.”Created with Sketch.Mister Miracle: The critically acclaimed graphic novel in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photos by DC ComicsPhotos by DC ComicsKing worked out in the field in Afghanistan and Iraq for seven years, and the exact nature of his work out there is necessarily vague. When his wife fell pregnant with their first son (they have three children now) he knew he had a difficult decision to make.“The part of the job I loved was being overseas, out in the war zone, as bizarre as that might sound,” he says. “But I knew I didn’t want to do that and have a family. I didn’t want to be away from my wife and kid for a year at a time.”Returning to the US, King didn’t resume his plan to become a lawyer but instead turned to his first love, writing. But he wasn’t back in the world of comic books just yet… or at least, not quite. King wrote a prose novel, but about superheroes. A Once-Crowded Sky was published in 2012, to good notices. Writing about superheroes had regalvanised his love of comics\u0026nbspand opened the door for him to work at DC.His first gig was a series about Dick Grayson, the original Batman side-kick Robin who grew up and adopted a new persona, Nightwing. Co-written with Tim Seeley with art by Mikel Jannen, the series was the first time that King was able to draw on his CIA past, as the character quit the superhero business to become a spy.That led to more work, and to the series that first brought King to wider notice – and his first collaboration with Mitch Gerads, his Mister Miracle co-creator. Published in late 2015, The Sheriff of Babylon was a critically-acclaimed crime series about a San Diego cop who becomes a military consultant in Iraq\u0026nbspand has to solve the murder of a young local police trainee.More work followed, with King getting to write characters both classic and obscure, from Batman to the Omega Men for DC, and the Vision (the character played by Paul Bettany in The Avengers movies) for Marvel.Which led to King and Gerads working together again on what has become one of the most well-received comic books in recent years, earning plaudits from mainstream reviewers and publications especially… Mister Miracle.Mister Miracle is a character who was first introduced in 1971, created by the towering genius that was Jack Kirby for DC comics. Real name Scott Free (ouch. But it was the 1970s, and King and Gerads do a fine job of contextualising that), Mister Miracle is billed as a “super escape artist”, Houdini in a cape and mask and yellow, green and red livery. He’s always been one of those B-List characters, except to the most devoted fans, in terms of recognisability.But in an age where, thanks to the big comics companies mining their intellectual properties and breathing fresh life and mainstream appeal into characters formerly known only to the cognoscenti – s of the Galaxy, anyone? Ant-Man? Black Panther? Aquaman? Suicide Squad? – even the non-rabid comics fan seems more willing to accept stories featuring characters who aren’t Superman, Batman, Captain America or Spider-Man.DC cancels comic where Jesus learns from superhero after backlash Still, a super escape artist in a garish costume. Possibly limited scope there for anything beyond a series of set-piece daring feats, you might think. Which is possibly why Mister Miracle won so much praise by being one of the most literary and absorbing stories released by DC in some years.It opens with a shocking image… the titular character slumped on his bathroom floor, wrists cut and bleeding out over the tiles. Yes, it begins with a superhero attempting to commit suicide.“Scott Free can escape from anything,” says King. “So we thought… he’s going to keep pushing it, trying to escape from more and more difficult situations. And eventually he thinks, can I escape from death?”King and Gerads had wanted to work on another big series after the Sheriff of Babylon, and initially they pitched an idea for a Batman comic but focussing on two big villains, the Joker and the Riddler. However, the characters were already earmarked for a storyline in the main Batman comic, so it was vetoed. DC, however, threw them another option.Gerads says, “I got a call from Tom and he told me that we couldn’t do the Batman story. He said what would your second choice be, and straight away I said Mister Miracle.” Gerads pauses. “That’s absolutely true. And Tom said, well, that’s what they’ve offered us. And he sent me the pitch and the first line was, ‘Mister Miracle attempts suicide’.”Starting from that dark place, the story then expands out into an exploration of, really, the anxieties of living in the modern era. Scott Free is married to the unlikely-named Big Barda, and they are attempting to navigate the mores of family life in present-day Los Angeles. But Scott and Barda are also not of this Earth.Original Mister Miracle creator Jack Kirby dreamed up for DC comics in the 1970s a series of books that became known as the Fourth World, existing within the normal DC continuity of Batman and Wonder Woman, but also slightly apart from it. It focussed on two worlds, New Genesis, where the benevolent New Gods lived, and Apokolips, brutal realm of the tyrannical Darkseid. New Genesis and Apokolips are perpetually at war, and in a bid to broker peace, their rulers Darkseid and the Highfather agree to swap infant sons. Scott Free is the child of New Genesis, brought up in the hellish Apokolips, where he learns his craft and meets Barda, one of the fearsome Female Furies. Together they escape, and make a new life on Earth, but are called back into the war, which is where we find them in this story.Mister Miracle was originally released as a 12-issue monthly series, and has just now been collected into a single volume. But it was always meant to be read as a graphic novel. King says, “It’s like a Dickens novel, which were originally serialised. It’s meant to be read as one story.” He pauses. “Not that I’m comparing myself to Dickens, obviously.”The story is a mix of domestic life and the horrors of war. In one memorable scene, Scott and Barda fight their way over several pages through the terrors of Apokolips, holding a conversation as they do about redecorating their condo flat, building up to the tender moment – delivered as each character despatches bad guys in a sequence that looks like a platform video game – that Barda reveals she is pregnant.Mister Miracle is a very personal book for both King and Gerads. The sheer exhausting nature of war comes across in several scenes, obviously drawn from King’s experiences. And Gerads’ son was born right in the middle of him working on the series, adding extra dimension to the point where Barda gives birth.Gerads has also done artwork for Batman (DC Comics)It should be noted that comics are a very collaborative medium, and King and Gerads worked closely on the distinctive look of the story. The trend in comics these days is for big, break-out images, kaleidoscopic panels, imaginative layouts. With Mister Miracle, the team went for a nine-panel grid, most closely associated with the classic of the genre from 30 years ago, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ Watchmen.That’s perhaps informed the mainstream success of Mister Miracle. It might be an odd thing to say, but reading comics is a learned skill, and not everybody gets on with the medium. A strict page design allows for easier digesting of the narrative. Gerads says, “Some people in comics think doing a grid like this must be very constricting for the artist, but that’s not the case. The magic with this is that you know exactly how the reader is going to read your page.”King likens it to “almost like three Charlie Brown cartoons on each page, three panels each, and everybody knows how to read those”.Aside from being a meditation on war and a domestic drama with dialogue that would satisfy any Netflix drama binge-watcher, there’s also a bigger storyline at play in Mister Miracle. To wit, is any of it actually happening? Is it all, in fact, the dream of a superhero who’s lying on his bathroom floor, his life slowly ebbing away?“Living life is full of ambiguities,” says King, perhaps a little ambiguously himself.Gerads is more forthcoming, and points out that Scott Free is in every single scene in the story. “We never leave Scott’s side in the entire book, we go on this ride with Scott through the story. Perhaps by the end Scott realises that it doesn’t matter if it’s real or not, because one way or another this is what he’s lived through.”It was announced last year that one of DC’s next big movie projects will be based on the New Gods world, with Ava DuVernay (A Wrinkle In Time) lined up to direct. Rumours emerged in the last few weeks that Scott Free and Big Barda will actually form the central focus of the movie. Whether it will end up as an adaptation of this story, neither King nor Gerads could say, but if it does it could end up DC’s most interesting movie yet.King and Gerads are hatching another collaboration for DC, which they aren’t at liberty to discuss (though King drops the hint that there’s a clue within Mister Miracle as to what that might be) and in the meantime, King is writing for the publisher Heroes in Crisis, which deals with the post-traumatic stress disorder that could actually affect superheroes given the ongoing violence and battles they deal with on a daily basis.Does he find writing about the things he’s seen and experience during his time with the CIA cathartic? Or is it painful? Perhaps a bit of both, he says.“I think me writing about war has been more necessary than anything else,” he says. “War and the damage that war does has formed the basis for a lot of my work. I write to give my kids a better life and the best thing for me has been to draw on what I’ve done. But I think I might be ready to talk about something else, now.”Mister Miracle by Tom King and Mitch Gerads is out now and\u0026nbsppublished by DC Comics.We’ll tell you what’s true.

A charity encouraging education through photography is trying to change that, writes Will WorleyClick to followThe Independent‘I look at this place in a new way,’ says Victor, 12There is little expensive technology flaunted on the streets of Kibera, a slum in Nairobi, Kenya, often called the largest informal settlement in Africa.\u0026nbspSo it is a disorientating sight to see children gathering in the corner of a ramshackle bus terminal on the slum’s outskirts, clutching a disparate\u0026nbspcollection of flashy cameras, ranging from DSLRs to GoPros, as well as the occasional e-tablet.\u0026nbspThe children of this juxtaposed scene are students of the Inua Mimi Rescue Centre, a local space dedicated to caring for some of the most disadvantaged children in Kibera. The cameras they hold have been donated by iniduals and manufacturers, and are distributed among the kids by Photostart, a growing charity that aims to teach children life skills through photography.Children living in Kibera – and other sub-Saharan African slums – grow up in an environment tough beyond the comprehension of most westerners. While there is some local praise for the area’s erse community and lively atmosphere, poverty runs deep and many people live on less than a pound a day. There are few services, infrastructure is dire and planning is almost non-existent, particularly in the poorest area known as “Chocolate City”, after its muddy paths.Kenyan youth in general face significant challenges. Only 32 per cent\u0026nbsphave finished secondary school or have some vocational training, and there is little prospect of stable work – only 5 per cent\u0026nbspof Kenyan youth were in formal employment last year, according to research by Well Told Story, a development communications group. Circumstances are even tougher for those from Kibera, who say they are often tarnished by their association with the area, which has a reputation for crime and political violence.\u0026nbspHow one Kenyan woman escaped FGM and saved thousands more from the cutBut when its youth are given the chance and resources to prove themselves, they flourish. Photostart students have achieved far beyond what their society expected of them, and their pictures have won awards, featured in exhibitions in Nairobi’s most important cultural centres, and even been placed in The\u0026nbspNew York Times.The children’s starting point at the bus terminal is testament to the scale of their achievements. The Inua Mimi Rescue Centre, run by Shosho Pascalia Nduku for 19 years, is the closest many of its 128 children have had to a formal education. But it has been constantly beset by financial problems, meaning Shosho struggles to pay teachers and maintain the building.She gives The Independent a tour of the dilapidated classrooms, where some of the children with no other home also sleep. “My wish is God will help me find a bigger place,” she sighs. Seven classes are crammed into just three small rooms. The paint is faded and the furniture falling apart, and in one the only light is provided by a plastic drinks bottle protruding through a hole in the corrugated metal ceiling.Shosho\u0026nbspPascalia\u0026nbspNduku\u0026nbsphas run the Inua Mimi Rescue Centre for 19 years\u0026nbsp(Will Worley)“The kids are so good,” she says. “But to pay the teachers is a tricky thing, so they are always changing and they cannot be stable.”\u0026nbspThe centre has no regular sponsorship and running it is a constant struggle for Shosho, but she says it is “a dream God gave me”. When she first began her work, she says, she would sometimes find children’s bodies in piles of rubbish in the street.\u0026nbspShe houses orphans, their parents taken by HIV, who sleep\u0026nbspon rags on the floor in the centre. Some of the children lack birth documentation and don’t even officially exist, demonstrating how far removed they are from mainstream society.\u0026nbsp“I have so many kids who don’t have ID, I don’t know what to do,” says Shosho, “I talked to the government about it, but they say they are waiting for reports.”Sometimes, children with families fare little better, and Shosho says she occasionally sees children who have been sexually abused by brothers or fathers. It doesn’t take long for her to spot them, she says: “They come in the next day with a changed face.”\u0026nbspSexual and gender-based violence is a key challenge facing the youth of Kibera, according to Thomas Bwire, a local journalist who runs a community news website and focuses on health. He says: “Rape can happen within the family or in the close community. Students are also vulnerable when they go to school.”Shosho has mostly run the centre alone for the two decades it has existed, though a volunteer, Ann, is preparing spinach and potatoes for the children’s lunch during The Independent’s visit. “The way a child is behaving, you can tell if they have eaten or not,” says Shosho. “When a child is hungry, they can be sick.” Malnutrition is also known to have an impact on a child’s development and particularly educational attainment.Created with Sketch.From Cairo to Cape Town: In and out of Africa with National Geographic Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A ghostly Nuba glee club bathes in ashes to ward off evil spirits before singing at a sanda festivalKenyans trudging along a road battle clouds of ﬂying locusts.

He says this has a poor impact on their physical development and mental health. “Kids still want to play, but often they do it in ditches where there is sewage,” Bwire adds.Photostart, founded by an American, David Lehman, aims to further the children’s abilities and belief in themselves. In addition to teaching the children to use digital cameras and tablets, it also schools them in organisational skills like data entry and digital asset management – thus grounding them with an education in technology that is not available to them in their normal schooling. “There’s not much theory, lots of it is practical,” he says.\u0026nbspLehman, 35, also highlights “soft skills” Photostart encourages in the kids, like planning, preparedness, expression and building their self-confidence. It’s also key that the children are taken off the street, something Lehman reckons Photostart has done for roughly 20,000 hours across their projects in Kenya and South Africa. “If they are on the streets they are with the gangs,” he says.\u0026nbspOutside the rescue centre, the children, aged around eight into the early teens, are ready to venture into the slum. The group must wait for two young men who provide an informal security presence – their equipment is, after all, a valuable commodity.Photostart, a charity aiming to teach children life skills through photography\u0026nbsp(Will Worley)On their arrival, the children rapidly take to the streets with their cameras. Shosho, who has no classes today, joins the group as they make their way through the dust-red maze of paths that make up Kibera. As they leave their everyday lives behind them, the children’s spirits rise and excitedly, then more methodically, their view of their everyday environment alters as they document it through a lens.Dr Gil Pasternak, reader in social and political photographic cultures at De Montfort University, says photography encourages its practitioners to acquire a fresh perspective as it compels to\u0026nbspthem to go out into a new environment. “They need to make decisions: what to photograph, what angle to use, how to frame it, what to include, what to exclude,” he says.\u0026nbspThere are other benefits too. “The process of going out with camera can potentially make them aware of ersity and complexity,” Pasternak adds. “It can lead them to understand that information can be delivered in different ways and can also be manipulated.”He says this may help some children develop their critical thinking and lead them to question what is given to them as objective information and to explore further, possibly “developing their curiosity more broadly”.Lehman guides the children on the walkabout, pointing out when someone’s elbow is in the frame, or why the shutter won’t close (the timer’s on). “You can see progress in their work, especially older kids,” he says.\u0026nbspAs the children move deeper into Kibera, stray dogs, slumbering in the afternoon sun, suddenly find themselves models for an impromptu photo shoot. An open rubbish pit, smouldering and noxious, becomes the backdrop for portraits of friends posing together. Next to it lies the railway track which cuts through the slum as it links the coastal city of Mombasa to Uganda, and a view of Kibera’s expanse opens up.\u0026nbspThis railway was where Kibera began, when the British colonial government granted ethnic Nubian soldiers who served the empire land next to the tracks in the early 20th century. It used to be a wooded area – the name comes from the Nubian “Kibra”, meaning “forest”. The slum grew as more people, of all ethnic groups, migrated to the city, and the railway sustained economic activity.Inua Mimi Rescue Centre in Nairobi (Will Worley)But despite being a gateway to Nairobi for many Kenyans, Kibera has gained a reputation for political violence, which emerged along ethnic lines after elections in 2007. Election-related violence also swept through the slum in the aftermath of a disputed poll in 2017, and left its mark on the children living there.“The election was a challenge, people liked to fight,” says\u0026nbsp14-year-old orphan Abrut Wakesa, of the bloodshed, which led to the deaths of dozens people.Children often witnessed violence during this period and sometimes even subjected to it, according to Bwire, leaving them vulnerable to mental health problems. “But there are no trauma centres or counselling,” he says. “People can’t share what they saw. They are left to heal on their own.”As the children continue on their walkabout through the winding alleys and open sewage of Chocolate City, they become more animated. Objects of visual excitement, like a lone white rabbit which cautiously emerges from behind a fence, prompts a flurry of shutters.Shosho, who an hour before seemed to carry the weight of the world on her shoulders, laughs in between playing with a DSLR.“My heart is shining, I am the happiest woman,” she beams. “My kids really need this. They are the poorest of the poor.”Lehman says that an important part of the walkabouts he organises – with different groups across Nairobi – is to get the children “out of their heads and classrooms” for a little while, and to forget about their troubles.“Kids who were very shy, we now see brightness in them when we do this,” he says.Pasternak says the simple practice of being out with a camera may be conducive to improving confidence and other attributes in young photographers.\u0026nbsp“Being in a new environment, they will meet people out there, which means the photographer can learn about different perspectives, different values and different types of behaviours,” he says. “They might have not encountered these elsewhere.”\u0026nbspPasternak continues: “Encountering a range of iniduals and personalities can compel some children to learn how to talk with different types of people.\u0026nbsp“It can help them develop their expression skills and it can consequently help them develop new vocabulary, both verbal and emotional.”Pasternak adds that meeting new people and learning how best to deal with them can also “encourage them to empathise better and help them understand that not everybody is the same”.\u0026nbsp“All of these are transferable skills they can take to other areas in life,” he says.\u0026nbspWe ignore Islamist terrorism in Africa at our peril‘The city is very quiet’: Nairobi left reeling after latest attackCanadian among six suspects in court over Nairobi hotel attackNairobi attack a grim reminder of spectre of terrorism over KenyaThe “harder”\u0026nbspskills, such as inputting data into a spreadsheet, are turned into lessons that are “most assuredly shared with friend, neighbour or stranger”, says Lehman. Each walkabout is followed by a debrief, and older children often take responsibility for training younger students.\u0026nbspWhile the student’s pictures have been widely recognised within Kenya, perhaps their most valuable achievement is taking it upon themselves to share the benefits of their experiences.“Knowledge spreads fast,” Lehman says. “These students are anything but selfish about learning, they make sure their peers are keeping up, and relish showing off how much they have learned.”Locals have received the project well, and hope that it will both benefit more of their children and give the area a voice.“It’s a good platform for kids to do something different and a change in activity from the classroom,” says Jaymosh, a Kibera resident who works with another charity operating in the area. “There are a lot of untold stories in the slum.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The pound slipped to $1.30 and €1.16 after Mr Cox released his legal assessment ahead of an appearance in parliament.The falls more than erased previous gains made by the British currency on Monday after Ms May claimed to have secured “legally binding” assurances from the EU that that the backstop could not continue indefinitely.Sterling had rallied towards a 22-month high of\u0026nbsp€1.18 on Monday night,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspapproached the $1.33 mark against\u0026nbspthe dollar.But Mr Cox’s statement that the UK would still need EU agreement to be released from\u0026nbspthe backstop triggered\u0026nbspa sharp sell-off of the pound.In his official legal advice, Mr Cox wrote that if both sides deploy ”the necessary diligence, flexibility and goodwill” that both sides are now legally bound to show, it would be “highly unlikely” that the backstop would come into play. But he went on: “However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement.”The advice makes it extremely unlikely that Ms May’s Brexit deal will be voted through by MPs, and means leaving the EU with no deal would remain a possibility.Crashing out of the EU with no deal would likely cause a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the pound as investors become more pessimistic about the future of the UK economy.We’ll tell you what’s true.

If you see a video of a pool ball knocking into another one, for instance, and then reverse that same video, the physical processes would both make sense and it would be impossible at the level of physics to know which way around would be correct.But the universe does have one rule that goes only in one way: the second law of thermodynamics, which describes the progression from order to disorder.If you saw a video of someone breaking a perfectly arranged triangle of pool balls into a mess, for instance, then watching that backwards would obviously look nonsensical.The new experiment is like giving the pool table such a perfectly calculated kick that the balls rolled back into an orderly pyramid.The scientists found that, working with just two qubits, time reversal was achieved with a success rate of 85 per cent. When three qubits were involved more errors occurred, resulting in a 50 per cent success rate.The error rate is expected to drop as scientists improve the devices used to be more sophisticated, the researchers behind the discovery said.The experiment could have a practical application in the development of quantum computers, the scientists said.Our algorithm could be updated and used to test programmes written for quantum computers and eliminate noise and errors, said Dr Lesovik.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The discussion on Article 50, that is done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement, it is there. That is the question asked and we are waiting for the answer to that,” he told MEPs.Mr Barnier added that before the EU could make a decision on a further extension the UK would have to come up with a plan to build a “a constructive majority” in its own parliament.“It is the responsibility of the United Kingdom – they have to tell us what it is they want for our future relations, what will their choice be? That is the question that we need an answer to now.“That is the question that has to be answered before a decision, really, on a possible further extension.”Created with Sketch.Papers react to the Brexit vote Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch. highlights just how soon the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat has come Britain\u0027s scheduled date of departureThe Daily Mail takes aim at MPs who political editor Jason Groves claims have plunged Britain into chaos by rejecting the Prime Minister\u0027s dealThe Independent calls for a second referendum as a way forwardThe  leads with exasperation, with political editor Macer Hall writing that Brexit was hanging in the balance last nightThe Sun take the Prime Minister\u0027s croaky voice into account as it reports on last night\u0027s Brexit shamblesThe Financial Times claims that the Prime Minister\u0027s authority is in shreds and reports on the fall in the pound in the wake of the voteThe Daily  calls the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat humiliating and claims that a delay to Brexit is likelyThe i claims that parliament is out of controlThe Times claims that Britain is in crisis and that the Prime Minister may face resignation callsThe Daily Mirror says that the Prime Minister surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote  highlights just how soon the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat has come Britain\u0027s scheduled date of departureThe Daily Mail takes aim at MPs who political editor Jason Groves claims have plunged Britain into chaos by rejecting the Prime Minister\u0027s dealThe Independent calls for a second referendum as a way forwardThe  leads with exasperation, with political editor Macer Hall writing that Brexit was hanging in the balance last nightThe Sun take the Prime Minister\u0027s croaky voice into account as it reports on last night\u0027s Brexit shamblesThe Financial Times claims that the Prime Minister\u0027s authority is in shreds and reports on the fall in the pound in the wake of the voteThe Daily  calls the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat humiliating and claims that a delay to Brexit is likelyThe i claims that parliament is out of controlThe Times claims that Britain is in crisis and that the Prime Minister may face resignation callsThe Daily Mirror says that the Prime Minister surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote He was backed up by European Parliament Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt, who told MEPs:\u0026nbsp”I’m against every extension if it isn’t based on a clear opinion of the House of Commons for something they want. Please make up your minds in London, because this uncertainty can’t continue – not for us, not for Britain, and certainly not for our citizens.”\u0026nbspThe pair’s\u0026nbspcomments echo those made by French president Emmanuel Macron, who said his country would block an extension of Article 50 “without a clear objective”. He added that any delay had to be “justified by a new choice of the British”.There is little appetite in Brussels to keep kicking the can down the road, with views among EU diplomats mixed on the possibility of an Article 50 extension.\u0026nbspSome countries are more unconditionally open to one to avoid a no-deal Brexit, while others more keen to attach conditions.EU washes hands of Brexit deal: ‘We have done all that is possible’An extension would require a unanimous vote of the 27 remaining EU member states. Without their approval, Britain would crash out without a deal on 29 March 2019, unless it ratifies the withdrawal agreement or decides to revoke Article 50 completely.Brussels washed its hands of responsibility for trying to pass the Brexit deal late\u0026nbspon Tuesday after MPs\u0026nbsprejected the withdrawal agreement for the second time. A spokesperson for European Council president Donald Tusk said\u0026nbspthat the EU had “done all that is possible to reach an agreement”.“Given the additional assurances provided by the EU in December, January, and yesterday, it is difficult to see what more we can do. If there is a solution to the current impasse it can only be found in London,” he told reporters in Brussels.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Different countries hold their votes on slightly different days, as suits them.Why might the UK have to take part?The EU treaties are very clear: every EU member state has to hold European parliament elections, because the union’s citizens have an inalienable right to be represented at an EU level. If the UK hasn’t left by the end of May, it would still be an EU member state, and have to take part.The legal text of the Lisbon Treaty says that “in each member state, members of the European parliament shall be elected as representatives of the citizens of the union”. It’s pretty unambiguous.Couldn’t the UK just not hold the elections since we’re leaving?There isn’t any legal basis on which a member state could decide not to take part in elections – there’s no specific opt-out for countries undergoing Article 50.The general view is that there is no legal way for Britain to avoid the elections. The UK’s own Electoral Commission has set aside a contingency fund in case it needs to hold the elections, and it says it has “assumed that, should the elections go ahead in the UK, polling day would be Thursday 23 May”.Other member states including Belgium and Finland have also asked British nationals living in their territory to register – just in case they have to take place.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, agrees. He said himself in a letter on Tuesday: “I would like to stress that the United Kingdom’s withdrawal should be complete before the European elections that will take place between 23-26 March this year. If the United Kingdom has not left the European Union by then, it will be legally required to hold these elections, in line with the rights and obligations of all member states as set out in the treaties.”What would happen if the UK just didn’t take part and everyone turned a blind eye?The EU is based on rules, and those rules are governed by an independent court – the European Court of Justice. It would be extremely unlikely to turn a blind eye, especially if confronted with a legal challenge.Given the weight of legal evidence that Britain must take part – and our ided political system – there would almost certainly be a legal challenge. Even if nobody from the UK mounted a challenge, other groups across the EU could use the argument to challenge the results of the European elections.Given the European Commission is selected based on the results of the European elections, the consequences could be significant – undermining the mandate for the Commission to pass laws.\u0026nbspWhy does holding the elections cause complications?The UK’s seats in the European parliament have already been split up amongst the other member states, so it\u0026nbspreally needs to know whether Britain is taking part before the seats are allocated.If the UK left part-way through a parliamentary term there would also be the question of what to do with missing seats. Does the parliament just have a hole in it for just under five years until the next round of votes? Do the countries hold by-elections? Because different answers to these questions benefit different people, they will be difficult and isive to solve.\u0026nbspWhat’s the political backdrop to this?Aside from the practical reasons, there are also political reasons why the UK isn’t really wanted in these elections. The focus of this round of elections is expected to be stemming the tide of populism in Europe. Some polls suggest populist parties could win a third of seats.As one of the biggest member states, the UK returns a lot of MEPs\u0026nbsp– and it mostly returns them to the populist groups. Ukip\u0026nbspwon the 2014 elections in the UK and provides the bulk of members to the anti-EU EFFD group, while even the Conservatives sit in the hard-right ECR group, away from the European mainstream.Donald Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon has said he wants to unite populist forces across the EU, and British MEPs\u0026nbsp– who are also more Atlantacist than their continental cousins –\u0026nbspcould give him the numbers to make a go of it.Are British parties prepared for the elections?\u0026nbspSome parties, such as the Liberal Democrats and SNP, have already selected candidates lists, based on the possibility that there might be elections. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage has also set up a new Brexit party to stand in the elections and keep his platform in the European parliament – from where he attacks the EU and British government. Other parties – including Labour and the Tories – haven’t picked candidates – yet.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

It would create a fresh headache for the prime minister if selected, as it raises the prospect of a fresh defeat and possible resignations from Remain-backing ministers if they\u0026nbspare whipped to vote it down.Theresa May has lost control of BrexitIt comes after a day of high drama, where MPs defeated Ms May’s Brexit deal for the second time by 149 votes, despite last-minute assurances from Brussels over the\u0026nbspIrish backstop.After the defeat, Ms May\u0026nbspconfirmed she would allow Tory MPs\u0026nbspa free vote on a\u0026nbspmotion that would\u0026nbspsay parliament “declines to approve leaving the EU” without a Brexit deal on 29 March, and “notes that leaving without a deal remains the default in UK and EU law unless this house and the EU ratify an agreement”.Home Affairs Committee chair Yvette Cooper said the motion “sounded unclear” and said amendments would be necessary “to ensure that the vote can be clear-cut and that there can be no misunderstanding or misinterpretation”.Labour MP Owen Smith went further, adding: “The prime minister likes to pretend that she plays everything straight down the line, but tomorrow’s motion looks crooked as a corkscrew: we can vote down No Deal - but it’s still the default option if we don’t vote for hers!!“Parliamentary sovereignty is being crushed by Brexit.”\u0026nbspTory MP Tom Tughendhat said: The Looking Glass parliament. Today’s ‘vote’ to stop a no-deal Brexit can’t stop no-deal. The ‘debate’ won’t be a debate but the same people saying the same things they’ve said for decades.At least with no whip, at least we’re not pretending there’s a policy.Several other amendments have been tabled to the motion, including a fresh bid by Conservative MPs to revive the so-called Malthouse Compromise to strip the backstop from the deal.Tabled by MPs\u0026nbspfrom both Leave and Remain camps, this amendment would delay\u0026nbspBrexit day to May 22 to prepare to leave without a deal.It also urges the government to make\u0026nbspa standstill agreement with the EU and its member states, lasting up to the end of 2021,\u0026nbspduring which the UK would pay into EU budgets and observe legal obligations while a permanent relationship is negotiated.If MPs reject a no deal on Wednesday, as many expect, the third vote will follow on Thursday on whether to authorise Ms May to demand an extension of the two-year Article 50 process.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The Tories are giving their MPs a free vote on the issue, but Theresa May said during a Prime Minister\u0027s Questions clash with Jeremy Corbyn that she would be voting against no deal.Tariffs on most imports to be scrapped under no-deal Brexit, government saysNo Brexit is a bigger risk than no-deal, Stephen Barclay\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond set to deliver Spring Statement after PMQs\u0026nbspThe PM says the EU has made clear they will not accept elements of the withdrawal agreement, without an actual withdrawal agreement - such as a transitional period, or citizens\u0027 rights.\u0026nbspThis comes after a series of Brexiteer MP have suggested in recent days that Britain can pursue a so-called managed no deal , by leaving the EU on 29 March, without a deal, but with a transition period.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMichel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator, rubbished this suggestion yesterday, saying it was a dangerous illusion, adding: No withdrawal agreement means no transition.Ian Blackford - the SNP leader - says the government\u0027s own analysis shows a no-deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the economy and asks her to whip her MPs to vote against it this evening.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut Theresa May - as she has said on at least a dozen occasions previously - says the only way to take no deal off the table is to vote for a deal, or have no Brexit at all.\u0026nbspCorbyn says the reason the PMs deal is dead is because every step of the way she has refused to listen about the best way to protect job. When will she listen to concerned workers and business and accept the case there has to be a negotiated customs union, he asks.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMay replies hitting out at his stance on a referendum - and says despite shifting party policy, the Labour leader failed to mention it in his speech.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe says the deal he is proposing has been rejected several times by the House of Commons.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspI may not have my voice, but I do understand the voice of the country, she added.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Labour says this is a rudderless government in the face of a national government.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPrime Minister\u0027s Questions has now started. Theresa May kicks things off - and she is still evidently struggling with her voice.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe says she\u0027ll try to keep her answers shorter today.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn opens his first question saying the PM is not showing leadership by giving an MPs a free vote on no-deal, as he asks her how she will vote. She says she will be voting for the motion in her name - a short reply.\u0026nbspNational Farmers\u0027 Union president Minette Batters said it was appalling the import tariffs which will be applied in the event of no-deal had only been published a fortnight before they could be coming into effect.She welcomed the Government\u0027s move to treat many agricultural sectors sensitively but raised concerns over sectors which would not have such protection, such as eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables.\u0026nbspEven those sectors that are treated sensitively will, in most instances, see worrying and large reductions in the tariff rates currently charged on non-EU imports.\u0026nbspWe recognise the importance of ensuring food prices for consumers do not rise in a no-deal Brexit but we are deeply concerned that the approach to tariffs published today will mean a greater reliance on food produced overseas.\u0026nbspIreland\u0027s Europe Minister Helen McEntee reiterated that Ireland was not planning for a hard border on the island.She said people in Northern Ireland did not want the Withdrawal Agreement to be cast aside and ministers in the Republic were still not planning to allow the introduction of a physical border on the island.It is not something that we as a Government have been planning for, it is not something that we are thinking about and it is not something that we would allow.She said the UK and Ireland collectively had obligations as co-guarantors of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement to protect the peace process.Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u0027s\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspco-ordinator, called for the UK to put queen and country before party politics, appealing for certainty from the House of Commons.He told MEPs in Strasbourg: That is what we need and so I am against every extension, whether an extension of one day, one week, even 24 hours, if it\u0027s not based on a clear opinion of the House of Commons for something. That we know what they want.He added: Please make up your minds in London, because this uncertainty cannot continue. Not for us, not for Britain and certainly not for our citizens.We\u0027ve got a hectic day ahead of us, in what should be a momentous day in British politics -\u0026nbsphere is a breakdown of some of the major events that are happening today:\u0026nbsp12.00 - We have our weekly rendition of Prime Minister\u0027s\u0026nbspQuestions\u0026nbsp12.45\u0026nbsp- Once PMQs comes to an end, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, will be taking to the dispatch box to deliver the Spring Statement\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp14.30 - The motion on no-deal Brexit will be put forward, the vote could take place at any time after this, but we expect it will be around 19.00 (but this isn\u0027t confirmed!).\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMalthouse CompromiseTabled by a group of Conservative MPs drawn from both Leave and Remain wings of the party, this\u0026nbspamendment\u0026nbspcalls for a delay to Brexit day from March 29 to May 22 to give time for preparations to leave without a deal. It says the Government should then offer a standstill agreement with the EU and its member states, lasting up to the end of 2021 at the latest, during which the UK would pay into EU budgets and observe legal obligations while a permanent relationship is negotiated.\u0026nbspIndependent GroupBacked by all 11 former Labour and Tory MPs who defected to form The Independent Group, this would rule out no-deal under any circumstances and state the the Commons has the power to instruct the Prime Minister to request an extension of negotiations, revoke Article 50 or hold a second referendum. A second Independent Group\u0026nbspamendment\u0026nbspsimply rules out leaving without a Withdrawal Agreement or future relationship framework.Plaid CymruTabled by the Welsh nationalist party\u0027s four MPs, this would require the Government to extend Article 50 negotiations to 2021 and hold a referendum at the end of that period on leaving with a deal or remaining in the EU.Revoke Article 50\u0026nbspTabled by the Scottish National Party\u0027s Angus MacNeil and backed by europhile MPs including Tory grandee Kenneth Clarke, Labour\u0027s Keith Vaz and Plaid Cymru\u0027s Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts, this\u0026nbspamendment\u0026nbspcalls on the Government to halt Brexit by revoking its notice of intention to leave under Article 50 of the EU treaties.No no-deal everTabled by Midlands MPs Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey and backed by senior figures from all sides of the Commons including Sir Oliver Letwin, Hilary Benn, Nick Boles and Yvette Cooper, as well as all 11 members of the new Independent Group, this amendment simply rejects a no-deal Brexit at any time and under any circumstances.Speaker John Bercow will select a number of amendments\u0026nbspfor debate in the House of Commons tonight.The Prime Minister\u0027s motion states that the House declines to approve Brexit on March 29 in the absence of a Withdrawal Agreement or future relationship framework, but notes that no-deal remains the default unless both the UK and EU ratify an agreement.Here is a full list of the amendments on the order paper:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the liveblog to load\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

No 10 intends to whip against any amendments, but might now be forced to concede a further free vote or face a revolt by around 20 fiercely anti-no-deal ministers.* Any other problems?Yes.\u0026nbsp A further Tory amendment, dubbed ‘Malthouse Compromise B’, would dump the Brexit deal yet demand a transition period – despite the EU repeatedly ruling that out as a fantasy.At a cabinet meeting this morning, several ministers called for a free vote on that as well, with the threat of resignations from the Brexiteer side if they are whipped against it.* What time will the votes be?John Bercow will reveal which amendments he has selected mid-afternoon, with voting from 7pm – unless MPs demand more time, with the Spring Statement taking place first.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension and this house will have to answer that questionThere are cabinet ministers wanting to remove no deal as an option, like Amber Rudd, David Gauke, Greg Clark, and wanting to keep it on the table, like Liam Fox and Andrea Leadsom – leaving the prime minister no choice but to back away from whipping the vote.Acknowledging that she must now allow votes on outcomes she has vehemently excluded from her Brexit policy, she warned: “Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face.“The EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension and this house will have to answer that question. Does it wish to revoke Article 50? Does it want to hold a second referendum? Or does it want to leave with a deal, but not this deal?”In a croaking voice, reminiscent of her conference speech of 2017, she added: “These are unenviable choices. Thanks to the decision that the house has made this evening, they are choices that must now be faced.”It means MPs of all colours will be able to bring forward plans to try and direct the country’s next steps with Ms May bound to follow them if they gain a majority in the Commons.MPs cheer when Theresa May asks if they want another Brexit referendumOne group placed a motion on Wednesday’s vote to delay Brexit until 22 May\u0026nbspand then leave without a deal, backed by Tory Brexiteers Steve Baker, Jacob-Rees Mogg and Iain Duncan Smith, pro-EU Conservatives Nicky Morgan, Simon Hart and Damian Green and the DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds.Others are expected in coming days, including one from Labour backbencher Yvette Cooper and her Conservative allies Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles.It is expected that there could be a motion to rewrite legislation so that 29 March is no longer the UK’s legal date of exit, supporters of a new referendum are likely to table plans and there may also be a drive to push the UK towards remaining in a customs union with the EU.Mr Rees-Mogg, chair of the Brexit-backing European Research Group (ERG), warned those looking to delay the UK’s departure that it would not be easy to extend Article 50.“The default legal position remains, as the prime minister pointed out, that we still leave on 29 March,” he said.“It would have to be changed by law, and the law is not easy to change.”Pointing out that an extension would also require the permission of all 27 EU states, he added: “What is going to be asked for in this extension?”French president Emmanuel Macron has stated that for the EU to grant an extension he would want to see a change in Britain’s negotiating position, possibly pointing to a softer Brexit.France has also demanded better access to UK fishing waters in the past and Spain could ask for concessions relating to Gibraltar.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has warned any delay cannot stretch beyond 23 May unless the UK takes part in the European parliament elections starting on that date.Asked after the defeat in the Commons whether the government would consider bringing back Ms May’s deal for a further vote, the prime minister’s spokesman indicated it was possible, saying: “We have two votes coming up.

And he has consistently pointed out that the original dream that gave rise to it is under threat.It is exactly 30 years since Sir Tim submitted a paper to his colleagues at CERN, suggesting a way of sharing data across networks,\u0026nbspunder the title “Information Management: A Proposal”. The humble title belies the importance of what was contained inside, which included a complete sketch for the networked information system that would on to become the internet\u0026nbspwe know today.That would take some time, however. It would take a year-and-a-half for the name “WorldWideWeb” to be proposed, and it would take many months before the public could actually access a public version of the web even then, it didn’t look anything like the rudimentary graphical pages we associate with the early internet, let alone the huge and complex system you and your computer have navigated to get to this article.That modern web has brought with it a series of technologies that would have seemed impossible and unimaginable at the time the web was first being proposed:\u0026nbspinstant streaming of just about any film you would like to watch and\u0026nbspinternet connections inside of fridges. But it has also brought with it threats, some of which could undermine the very fabric of the web itself.In 2017, when the web turned 28, Sir Tim laid out what he saw as the three challenges that threatened it. All of them are at least as pressing then as they were two years ago, and some were eerily prescient about the ways the web would develop.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe first warning was that “we’ve lost control of our personal data”. He noted that many websites run on a business model that lets users have free content in exchange for their personal data, which allows them to harvest vast amounts of personal information, which in turn can make the internet a dangerous place to retain any kind of privacy or to discuss important but sensitive topics.Inventor of World Wide Web calls for crackdown on fake newsSince Sir Tim wrote that message, the world was rocked by the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a whole host of other revelations about the amount of data being collected on private people and how it is being used.The second challenge he noted was that it is “too easy for misinformation to spread on the web”. Noting that “most people find news and information on the web through just a handful of social media sites and search engines”, he described how websites spreading hoaxes, and false stories can do so relatively easily, and that the system can be gamed to spread that even more quickly.Third, he said that online political advertising “needs transparency and understanding”. Such advertising is become incredibly sophisticated, he noted, and when combined with the vast amount of data companies like Facebook are tracking can make it very easy to manipulate those people who see it.The scandal over political advertising in events such as the 2016 election and the Brexit vote is still continuing, and campaigners still criticise the relatively limited transparency that has been introduced on platforms that claim to be looking to limit it.A year later, in 2018, he shared another set of challenges, which largely related to the fact that the world has crossed over the point where more people use the web than don’t. That brings a whole host of questions of access and openness, he suggested.The threats that are posed to the web still very much exist, he noted. “But I remain committed to making sure the web is a free, open, creative space — for everyone,” he wrote last year.By closing the digital ide and helping people get online, stopping the control of the web lying with a small number of very big companies, and by making the discussion around the future of the web more erse, he claimed those threats could be avoided.Sir Tim has been consistent in arguing that the web is really a communal endeavour – and calling on that community to help save it from the threats it is facing.“I may have invented the web, but all of you have helped to create what it is today,” he wrote in 2017. “All the blogs, posts, tweets, photos, videos, applications, web pages and more represent the contributions of millions of you around the world building our online community.”That was a vision that was present in the original proposals for the world wide web, begun 30 years ago today. There, Sir Tim described a vision of CERN staff on the web\u0026nbspas “several thousand people, many of them very creative, all working toward common goals”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With a handful of exceptions, none are up to the job.Take Karen Bradley — absurdly over-promoted to Northern Ireland Secretary, yet cheerfully ignorant of the most basic issues there.Or grey bean-counter Philip Hammond, who wrecked No Deal preparations. Or timid David Gauke, or the destructively incompetent Chris Grayling.When rising Tory MP Johnny Mercer called for fresh Cabinet talent he meant himself. But he has a point. He, Kemi Badenoch, Tom Tugendhat, Tracey Crouch and James Cleverly — to name five — would do a far better job instantly.They have ideas, drive, an empathy with modern Britain and comparative youth. “We’ve selected too many of the wrong people over the last  years,” Mercer says. He’s not wrong.And a new crop couldn’t do worse.WHO’S to blame for the Brexit deal shambles  Almost everyone. But some MPs have at least behaved with honour.Our Government of Remainers negotiated ineptly. The EU, meanwhile, focused solely on ­forcing us to vote again. It has soured relations for a generation.Remainer MPs have been a disgrace, initially promising to respect the referendum then plotting to reverse it, openly colluding with Brussels against Britain.And next week comes the killer blow.Remainers from the Cabinet down will vote to end any chance of No Deal and to postpone Brexit, perhaps long enough for a second referendum — apparently unaware of the electoral catastropheThe rogue Speaker Bercow will help.Backbench Brexiteers, by contrast, stuck both to the logic of the Brexit result — leaving the single market, customs union and ECJ control — and the repeated promises politicians made toWe admire that.

We are almost there.”And he’s right.In the sneering words of ex-Whitehall panjandrum John Kerr, who devised the Hotel Calornia-style check-out-but-never-leave rules for Brexit, Britain has “come to heel”.Whatever emerges from the ashes of this week’s Commons votes, nothing can conceal the humiliation this country has suffered under Theresa May’s lock-jawed leadership.The PM has tarnished one of the jewels in the British crown — respect for this once-great nation in the eyes of the world.Thanks to her, a clutch of faceless EU bureaucrats and their feckless Tory allies have shredded the UK’s reputation for statesmanship and cool diplomacy. Great Britain — the world’s fth-largest economy, nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council — has been reduced to an object of international pity.Allies across the Commonwealth, America and even our erstwhile EU partnersare embarrassed to watch a great democracy grovelling before the unelected Burghers of Brussels.EvenAttorney General Geoffrey Cox s today with his famous cod-piece bulging, it’s lose-lose for Brexit.He might persuade enough Tory MPs to vote Mrs May’s botched and rebadged Chequers Deal through Parliament. But it will be at enormous cost.Barring an unlikely last- minute face-saver, Remainers have won this battle and the .million people who voted for Brexit have been comprehensively whipped.We can blame conspirators such as Tony Blair and ex-Chancellor George Osborne. We can point the finger at the BBC, Whitehall and a clutch of Cabinet plotters.We can blame the Brexiteers themselves for tripping over while stabbing each other in the back.And we can certainly blame Phil Hammond for blocking preparations for No Deal — our sole trump card in Brexit negotiations.But in the end, responsibility for this carnage lies with Mrs May. Indeed, thanks to her, Spreadsheet Phil can now bribe MPs with the £billion he saved by selling us down the river.If his chicanery succeeds, there is a remote chance Parliament will support Chequers and sign up to Brino — Brexit In Name Only. It will be a sour “victory”.History might be kind to Mrs May’s decency and her sense of public duty. But it will not ignore the catastrophic blunders which risk condemning this country to permanent vassal status.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt correctly warns Europe has just as much to lose. “This is a moment of change in our relationship between the UK and the EU and history will judge both sides very badlywe get this wrong,” he says.“We want to remain the best of friends. That means getting this agreement through in a way that doesn’t poison our relations for many years to come.”Stubborn as she is, Mrs May must know her days as PM are numbered.Losing three babies in quick succession is an unimaginable tragedy in any circumstances.In Shamima Begum’s case it underlines the recklessness of bringing children into the world of terrorist anarchy. Nothing Home Secretary Sajid Javid could have done in the few weeks since she emerged in public is likely to have saved her innocent child.The responsibility lies entirely with Shamima and her jihadi husband, Dutchman Yago Riedijk.There is no chance of her surviving what threatens to be disastrous spring council elections.Certainly there is no question of leading the Government into the next round of EU negotiations, still less risk another general election meltdown.Countless Tory supporters will risk letting Jeremy Corbyn in rather than vote for another May-led government.There is a deal to be had with pro-Brexit MPs who are threatening to inflict a final defeat on Chequers tomorrow.The consequences are unpredictable.If she promises to go by mid-summer, they will vote for her deal. If that works, she will at least be able to claim victory of a kind.It’s a long shot.

These include a fat embolism, when fat enters the bloodstream and blocks a blood vessel.In the lungs, for example, it blocks oxygen from entering the bloodstream, while in the brain it can cause a stroke – both can be fatal.Cheap overseas clinics are contributing to a rise in deaths from having the procedure, Prof Frame, a senior consultant surgeon at Springfield Hospital, Chelmsford, said.Last year a survey of  surgeons from across the world found  patients had died from a condition called a fat embolism - where the injected fat travels to other parts of the body that it shouldnt.Most of these deaths appear to have been caused by inappropriately qualied practitioners working in non-approved facilities, including homes and garages, he added.Other post-surgery problems, such as gangrene and sepsis, can also be fatal.Sarah Hemingway, representing Elite Aftercare at the inquest, told how the firm does not directly employ the surgeons themselves, and has no formal contract with the hospital involved in the surgery.But Mr Paige explained how the companys website claims to employ the best surgeons and nurses for procedures.The inquest also heard how Ms Cambridge had been asked to fill in a patient information anaesthesia form prior to travelling for the surgery, but no direct contact was made between Elite Aftercare and her GP.A provisional post-mortem examination had previously revealed that the mum died from a fat embolism caused by a cosmetic surgical procedure.It had been reported that the beautician had been paranoid about having excess stomach weight from having children, and opted for the butt lt procedure, which involves the reshaping of the buttocks by transferring fat from other areas including the stomach and back.Reports in the aftermath of her death told how Ms Cambridge had three heart attacks during the operation, which took place on August  last year.Patients make appointments at a UK office before travelling to Turkey for the surgery.The clinic’s website claims: “Elite Aftercare aims to provide a UK standard of care.”One reality star who had surgery there said last year: “It’s not a dodgy back street clinic.“I weighed up whether to have my nose job in the UK or over there and chose Turkey.“They’re constantly checking you’re all OK. They’re not going to discharge youthey don’t think you’re fit to leave the hospital. I was fine.”During Tuesdays hearing, the coroner suggested that a three-day inquest into her death would take place in early July, focusing on the contact between Ms Cambridge and Elite Aftercare, any pre-assessments done prior to the treatment, and the procedure itself.The controversial Brazilian butt lt, made famous by US reality TV star Kim Kardashian, involves taking fat from the waist or stomach and inserting it in the buttocks.The operation takes between one and two hours and involves a tiny cannula being inserted into a mm hole to extract fat.The fat is then puried and re-injected into the buttocks.According to Elite Aftercares website, Towie stars Lauren Goodger and Amber Dowding and Geordie Shore’s Chloe Ferry, have had procedures there.Former Spurs footballer Jamie OHara also had liposuction at the same Izmir clinic last year after piling on the pounds by scoffing junk food on Celebrity Big Brother."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000475362899.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dog snoop finds new home rspca","story":"Snoop the Staffie bull terrier was abandoned by the side of the road just before Christmas.CCTV images of him jumping up at his owner’s car window as it drove away in Stoke-on-Trent was watched by millions.And thousands, including US rapper Snoop Dogg, offered to re-home him.Mr Squire said: “I had a Staffie who I lost in November.

But given how much the web has changed in the past  years, it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can’t be changed for the better in the next .If we give up on building a better web now, then the web will not have failed us. We will have failed the web.To tackle any problem, we must clearly outline and understand it. I broadly see three sources of dys affecting today’s web:The second category requires us to redesign systems in a way that changes incentives.And the final category calls for research to understand existing systems and model possible new ones or tweak those we already have.You can’t just blame one government, one social network or the human spirit. Simplistic narratives risk exhausting our energy as we chase the symptoms of these problems instead of focusing on their root causes. To get this right we will need to come together as a global web community.At pivotal moments, generations before us have stepped up to work together for a better future. With the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, erse groups of people have been able to agree on essential principles.With the Law of the Sea and the Outer Space Treaty, we have preserved new frontiers for the common good.Now too, as the web reshapes our world, we have a responsibility to make sure it is recognised as a human right and built for the public good. This is why the Web Foundation is working with governments, companies and citizens to build a new Contract for the Web.This contract was launched in Lisbon, Portugal, at Web Summit, bringing together a group of people who agree we need to establish clear norms, laws and standards that underpin the web.Those who support it endorse its starting principles and together are working out the specic commit-ments in each area.No one group should do this alone, and all input will be appreciated. Governments, companies and citizens are all contributing, and we aim to have a result later this year.Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open. And they have a responsibility to protect people’s rights and freedoms online.We need open web champions within government — civil servants and elected officials who will take action when private sector interests threaten the public good and who will stand up to protect the open web.Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientic fact or public safety.Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, ersity and security in mind. This year we’ve seen a number of tech employees stand up and demand better business practices. We need to encourage that spirit.And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable for the commitments they make, and demand that both respect the web as a global community with citizens at its heart.If we don’t elect politicians who defend a free and open web,we don’t do our part to foster constructive, healthy conversations online,we continue to click consent without demanding our data rights be respected, we walk away from our responsibility to put these issues on the priority agenda of our governments.The fight for the web is one of the most important causes of our time. Today, half of the world is online. It is more urgent than ever to ensure the other half are not left behind offline, and that everyone contributes to a web that drives equality, opportunity and creativity.The Contract for the Web must not be a list of quick fixes but a process that signals a sht in how we understand our relationship with our online community.It must be clear enough to act as a guiding star for the way forward but flexible enough to adapt to the rapid pace of change in technology.It’s our journey from digital adolescence to a more mature, responsible and inclusive future.The web is for everyone and collectively we hold the power to change it. It won’t be easy. Butwe dream a little and work a lot, we can get the web we want. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

led by former Barack Obama adviser Jason Furman - ruled that the lack of regulation had allowed firms like Facebook to acquire the WhatsApp messaging  without any competition or scrutiny and had created an “unlevel playing field”.Treasury sources said Mr Hammond is keen to implement radical changes because it will force the likes of Facebook and Instagram to act swter on issues such as self-harm pictures because greater competition would allow their users to switch providers.The review also calls for the creation of a code of conduct and the strengthening of regulatory powers to tackle anti-competitive behaviour.Hard professor Jason Furman, who led the review, said: “The digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation.“Some say this is inevitable or even desirable.“I think the UK can do better.“The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, was right to recognise there is a better way than just continuing with the status quo.“My  is outlining a balanced proposal to give people more control over their data, give small businesses more of a chance to enter and thrive, and create more predictability for the large digital companies.“These recommendations will deliver an economic boost driven by UK tech start-ups and innovation that will give consumers greater choice and protection.”The review also recommends changes to merger rules so that the Competition and Markets Authorityis better equipped to stop mergers that are considered likely to damage future competition or consumer choice.In addition, it calls for the introduction of powers that would force large companies to open up to smaller firms by providing access to certain data, where doing so would not affect user privacy.It saidthe proposals were adopted it could help boost the economy by encouraging the development of new s alongside established names.In response, Mr Hammond said: “The UK leads the world in embracing technology and the opportunities it delivers for people.“Competition is fundamental to ensuring the market works in the interest of consumers, but we know some tech giants are still accumulating too much power, preventing smaller businesses from entering the market.“The work of Jason Furman and the expert  is invaluable in ensuring we’re at the forefront of delivering a competitive digital marketplace.“I will carefully examine the proposals put forward by the  before responding later this year, setting out how the Government will implement the changes needed to ensure our digital markets are competitive and consumers get the level of choice they deserve.”Damian Collins MP, chairman of the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sportselect committee also backed calls for tighter regulation.“I welcome the publication of Professor Furman and his expert ’s report on unlocking digital competition.“Its central conclusions that digital markets only work wellthey are supported with strong pro-competition policies, corroborates a number of the findings of my committee’s report into disinformation and ‘fake news’ published in February,” he said.“It is clear that a strong code of ethics is needed to regulate online s, and I agree with the report’s conclusion that the proposed code of competitive conduct is complementary with the code of ethics suggested by my committee.“We welcome the measures put forward to tackle anti-competitive practices and bullying tactics by market leaders.“This comes at a critical moment ahead of the beginnings of regulation from Government to rein in the powers of the tech companies.“I agree with the report that common data standards, including around the treatment of inferred data, should be set.“My committee was concerned by the treatment of inferred data by large tech companies such as Facebook, and it is essential that the Government acts to protect consumers.“The report is right to highlight that United Kingdom has the opportunity to lead by example in the area of digital regulation.“With a history of fair and robust regulation, and with the largest tech sector in Europe, the UK is uniquely placed to set world-leading standards in the digital arena.“Through the formation of the International Grand Committee it has already been demonstrated that other nations are ready to work with us to tackle the plethora of challenges presented by social media s.”Later this month, a government white paper on online harms is expected to be published, which is likely to include some proposals for new regulation on social media s and internet companies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was like a relic from a bygone era.She had survived through periods of terrible poaching and it was a victory that her le was not ended prematurely by a snare, bullet or poisoned arrow.Tragically, ruthless poachers prize elephants like F_MU precisely because of their impressive tusks.Ivory can fetch up to £, per pound on the black market due to demand in Asia - where it is used in an array of ancient medicines.The rarity of the super-tuskers made Wills task tracking her down all the more dficult - an effort he described as like looking for a needle in a haystack.He and wildle experts from the Tsavo Trust used a spotter plane to comb the area from the skies and relayed information to Will via radio as he crossed the dusty terrain in a car.But he remembers being awestruck when he first laid eyes on his subject.He wrote: If I hadnt looked upon her with my own eyes, I might not have believed that such an elephant could exist in our world.Will needed to use one of his BeetleCams - a remote-controlled buggy with a camera mounted on it - to capture the dramatic close-up shots.He added: She always proved to be the most exceptional subject.Her temperament was gentle and calm. Sometimes she would come so close to me that I could have touched her.The snaps - taken in August  and now being published for the first time in a new book - are the last documenting the stunning animal, who died shortly after amid a crippling drought in the area.Tsavo is home to the largest elephant population in Kenya and covers about , square miles.This makes it dficult to patrol - forcing conservationists to not make F_MU more widely known in case she attracted poachers.The photos feature in a larger book of incredible photographs taken by Will called Land Of Giants - documenting the wildle in Tsava and the work of the Tsavo Trust.It contains  previously unseen black-and-white photographs taken over three expeditions of two female big tuskers - one being F_Mu - and four males, including LU, the largest of all.Will added: Photographing F_Mu was a feeling of privilege and euphoria that will stay with me forever."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Poseidon-5.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"russia secret nuclear submarine revealed 2020","story":"The so-called Poseidon strategic missiles, carrying up to  megaton warheads, will be deployed by  and could wipe out the likes of Los Angeles, according to reports.Putins military plans to deploy the weapons on the new Project  sub Belgorod - a converted nuclear-powered submarine.Russias state-owned news agency Tass, citing a Moscow defence source, claims the underwater warships could carry six of the Poseidon torpedoes.In January, Fox News reported that a former senior adviser to President Trump admitting there are “genuine concerns” about the plan.Former State Department senior adviser Christian Whiton said a blast would create a “wave - and a highly irradiated one” but because the water would absorb a lot of the energy the wave would be less damaging than getting hit by the bomb itself.A prototype doomsday craft took to the waves for the first time on Christmas Day to begin under-sea trials, Tass news agency reported.A defence source is quoted as saying: In the sea area protected from a potential enemy’s reconnaissance means, the underwater trials of the nuclear propulsion unit of the Poseidon drone are under way.The drone is said to be powered by a miniaturised nuclear reactor, which has been fitted to the rear for ocean tests.Before Christmas it was expected that development of the weapon was at an early stage and the craft was being carried by one of the Russian navys nuclear submarines as part of experimental design work rather than full-fledged sea trials at this stage, the source told Tass.Vladimir Putin revealed the existence of the state-of-the-art new weapon earlier in , and claimed it would be able to whizz through the ocean almost silently at up to  knots.Putin said: It is really fantastic.

The House of Commons voted - against Theresa Mays plan - just  days after it suffered the biggest defeat in history.Understandably, people are feeling a range of emotions right now, with manly likely switching from confusion to frustration, and back again.And these feelings were perfectly encapsulated by a BBC host on television last night as she interviewed a  of MPs about what on earth is going to happen next for Britain. While grilling politician Barry Gardiner about Labours Brexit stance, Newsnight host Emily Maitlis dropped some seriously sassy side-eye.The -year-old asked the MP: If there is a general election called, which there is every likelihood could happen, what will be on your manesto  What Brexit vision will be on your manesto then  He replied: To negotiate the deal that we have set out. Maitlis couldnt stop herself from interrupting him, enquiring: Thats going to be on the leaflet   Gardiner continued: We will decide what our manesto position is as we normally do...At which point, Maitlis began shuffling her papers before glancing off to her right with a look of sheer exasperation on her face. She then began scrawling notes, which many viewers at home were desperate to have a glance at.   The MP added: It is a democratic party, as you know, it is not made up by one person on Newsnight as you know. Still seemingly unimpressed, Maitlis shot back: Well its not made up at all, people are literally pulling their hair out tonight. Following the heated exchange, the host was praised on social media for capturing the mood of the nation. One person tweeted: Emily Maitlis speaks for the nation.   Another commented: Emily Maitlis reaction here is PERFECT. A third added: Maitlis side-eye has knocked the planet off orbit. What a mood, wrote a fourth. However not everyone was impressed with the hosts behaviour, with some branding it unprofessional.  Speaking to Buzzfeed News, Maitlis joked that she hadnt been writing during the show but instead was crossing out all future dates and holiday plans.She later admitted that she had been making notes of what the guests were saying. She explained: When Im trying to process thoughts I write down what theyve just said so I can actually take it in and seeit makes sense to me.

There are now just days for Mrs May or Parliament to take control of the Brexit negotiation. In the coming days MPs will face a number of crunch votes. They will debate delaying Brexit andwe should rule out leaving with No Deal. The now very fluid situation could also see MPs rule out leaving the EU at all or agree to hold a second referendum. This is the guide for what could happen in the next few days as British politics enters its most unpredictable period in living memory.  MPs today will debate scrapping the chance of a no-deal Brexit. Under plans outlined by the Prime Minister on February , the Commons will have the option to vote on removing the possibility of the UK quitting the EU without an agreement. Theresa May controversially confirmed it will be a free vote to avoid a slew of Tory resignations. Businesses, experts and campaigners have repeatedly warned of a chaotic, economic doomsdayBritain was to plunge from the bloc minus a orce deal and transition period. Lorries could be stacked on roads leading to Channel ports, supermarket shelves may be emptied and vital medicine supplies might be disrupted, according to worst-case scenarios. But Theresa May has so far kept the option on the table, believing it is a key negotiating tactic. However, despite her desperation to preserve the possibility, there is no majority in Parliament for a no-deal departure.   If it comes to a vote tonight MPs are likely to deliver a resounding “No” to no-deal. Only a hardcore rump of Tories and some DUP MPs believe a no-deal - where the UK reverts to World Trade Organisation rules, raising the prospect of tarfs on a host of products - could be good for the country. Will Brexit be delayed  A vote on delaying Brexit is due to take place Thursday - and could finally dash the hopes of Leave supporters who were promised the UK would cease to be a member of the EU at pm on March . MPs are set to be given the chance to delay Article  - the formal mechanism for leaving the bloc - under plans unveiled in the Commons. The PM has always been adamant the UK will leave on March  - two years after formally triggering Article  - so any delay would be a severe humiliation. It would also fuel suspicions the UK will never leave - overturning the “will of the people”.   A short delay could happen regardless because evenMrs May manages to force through a deal at a third attempt, there maybe too little time left to pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through the Commons and Lords before scheduled departure day. The Government must table an amendable motion within seven sitting days of last night’s defeat - so by next Thursday. Experts say this means the PM will have lost control of the process, with Parliament in pole position to decide what happens next. However, the law of the land states the UK leaves the EU on March . That can only be stopped by changing the law - and time is running out. If the UK wants a delay, it has to ask for one from Brussels. The PM is due at a crunch summit in the city next Thursday where leaders could thrash out plans for a delay - or offer her another revision. The EU is likely to grant an extension of no more than two months - any longer, and the UK would be required to take part in EU Parliament elections. Will there be a general election  Mrs May is said to favour a general election over a second referendum, but neither option appeals to the premier. She is scarred by her disastrous  campaign where she was unable to resist a -point poll lead over Labour and triggered an unnecessary snap election, surrendering the Conservatives’ majority just two years after it was won by David Cameron. The PM’s “strong and stable” slogan backfired as Labour surged in the election day run-in, with Jeremy Corbyn resurrecting his leadership and performing much better than expected.   However, some polls in recent weeks have given the Tories a -point lead and Mrs May might fancy her chances of ballot box redemption. But the uncomfortable truth for the PM - and all MPs - is a new election could leave the parliamentary arithmetic largely unchanged: the Tories could still be the biggest party but wield no overall majority, and many Conservative MPs could still oppose Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement, The PM could find herself back at square one. Will there be a second referendum  Campaigners for another EU vote are biding their time before tabling an amendment demanding a re-run of the hugely isive  referendum. They want to exploit their “moment of maximum opportunity”, which may now be very near. Supporters of another vote claim voters should have the chance to back the PM’s deal or opt to Remain after all. But critics say the public has already decided to Leave, with ,, people backing Brexit and ,, wanting to stay in the EU - a majority of ,, to quit. Mrs May is dead against another EU referendum - and being forced to accept one may prove fatal to her premiership. Mr Corbyn has pledged to throw Labour’s weight behind a “People’s Vote”. But suspicions linger that he favours withdrawal - and the party leader continues to face anger over his apparent lack of enthusiasm for the EU during the  referendum campaign. Can May survive  Under normal circumstances, a PM who suffered a -vote defeat - the biggest ever in parliamentary history - on such an important motion as January’s meaningful vote would be expected to resign. But these are very far from normal times and Mrs May shrugged off the reverse and vowed to try again. Members of her own party tried and failed to oust her in December by tabling a vote of no confidence. She survived the vote by  votes to  - meaning more than third of her MPs wanted to topple her.   The victory - however hollow - meant Mrs May cannot face a fresh attempt to remove her as leader for another  months. In January, her Government survived a no-confidence vote by  votes to  after rebel Tory MPs and the DUP backed the Government just  hours after they combined to crush her original Brexit plan. Labour can table as many no-confidence votes as it likes, but Tories and the DUP are likely to continue to support Mrs Mays administration because they fear handing power to Mr Corbyn - and losing a confidence to vote would trigger a general election.

A second Independent Group amendment simply rules out leaving without a Withdrawal Agreement or future relationship framework. - Malthouse Compromise Tabled by a group of Conservative MPs drawn from both Leave and Remain wings of the party, this amendment calls for a delay to Brexit day from March  to May  to give time for preparations to leave without a deal.

A Brexit deal was agreed between the UK and the EU in November , but it was voted down twice in the House of Commons - first in January by  votes, then on March th by  votes. MPs are voting on Wednesday  March on whether to avoid a No Deal Brexit - and theyre widely expected to block it. But even so, no deal remains the default option and plans have long since been put into action, costing more than poundbillion, in case it happens. The government published  technical notices outlining the practical effects of No Deal - from driving licences to cats. And it unveiled new tarfs that would slap pound, on the cost of a family car from the EU - but leave % of goods imports, including steel, tarf free. This could threaten struggling UK industries with a flood of cheap imports.   Meanwhile ministers have , troops held at readiness, could call up Army reserves and declare martial law. Supermarkets and pharma giants are stockpiling food and medicine. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and troops couldto the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But businesses are not what whove written this guide for. Instead we have tried to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le.   What is a No Deal Brexit  No Deal is the default optionMPs, the EU and the UK government cant agree a Brexit Withdrawal Agreement by  March . The -page deal on the table would have ensured businesses arent cut off by continuing rules in a transition period until December . But it came at a cost - a backstop that could trap the UK in an EU customs union from . That means MPs have opposed it. Leaving with no deal will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . MPs believe they will block No Deal through Parliament - in a vote on Wednesday  March - butthey dont its still the default option at pm on March .   ways No Deal Brexit will hit you NOTE,  March : These scenarios are accurate as of early , when this piece was last updated. Some have since been partially resolved - for example, there is an agreement to ensure flights will continue. . Martial law could be imposed with thousands of troops on standby  More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Army reserves are also legally able to be called upthere is civil unrest, while councils are braced for possible runs on banks, fuel and food. Local Resilience Forums are reporting back to Whitehall and expect several months of disruptionthere is no deal. The government has plans in case it needs to impose martial law - military law - and curfews to restore order. Cabinet minister Matt Hancock admitted the plans existed but insisted the government was not specically looking at martial law and it was not the focus of our attention.  At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers to renew any passports older than nine years and six months. . Usually this means renewing six months before your passport expires. Butyour passport had more than  years validity, youll have to renew earlier, because the extra months on top of  years dont count. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  There is a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners must visit a vet at least four months before taking their pet the EU. And because talks are ongoing, that means youd better book in now. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\" The animal must have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts.  Food is being stockpiled forwe crash out of the EU without a deal, and ministers have promised an adequate supply. But thats not the same as having the range of food we do now. Leaked plans in December warned Brits could have to y their diet. And in January, big names KFC, Pret, Lidl, Co-Op, MS, Waitrose, Sainsburys, Asda and McDonalds signed a damning letter warning food supplies could run short because of disruptions to the supply chain. They wrote in a joint letter to MPs: Our ability to mitigate these risks is limited. As prudent businesses we are stockpiling where possible, but all frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK. They added: Retailers typically store no more than two weeks inventory and it becomes dficult to restock storesthe supply chain is disrupted.  A string of firms have either moved jobs out of the UK or are threatening to do so in a no-deal situation. Airbus, which employs , people in the UK with around , more jobs in supply chains, warned it may move where. Car plants are moving forward standard shutdowns to be around Brexit in case there are supply chain issues. And critics fear new investment will not come the UKs way, hitting jobs in generations to come.  Major motorways in the South of England are set for serious disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit. From early  the Mwill be closed as needed from junctions -, with a contraflow of both directions on the opposite side, so it can be used as a lorry parkthere is gridlock at Dover. A backup lorry park will be in place at Manston Airport. The M in Kent is also expected to be used as a holding area for lorries. And a similar fate could befall a -mile stretch of the M towards Southampton.  The International Air Transport Associationwarn up to million plane tickets could be cancelledthere is no deal. Currently it is not known exactly which tickets could be hit, or how passengers would find outthey are at risk. The situation arose because in a no deal, there will be no automatic legal basis for flights between the EU and UK after pm on  March . Under a pact struck between the UK and EU in December, basic connectivity will be maintained for a -month periodtheres No Deal. But according to the IATA - which represents  airlines including British Airways - that only means maintaining the number of flights in . It does not allow an increase in services - yet tickets have already been sold based on a predicted increase. Talks are ongoing, but Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, previously warned flights could be groundedgoodwill fails.  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you should get an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents were due to be sold at , post offices from February. Before they were sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Up to a million Brits may be forced to take a new driving test  British people driving in Europe could be forced to take a new driving testtheres a no deal Brexit. Up to a million Brits living in Europe were told to replace their driving licence with a local permit immediately. Guidance issued by the Department for Transport said: If you are aUKlicence holder living in theEUorEEAyou should exchange your UK driving licence for a local EU driving licence before  March . From that date, in the event that there is noEUExit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in theEU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there.  More than million EU citizens living in the UK will have less concrete rights to stay. Whether theres a Brexit deal or not, EU citizens can stay in Britainthey register for settled status with the government. But the rules are stricter in a No Deal Brexit. In No Deal, only EU citizens arriving before  March can apply, not those arriving by December . The deadline to apply will be  December , instead of  June there is a Brexit deal. And family members will only be able to join settled EU citizens in the UK before  March . As for the other way round - major EU nations have inidually said theyll allow UK ex-pats to stay, but this could y by country.  Pharmacists have requested special powers to ration medicinesthere is no Brexit deal. Under plans by the Healthcare Distribution Association, they would have special powers to y doctors prescriptions and offer something a drug is unavailable.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. Government and NHS chiefs have set up a war room called the Operational Response Centre and industry firms are creating six-week stockpiles of medicine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has chartered a plane to fly in short-shelf-le products, like isotopes for cancer treatment, from Maastricht. Insulin could also be stockpiled. Mr Hancock claimed hes become the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, after fitting out facilities for storage of the crucial drugs. NHS staff are being directed to urge patients not to stockpile medicines personally to avoid shortages throughout the system.  Mobile roaming charges face an immediate hikethere is a No Deal Brexit, the government has confirmed. Tory ministers are revoking the EU law which guarantees UK citizens pay the same for using their phone on the Continent as they do at home. That will leave mobile phone firms free to hike costs whenever they like after the UK leaves. Guaranteed free roaming launched across the EU just  months ago - and meant big savings. But that guarantee will be scrappedthere is no deal, thanks to an obscure law laid before Parliament.  Eurostar services could be suspended in a worst-case no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. The EU has agreed to keep permissions for services like the Channel Tunnel open for three monthsthere is No Deal, while a new agreement is negotiated. But there arent guarantees. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your everyday medicines and perfumes could become more expensive  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. And finally... your regular caviar parties are doomed!  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in endangered species that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use. A tragedy.

Now, five years on Lyndsey tells of her relief and the journey her brave daughter has been onShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI heard the word tumour and felt instantly terried. Whats wrong  What will her le be like  What happens next  - the questions kept coming. Jess had entered the world just hours before and we were overjoyed. It had been a tough few days, but our second daughter was finally here - a sister for our one-year-old Millie. But joy turned to such terrible worry and upset after those first newborn checks were carried out. Now, as we watch our bubbly little girl enjoying le in her colourful, cartoon eye-patch, were so proud of how shes taken everything in her stride. The operations - one for every year of her le - the endless hospital visits and perseverance with her superhero eye patch - shes breezed through it all.  My pregnancy with Jess had gone really smoothly. Scans at each stage showed there was nothing wrong and she was growing normally - we couldnt wait to meet her. But her tiny eyes were closed and we had no idea there was a problem. My waters broke five days before she was born and despite it being hard work, the birth was absolutely fine. Then, after just a few hours with our girl, alarm bells started to ring. The paediatrician came to the ward to carry out basic newborn checks on Jess. Everything was going well, until they looked at her eye. Theres no reflex in her right one doctors told us. They explained how after shining a torch into her eye, there wasnt the red glow a healthy eye gives when having a picture taken.  They said it could be a number of things, so we were sent for more check-ups on the neonatal ward. Then they mentioned a tumour. It was absolutely terrying - we thought about her future, the le we had planned her being a part of and desperately hoped for good news. We then went to the Manchester Eye Hospital, where a few days later they told us it was cataracts - a clouding over the lens of the eye. I felt pure relief at first - thinking of how easy it was to fix my dads cataracts - but I didnt know how dferent it was in a baby who had no developed eyesight. Jess then had her first operation at just six weeks old - and I was terried. Doctors explained how they would remove the lens of her right eye, but might not be able to fit an articial one as her eye was still too small. She was so tiny and saying goodbye to her as she went into surgery was gut-wrenching.  I was a bundle of nerves and couldnt go with her to theatre - I had to leave that to her dad. I knew she was in good hands with the doctors, but all I could do was wait for good news. And in a way, it came. They were able to remove the lens, but couldnt fit a new one. She was just too small and delicate. We were left with only one option- contact lenses, taken in and out of our tiny daughters eye every day. Along with the contact lens in her affected eye, we had to patch up her good eye to make the other work harder. The little sight Jess had, I was taking away from her - but I knew it was for her own good. Six weeks later, Jess had another operation to remove some remnants of the lens which had been left in and had started to mesh together. My girl wasnt even six-months-old and she had already seen the inside of an operating theatre twice. There was more to come.  After her cataracts operations, we were hit with another blow when she developed glaucoma - a potentially blinding condition. Jesss eyes soon began weeping a lot because her drainage channel wasnt letting enough water in and she needed two separate operations to widen it. We were still going with eye drops and patches, but it started to become really hard work when she got to the age of one. Jess was becoming more aware and started realising there were times without the eye patch, and times with it. And she made it perfectly clear what she preferred. She would constantly peel it off and wed go through about  a day - maybe more. It was a really dficult time and so draining on us - we were trying our best for Jess, but she was too young to understand.  As we desperately battled to keep her patch on and get her poorly eye stronger, we were faced with another stumbling block. Jess would constantly fall asleep when we covered her good eye. Being left with just the reduced sight in her left, she got bored and tired quickly and struggled to stay engaged. But we needed her to stay awake and strengthen the brain-to-eye connection. If we got a full  minutes with the patch on - wed see this as a win. We then started doing patch time, which basically involved doing anything to take her mind off wearing it. Wed play games or go out somewhere, and for a few amazing hours, shed forget about it. When Jess started pre-school, her daily routine also helped her understand when she had to keep it on. Jess has been absolutely amazing throughout the whole thing, and I think we found it harder than her at times. But when she started reception, it was the first time she started asking questions about why other children dont wear eye patches.  Thats when the Super Eye story started, helping my daughter make sense of what was happening to her, We told her she was so special, she was born with a Super Eye and she came to enjoy the colourful, sparkly patches she got to wear. Jesss latest surgery came in November last year, to fix a turn in her eye - known as a squint. We first noticed it at about  months old, but doctors told us to wait until her sight had sufficiently developed. It was a  degree turn in the eye, so quite noticeable. Why does my eye turn in and nobody s does  - It was the question that got me thinking it was time to get it looked at. Wed tell her it was her special Super Eye - but she was definitely becoming more aware of her condition compared to others around her. Her squint is much better, but weve been told she may need one more operation in the future to correct it even further. She also knows the patch will be a part of her le until shes eight.

One in three people in Britain believes that a house can be haunted and  per cent think they’ve experienced a ‘supernatural presence’, according to a YouGov survey. But a growing number of scientists now believe toxic mould - which grows on the walls of damp homes in the UK - could be to blame. It comes as Emma Marshall blamed a string of health problems on the black mould in her flat. The -year-old, who noticed the black mould at her flat in Hackney, east London, suffers from exhaustion, memory loss and her hair has been falling out in clumps.   Emma, who works in the music industry, has also suffered from brain fog, chronic nerve pain and skin rashes. She thought nothing of the “thick black mould” in the bathroom of her flat when she moved in in . But, since moving out the following year, her health has steadily declined. She is now hoping revolutionary treatment will help her expert symptoms. But experts claim the terrying hallucinations can be banished by simply scrubbing the mould off.  Ralitsa Prodanova of leading domestic services firm Fantastic Services said: “For eye-witnesses who experience supernatural encounters, the events can be extremely traumatic. “And when the paranormal activity is centred on your own home it can prove even more frightening. “But it’s important to remember that there could well be a rational, domestic explanation for all manner of spirits, poltergeists and demons. “Several studies have suggested the toxic black mould that grows on damp walls could be a factor. “These living, organic moulds can send spores - clumps of microscopic seeds - into the air, spreading like a virus.  “One of the worst-offending types - Stachybotrys chartarum - is present in many homes in the UK, and the mycotoxins it produces can cause respiratory problems, inflammation of the skin, tiredness and nausea. “Meanwhile some types of fungus - particularly the rye ergot fungus - have a psychedelic effect when ingested, causing hallucinations and delusions. “These moulds could well be behind many ghost sightings. And it’s important homeowners are aware of the dangers.” The phenomenon was first examined in  by experts in Maryland, USA, who christened it ‘Sick Building Syndrome’, or ‘SBS’, and documented the effects in the journal ‘Neurotoxicology and Teratology’. Lead author Ritchie Shoemaker analysed the inhabitants of water damaged, and mould-ridden buildings, and found patients had compromised ‘neurological ’, as well as a host of other toxicity-related ailments.  And in , a team of scientists from Clarkson University, New York, studied the links between hauntings and toxic mould. Associate Professor of Civil  Environmental Engineering Shane Rogers sampled the air quality in buildings associated with alleged ghost activity. He said: Hauntings are very widely reported phenomena that are not well-researched. “They are often reported in older-built structures that may also suffer poor air quality. “Similarly, some people have reported depression, anxiety and other effects from exposure to biological pollutants in indoor air. “We are trying to determine whether some reported hauntings may be linked to specic pollutants found in indoor air.”  He also added: “‘Although allergy and asthma symptoms and other physiological effects are well established, there has long been controversy over the effects of indoor mould exposure on cognitive and other ing of the brain.” American physicist and paranormal sceptic Dr Harry Kloor is also convinced mould is to blame for many supernatural events. He said: “A common airborne fungus will actually grow on latex paint and produces these ergot alkaloids which cause people to hallucinate. This could explain the bizarre things that people are seeing.” The NHS warns that, ‘ you have damp and mould in your home, youre more likely to have respiratory problems, respiratory infections, allergies or asthma.Damp and mould can also affect the immune system.’Some are worse affected than others, too, with babies and children, the elderly and those with existing problems, such as eczema or asthma, particularly susceptible. But thankfully there are methods to combat toxic black mould. Fantastic Services professional Ralitsa says: “If you’re attempting to clean black mould yourself, always wear a protective mask, rubber gloves and safety glasses. “And the most effective method of combating mould is to pour bleach into a spraying bottle, before covering mouldy areas and letting the bleach get to work for  minutes. “Open all windows to allow any toxic fumes to escape. “Then wipe and rinse the area and leave it to dry, before disposing of the cloth used.Bear in mind that bleach is a strong chemical product, which makes it dangerous for people with allergies, sensitive skin, as well as kids.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton reveals one place","story":"NewsKate Middleton reveals one place shes dying to take Prince GeorgeThe Duchess of Cambridge, who has three children, made the revelation on a trip to the National Portrait Gallery in LondonShareCommentsByJoe Gammie:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsKates got a cultural experience in mind for George \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Prince William and Kate Middleton arent short of places to take Prince George for a day out.The young royal has already been to some of the most luxurious places on earth and attends one of the countrys best schools.

When little Lilliana Blackburn was born via emergency c-section on August  last year weighing a healthy lbs oz, doctors and nurses were amazed by her full head of dark brown hair. Parents Anna Pendowska, , and Lee Blackburn, , from Basingstoke, Hants, said their little bundle of joy is constantly compared to Agnes, the youngest of the three sisters in the animated Despicable Me films, who wears her hair in a large ponytail on top of her head. The couple now spend two to three hours a week styling and washing Lillianas hair and have to buy special shampoos and products to tame her locks - but say the tot has grown to love a blow dry with the sound of the hairdryer even sending her off to sleep.  Anna, a cafe manager who is currently on maternity leave, said: When Lilliana was born, the doctor said she had the most hair he had ever seen. We were rushed for a c-section because they were having trouble getting her out and the first thing that the doctor sad was I can see hair. All the nurses were commenting too, and couldnt believe it. People often say she looks like Agnes from the Despicable Me films. We wash it every day, especially now that she started weaning and she loves touching her hair whether her hands are clean or dirty. But I blow dry it every second day to avoid damaging it too much. People do stop us when they see her, especially in shopping malls and coffee shops. People tend to whisper look at that babys hair.Despite the myth that mothers carrying babies with more hair have an increased amount of heartburn , Anna said she had a straight forward pregnancy with no heartburn.  She believes her daughter gets her luscious looks from her mother, as she was also born with an incredible amount of hair. After a -hour labour, Anna was rushed into theatre for an emergency c-section at Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital, and the couple were overjoyed to meet their new little one. Anna, originally from Poland, said: Lilliana gets the hair from me as I was the same when I was born, she gets her lovely blue eyes from her dad. She is very advanced for her age. As soon as she was born she was trying to hold her head up and was sat up at four months old, I dont think it will be longer before she is talking or even standing. When she was born I had to go out and buy a bigger hair brush as the little baby one just didnt cut it, plus shampoos and conditioners to try and tame it. When she wakes up in the morning she looks like Elvis, her hair is all over the place and she looks like she has a quf.   She loves the hairdryer and we find it really soothes her. It even sends her to sleep sometimes as she likes the noise. Anna and Lee, who works as a foundry manager, have recently entered Lilliana into a beautul baby competition and hope her abundance of hair could help her win the top prize - the chance to be on the May cover of Baby Magazine and a year-long modelling contract.

John McDonald harboured the twisted fantasies and trawled the internet for indecent images of children, Teesside Crown Court heard. The -year-old paedophile, who has learning dficulties, reported his disturbing thoughts to the authorities, later saying: I cant stop. Yet no work at all has been done with him, said the one-time playgroup workers barrister Stephen Constantine, reports Teesside Live. He was jailed for three years in November  for a molesting a very young schoolboy and asking the boy to touch him. He admitted sexually assaulting a child under , inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and possessing more than  indecent and prohibited images of children and extreme pornographic images.   He had volunteered at a local playgroup, though his crimes were not connected to it. He was released in December , but was recalled back to prison three months later after he made a worrying confession to probation. Prosecutor Harry Hadfield said: He disclosed that he fantasised about snatching a five-year-old child from the street, taking them to a derelict house and raping them. McDonald also said he had identied a derelict train track and fantasised about taking a child from Asda in South Bank then raping them and ultimately strangling that child to death. He was kept in custody until his sentence expired in June . McDonald told his offender manager he felt he could trust himself with a tablet computer he had been given as a present. But he got flustered when the detective asked to inspect his laptop in an unannounced visit on November  last year. He said: Ive been watching porn. I dont want mum to know. The officer checked the tablet and found websites known to carry prohibited cartoon images of child abuse, some referencing The Simpsons. There were numerous sites referring to incest and searches suggesting a sexual attraction to children among more than , pages in his web history.   McDonald cried, saying: I cant help myself. I cant stop. I need help. He asked the officerthey could delete it all and forget about it, make it go away, promising he would not do it again. He confessed he made the searches for sexual gratication and was pleasuring himself five to  times a day. A large number of cookies had been deleted, flouting a sexual harm prevention orderwhich banned him from deleting his internet history, putting him in the dock again this week. McDonald, of Warwick Street, Ayresome, Middlesbrough, admitted breaching the indefinite SHPO. Mr Constantine, defending, said: He doesnt want to spend the rest of his le in custody. He wants to get some help in removing those desires. He clearly has some awareness of the risk that he poses. Its not disputed that he himself reported his concerns to probation which resulted in his recall. He has reported further concerns to the authorities which resulted in a meeting at Roseberry Park hospital. He does clearly need some assistance. He said McDonald had a learning disability and had been deemed unsuitable for a sex offender treatment programme. The sad truth of the matter is that since his conviction, now some four years ago, no work at all has been done with him, added Mr Constantine. This is despite a number of occasions where he has clearly sought some help. A probation officer said the latest breach was not an escalation in McDonalds offending as it did not involve contact with a child. Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, noted McDonald had reported his own violent thoughts towards young children.

The second woman caught the superbug after having more than one sexual encounter with British men while on holiday on the Balearic island. The cases, first reported in January, are linked through a common sexual network have increased fears that super gonorrhoea could spread through Europe.   Health bosses are urging people to practice safe sex to prevent the spread of the disease, and tell their sexual partners of any existing sexually transmitted infections . Both women have since been cured. Researchers said the spread “was based around exposure in Ibiza. They added: The common link is people who are having unprotected sex on holiday. UK health bosses have alerted their counterparts across Europe.  Dr Nick Phin, Deputy Director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, said: Two women were treated for extensively drug resistant gonorrhoea in the autumn of . These cases serve as a reminder of the importance of protecting yourself against sexually transmitted infections. This includes using condoms consistently and correctly with all new and casual sexual partners. In March last year, it emerged a British man had caught the worlds worst ever case of gonorrhoea after a sexual encounter with a woman in South East Asia. Public Health England said it was the first time the infection could not be cured with first choice antibiotics. Gonorrhoea is the second most common bacterial STI in the UK after chlamydia. Most cases affect young men and women under . What is super gonorrhoea   Super gonorrhoea is resistant to the antibiotics used to treat a normal case of the disease. Gonorrhoea is an STI caused by bacteria called Neisseria gonorrhoeae or gonococcus. It used to be known as the clap. Gonorrhoea is easily passed through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex, or sharing vibrators or sex toys that have not been washed or covered with a new condom each time theyre used. It is usually treated with a single antibiotic injection and a single antibiotic tablet. Most symptoms - such as a thick green or yellow discharge from the vagina or penis, pain when urinating and, in women, bleeding between periods - improve within a few days. About one in two women and one in ten men will not experience any symptoms. The NHS warns the bacteria can infect the entrance to the womb , the tube that passes urine out of the body , the rectum and, less commonly, the throat or eyes. It adds: The infection can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby. Ifyoure pregnant and may have gonorrhoea, its important to get tested andtreated beforeyour baby is born. Without treatment, gonorrhoea cancause permanent blindness in a newborn baby.

They engaged her in conversation and then manually restrained her [through the fencing] to prevent her from jumping, states the report. Two unormed Durham Constabulary officers arrived at the scene a short while later. The police officers also engaged the woman in conversation and used handcuffs to secure her to the viaduct bridge. The woman agreed to climb back over the fencing on to the bridge. However, as one of the officers removed the handcuffs to assist her in climbing back over, she fell from the viaduct – falling from a considerable height to the ground below.

Two-year-old Jordan never had enough room to lie down and get a decent nights sleep so standing up became his normal. The poodle was filmed with his head bowed and rocking from side to side next to an unused dog bed by foster mum Melissa Lentz last week. Confused Melissa was concerned the pup named Jordan Knight, in tribute to the New Kids on the Block crooner, was ill but soon realised he was trying to nap. Dog food distributor Melissa believes Jordan didnt know how to sleep lying down due to the chronic over-crowding at the puppy farm he was rescued from.   The -year-old was left in tears as she realised that the hell hole conditions hed grown up in meant he had always been forced to stand and didnt know what a bed was for. Melisssa, from Roswell, Georgia, in the US, said: I didnt realise what he was doing at first - his head was bowed and he was rocking which I thought was strange. It took me a minute and then I realised oh my god hes sleeping like that while standing next to a dog bed. It broke me to see him like that. I see so much neglect and abuse as awful as it sounds you can get immune to it. This brought tears to my eyes, I didnt expect that at all.   She added: He was found in hell hole conditions in over-crowded crates and was covered in urine and dog faeces as they had nowhere  to go. Because of the filth, the cold and the over-crowding I dont think he ever wanted to lie down so didnt know how to. After filming the short clip Melissa tried to reassure Jordan he was safe and encourage him to snuggle down in the cosy bed she had for him. Despite Melissas gentle approach the poor pooch was too terried to be around her and ran off to be alone. Melissa said: That night he was so scared of me he scarpered off and I didnt want to scare him anymore. I tried to show him how to lay down and gently pushed his legs but he was too scared. As much as I wanted him to lay down I didnt want to frighten him.   Melissa, who has fostered more than  dogs in eight years, said that Jordan loves the company of other dogs and is slowly starting to get used to being around humans. Mum-of-one Melissa said: His tail is wagging more since we rescued him last week. He loves other dogs and is now laying down to sleep - thats how he learned to lay down from copying them. He hadnt ever walked on grass before, didnt know what a step was and how to climb up it before coming here and now hes managed to tackle that. Hes learning how to be a dog and its so heartwarming to see. I have tears of joy every day watching his achievements. Melissa, who has volunteered at Releash Atlanta since , said although heartbreaking at times fostering dogs is a gratying experience.  Melissa said: Fostering is so rewarding. I got my first foster dog, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, when he was five years old.He wouldnt come out of his crate for months but when he did, and achieved other tiny victories, it was amazing.The animals we take in are either sick, matted, scared or any combination of that.To see them blossom from a sick petried sick dog to the happy dog thats going to be a great member of a family is so heartwarming.

But apparently theres a way we can make our tea ever tastier, and its actually less work. According The Jockey Clubs etiquette expert Neil Phillips most of us are making a key mistake when stirring. We dont know about you, but we leave the tea to brew, add the milk and sugar then stir in a circle a few times. Wrong. Apparently we should be stirring in straight lines from the top to the bottom of the top of your mug rather than around the cup.   Speaking to , he explains: It is about going from six to  very gently. If youre adding sugar it will allow it to dissolve properly. If you just stir it it will all fall to the bottom. You don’t need to do it for long, just a few goes. It just allows the tea and milk to blend together. So there you go! Neil also shared some other tips when we caught up with him ahead of this years Cheltenham Festival.   When it comes to brewing time, Neil says lots of us dont leave those lovely leaves for long enough. He says: I like to brew my teas for four to five minutes. Its personal preference, some people will just wait a couple of minutes. It is about us taking a bit more time but with that extra time you’re going to have a dference experience. Away from tea, hes also explained the correct way to hold a white wine glass. You should also hold the glass by the stem, rather by the main bowl.  In fact, thats why wine glasses are actually designed with the stem rather than just a normal rounded bowl. The same rule appliesyou’re drinking champagne or prosecco from a flute. You should also hold the glass this way when youre pouring your favourite drink from the bottle.

People clamour to get on the guest list but there is only space for , people - and The Candyman has come up with a very unusual way of deciding who will be getting in. He has teamed up with Celebrity Ink to brand fans around the world with a real tattoo of his Candy Shop Mansion logo.   The tattoo is then their ticket to VIP access to his next huge house party in December. And Travers claims , people from countries including Australia, Indonesia, India and Thailand have confirmed they will be getting the tattoos. The businessman said: Its only taken  years to create the best party on the planet. When you think of the Candmay party, you think next level - then double it. A Candyman party is a place to be free and live out your wildest fantasies without any judgement.   The only problem with my party is that my bed only sleeps nine girls.

He arrived on a floating stage on the river behind his -bedroom orgy mansion.   It has been reported the lavish bash cost more than one million Australian dollars. Travers, who is famed for his polyamorous le, said: What I’m like in business, le or sport, I’m like that in bed.They love my imagination and creativity. You need that when you’ve got multiple girls.”Married to Taesha the couple have two children.  Travers, , told : When I was a teenager I wanted  children, but six will do now, I would be happy with two more boys. Taesha texted me today actually, and can I read this out  She said, I really want a baby boy with you....like now.

Taesha, a former body building champion, said that she actually instigated their infamous polyamorous lestyle, not Travers.  Taesha speaking previously to : When I was younger I was into girls. I was curious and I kissed girls but it never went further than that. Our first few years of married le were normal. We had children, we got married, but I would text him pictures of girls and ask himhe liked them or point out girls when we were out. One night, the couple decided to invite another girl into their company and their bed has rarely been empty since. Four women - and just one man - sleep there on an average night while at parties, naked bodies tend to spill out onto the floor, the couple said.  I like girls the way Travers does so it works for us both, Taesha said. The couple met when Taesha was just  but their  year age gap has not proved a barrier to their enduring love, they said. An agent first invited Taesha to one of Travers Candyman parties but she turned down the offer. When she was later recruited to work at a Candyman party, she refused two roles - as a rollerskater and a cloakroom attendant - but she eventually agreed to be a hostess.  And when she met Travers there she said it was love at first sight. I had Googled him before and I thought he was really hot but when I met him I froze. He was the most drop-dead gorgeous thing I had ever seen. He had glasses on and when he took them off he had the most amazing green eyes. It was instantly love for me. But he takes his parties very seriously. He just said hello and was very business like. He was not sleazy at all and clearly respected all the girls which impressed me. We didnt get together that night but we were destined to be together because we kept crossing paths. We always saw each other on a track we both exercised on. I was with my mum the first time we met there and I was too shy to speak. But then we bumped into each other at a club. He told me I had a really fat ass and gestured at it.I couldnt really hear him so I went right over to him and he told me I had a really big ass again. He offered to help me with my modelling portfolio and we just really clicked. The couple quickly had daughter, Velicia, now , and found their dream house - the Candyman Mansion - where they now live and throw their elaborate parties.  Taesha said: We had desperately wanted the house and when we were moving in we went for a celebratory dinner in a restaurant we had wanted to go to for a while. He started telling me I love you. Youre the mother of my children, and all these sweet things. Then he took out a ring, got down on one knee and asked me to marry him in front of the whole restaurant. I said yes Ill marry you.

Speaking for the first time from behind the bars of a court cage she told reporters that Moscow investigators suspect her of “beating the child and risking her le by neglect. The horric conditions in which Lyubov was found have deeply shocked Russians with Vladimir Putin’s children’s ombudsman Anna Kuznetsova personally visiting the girl in hospital to hug her. On the state of her home - so bad that rescuers wore chemical protection equipment when they entered it - the mother insisted: “It cannot be true.”   Garashchenko insisted she raised her daughter in “good conditions” adding: “I do not know what happened in the flat.” However she admitted: “The investigator told me allegedly I was driving my daughter towards suicide, that I was beating her. “But Im her mum, I gave birth to her, to my first child, when I was . “And for five-and-a-half years I fed her, raised her. “Of course I love her. I would never leave her.” Garashchenko told Le news outlet: So far I cannot understand what has happened in the flat and I want to find out by myself.  “I was not let in and Im not allowed to see my daughter. “So I do not know what happened in the flat. “I was detained nearby.” She claimed someone had staged a “provocation” to mess up her apartment. The mother said she had been absent a few hours but neighbours believe she had left the child home alone for some days. Lyubovs incessant crying alerted them and they called police.   I have raised this child for five and a half years and do everything for her,” she told NTV, denying any wrongdoing. The mother has claimed to work for an energy company and in financial services. “I earn money, pay for everything, maintain her, feed her and so on, Garashchenko said. “She was in a good condition…” Garashchenko added that her daughter did not go to nursery school as she was educating Lyubov herself. She said: “She can communicate, she can speak. “I worry like every mother. “I want to see her, hug and kiss her.  “She is my child. I will fight for my daughter.” But neighbours say they had not seen the girl since she was a baby, when she was healthy. There were claims Lyubov was hidden from the world and had a necklace ingrowing into her neck - now removed by doctors. The mother once had an obsession with cleanliness, sweeping public areas in the block of flats, said neighbours. “She loved cleanliness, often washed the floor near her door and and the elevator,” said one. Chief doctor Ismail Osmanov who is caring for Lyubov said: Unfortunately she does not speak.   “She pronounces only separate syllables. “At the same time, she has no physiological disorders. “Such a developmental lag is due to the fact that no-one was engaged with the child.” Lyubov can point to her eyes, nose and mouth, he said but she is unfamiliar with sleeping in a bed.

Particularly against Inverness last week, they seemed to be able to keep United at arms’all too easily.I think that had a lot to do with the tempo of their play, which was not high enough.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr teen yob admonished after","story":"NewsAyr teen yob admonished after kicking dogThe offence occurred in Ayr’s Dalmilling Road on May  last year.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsThe boy appeared at Ayr Sherf Court \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA -year-old who kicked a dog ended up in the dock at Ayr Sherf Court.

Let’s face it, stories about a Mr Paine and some broken glass usually appear on April . But no – it really was only March ! Mr Paine’s issue is the emptying of his street’s bottle bins at am. On the morning of his first collection, he mistook the noise of breaking glass for a robber breaking into his house. “I was terried,” he said. And then added, “This is noise pollution and most of the street must have been up.” Well, I too have suffered Mr Paine’s ‘noise pollution’ - perhaps an even noisier version. Chez Shields is no stranger to a well chilled Petit Chablis washing down the foie gras before Eastenders. In fact, I’ve been known to pop a second cork just to recover from Eastenders! Based on Mr Paine’s video recording, the noise made by the emptying of my bottle bin is right up there - somewhere between a small public house and a decent sized restaurant. Andit wakes up my neighbours – I couldn’t give a Chateau Le Clos! On my street’s first collection, I didn’t wake up thinking I was being burgled. House-breakers don’t usually make enough noise to get “most of the street up”. I seem to remember thinking, “That’ll be the bin men . . .” and going back to sleep. And on the  days a year that the glass bins are emptied in “quiet, residential Masonhill”, I respectfully suggest Mr Paine does the same. After all, we’re talking about saving the world here . . . not saving an hour’s kip! Greenhouse gas emissions are asphyxiating the planet. Plastic bags are strangling dolphins and milk bottle caps are choking sea birds. Our little Earth is throttling itself. To be honest, I’d rather be concentrating on ten decades of industrial pollution than Mr Paine’s ten minutes of noise pollution. And meanwhile, still in bin land, South Ayrshire Council is blaming the public for the latest waste collection problems. I can see the point they’re making – but the word “contamination” is a bit strong for Mrs McGuffie putting Tiddle’s empty Whiskas can in the paper and cardboard bin. And the new recycling system is a little too new for the “red tag” bin police to be targeting offenders. By refusing to lt certain bins – South Ayrshire Council is tempting fate. I’ve heard reports of some people using a neighbour’s bin when their own bin is full and red tagged. I’m also told there are increasing incidences of household waste being stuffed in the street bins reserved for pedestrian litter. And stuck in the middle are the bin men themselves. One told me “If we red tag a bin – we get **** from the householder. If we take back a contaminated bin, we get **** from our supervisors. Basically, were in the **** no matter what we do!” My dear old mum used to use a lovely phrase – “There’s a place for everything . . . .and everything in its place”. That’s exactly how SAC’s new recycling system meant to work. But it’s going to take a little time and a little patience – on both sides. The info leaflets sent out to explain the new system were largely ignored or discarded - most people didn’t understand them. But with the new bins now rolled out – a back-up leaflet might help. “You’ve got your new bins – now here’s how to use them”. Rubbishing the new rubbish system isn’t going to make it go away. It’s here – let’s get on with making it work for ourselves, our neighbours and our community.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironment"},{"url":null,"title":"churches facing end era parish","story":"NewsChurches facing end of era as parish minister calls it a dayCrisis in Kirk conregationsShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email There’s no parish ministers round here, writes Edwin LawrenceThat’s the crisis facing Kirk congregations in Girvan and South Carrick. And it becomes reality with the imminent departure of Rev Richard Moffat from Girvan North Parish Church. The area – in the short term at least – will be dependent on the services of elderly retired ministers and lay readers. Mr Moffat has been a popular parish minister at Girvan North for five years. And he was due to become Moderator of the Presbytery of Ayr in April. But he is set to move to a new charge in Morayshire, to be closer to his daughter and her family. He will conduct his last Sunday service in Girvan North on March . Mr Moffat’s departure is the latest factor concentrating minds in the Church of Scotland. For Girvan South, linked with Barr and Dailly is currently without its minister. Popular Rev Ian McLachlan has been on sick leave for several months. And colleagues say he is unlikely toto full-time duties. Rev Stephen Ogston was parish minister at Ballantrae Colmonell from  until August, . But he moved on to Luce Valley Church, and no replacement has been found. The linked charge of Ballantrae St Colmon also takes in services at Barrhill and Glenapp. So communities right across Girvan and South Carrick no longer have a parish minister in their midst. And there is uncertaintly at how things will be resolved. One solution might be a union of the two Girvan churches. And that could leave Girvan North - with its -foot spire – as the last kirk in town. It would presumably also be used as a hub to minister to village churches. The Post understands there can be as few as six worshippers in Barr Parish Church on Sundays. This isn’t helped by Barr being last in the pecking order for services, after Girvan South and Dailly. So it’s virtually lunchtime before a Sunday service gets under way. A Presbytery of Ayr meeting was due in the Carrick Centre in Maybole on Tuesday this week.And the Post understands this will see Rev Ian Stirling Fisherton Kirkoswald appointed interim moderator at Girvan North. Locum minister will be retired minister Rev Edgar Ogston – father of Stephen – who livesin Girvan.The Post has spoken to kirk elders in Girvan who say they’re uncertain about the future. And a retired church minister suspects that the two Girvan churches will be required to amalgamate. He said: “Things are changing. We’ve been a clergy-centred church for  years. “But one positive thing we’re seeing is the rise of worship groups which are prompting people to think about their faith, without necessarily being preached at.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandAyrMoffatGirvan"},{"url":null,"title":"crumbs cocktails bar boss hails","story":"Owner Ashley Nicholson, pictured front right pictured with staff member Kirk Burns, front left, with customers.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA bar boss has hailed heroic punters who chased an alleged gunman from her pub.

Ashley, , said: “It was horrendous but our customers’ reaction says a lot about not just our bar, but Ayr in general. “It’s easy to get down about the town at the moment with Hourstons closing and one thing or another. “Maybe it takes something like this to show how people can pull together when you need them.” Ashley’s popular haunt was the subject of an attempted raid last Monday night. It followed the bar’s busy quiz night when an alleged gunman struck about .pm. Around  punters had been in the bar shortly before.

The -year-old was accused of being in possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear or violence. He was also charged with using a firearm to resist arrest when he appeared at Ayr Sherf Court.

The South of Scotland Tory MSP says he is hearing growing concerns from villagers about the condition of the site. He said: “Since the landfill closed its gates, worries have been expressed about smells and also about contaminated water running off the site.” These would normally be dealt with by the site owner, so Mr Whittle took up the issue with both the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand the Scottish Government. However, in the absence of a clear answer on ultimate responsibility, he decided to raise it at Holyrood, during First Minister’s questions. In response, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:   “I am not able to give that information to Brian Whittle right now. “I undertake to raise the issue with the environment secretary and to come back to Brian Whittle as quickly as possible about our understanding of the lines of accountability and the action that the Scottish Government can take to try to reach a resolution of what certainly seems to be a deeply unsatisfactory situation. “I can understand that people in the local area will be very concerned about any prospect of contamination and it is absolutely necessary that all relevant agencies and organisations respond as quickly as possible.” Speaking afterwards, Brian Whittle MSP said: “The situation with the Tarbolton Landfill has been allowed to drag on for too long already. “Aside from the obvious concerns local residents have, it’s troubling that there doesn’t appear to be a clearly defined process for when the operator of a site like this is no longer able to carry out their duties to protect the surrounding environment. “I hope the First Minister will be able to provide some much needed clarity on this issue.” "},{"url":null,"title":"holiday beach made rubble","story":"NewsThe holiday beach made of rubbleSilver strand is lined with brickShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsNo sand castles - but they can be made from brick.

After his first two space launch attempts ended in failure, it is no surprise that Elon Musk#s SpaceX recently took a dummy to the International Space Station.Solo ocean crossings in a sailing boat are another example of a sport that seems too risky to many.Free Solo tells of Honnold#s perfectionism but ultimately he relies on  practice, friction, magnesium carbonate chalk for his sweaty palms and his wits.Throughout the ascent, and the preamble which leads to it, including romance and his girlfriend#s struggle #to understand#, Honnold is filmed by his friends, some of whom cannot bear to watch the final solo.Extreme solo feats have existed as long as humans. The marathon developed in Ancient Greece as a solo running challenge and people still die in the st century emulating those barefoot warriors.Climbing and mountaineering has a long history of solo risk taking and many of its protagonists live relatively short lives.Some though, such as legendary Italian Walter Bonatti, were hard wired for solitary ascents.

Assuming Wednesdays vote happens as the Prime Minister promises, and parliament votes against a no deal, that should be the end of their dreams of a ldquoclean break WTO Brexit in two weeks. MPs surely have the power to prevent such an outcome. On Thursday,there hasnt been an election called, MPs should vote also for an extension of Article , and therefore put a brake on the UKs departure from the European Union.Since no one in their right mind believes there is any point in just having another three months of this neurotic indecision, the extension would have to be long enough for the UK to have a general election and come to some consensus on what leaving the EU means. Or whether to leave it at all. That would surely take a year at least. Probably two.Read more:Humiliated Theresa May suffers second Commons defeat as MPs reject Brexit dealThis would mean the UK paying many billions for the privilege of remaining, and having to elect MEPs to the European Parliament in May. That is a legal requirement for member states, and the UK would of course remain a full member of the EU pro tem. Such might be the sense of frustration and disillusion with Brexit, which is demonstrably a result of its advocates being unable to decide what it means, that this extension might turn into something rather more permanent.My own view is that it would probably lead to Britain parking itself in the European Economic Area ndash the so called Norway option. This means the UK would be out of the political institutions of the EU, and the Common Agricultural Policy, but remaining in the European Single Market. This is an unsatisfactory compromise, since the UK loses its voting rights in the Council of Ministers, but it is undoubtedly Brexit. It has been good enough for Norway since , and it may be the only compromise that works.But at this moment, in the backwash of todays astonishing events, rational thinking on Britains future relations with Europe is pretty well impossible. The government cannot govern, parliament cannot choose and Britains political parties are disintegrating. The Tory Party is irrevocably split in all but name, and Labour already has.It was left to the Attorney General, Sir Geoffrey Cox, to drive the last nail into the Prime Ministers coffin with his legal advice on her latest ldquobreakthrough. It was ldquobollocks he said ndash at least that was his Tweeted censure to the Channel  presenter Jon Snow, whod suggested that Sir Geoffrey had been bounced into changing his legal advice on the backstop. In fact, Cox hadnt changed his advice ndash at least not materially. His statement concluded that the UK, even under Mays new deal, could be trapped indefinitely in the customs union backstop, albeit that the risk of this had been reduced. If Brussels behaved in bad faith, Britain could legally cry foul.The Brexit Select Committee tried to make sense of this and ended up resorting to metaphysical speculation about the meaning of ldquobad faith. This is an existential question, essentially, and one that the philosopher Jean Paul Sartre wrestled with all his le. The Brexit Secretary, Stephen Barclay, who is no Sartre, said that Britain could claim bad faiththere was ldquounjustiable delay beyond the agreed timescale for negotiating the future trading relationship. This is supposed to be completed by December . But since no one ever took that date seriously, delaying beyond it could hardly be bad faith.Anyway, by definition the European Union always conducts its negotiations in good faith. If there is still no technical solution to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, how would a delay in the expiry of the backstop be in ldquobad faith. The benchmark is surely the Good Friday Agreement and the British governments commitment to it. If the only way of honouring that is for the UK to remain in a customs union and in regulatory alignment with the Single Market, then surely ldquogood faith would indicate that the backstop should be permanent..bc-player-iAIgYhFQ_default .vjs-tech .bc-player-iAIgYhFQ_default .vjs-playlist-description .vjs-big-play-button .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist .vjs-playlist cite .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time cite.vjs-playlist-name .story-credits #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description .vjs-playlist-thumbnail  * Style the overlay *  * Hide the overlay * -countdown display: none-overlay display: none * Style the overlay * .vjs-overlay,.vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top position: absolutetop: pxleft: px.vjs-overlay p width: pxbackground-color: #color: #fffpadding: pxpadding-left: px !importantmargin: margin-left:  !importantmargin-bottom: border-radius: pxtext-align: left.popout-player position: relativewidth: pxmargin-bottom: pxtransition-property: alltransition-duration: mstransition-timing-: ease-in-out.bc-outer position: relative.bc-inner left: %top: %transform: translateposition: absolutewidth: pxheight: pxcolor: blackdisplay: blockbackground-color: whiteopacity: .font-family: VideoJStext-align: center.bc-inner:hover cursor: pointeropacity: ..bc-inner-font font-size: px width\"%\"data-account\"\"data-player\"iAIgYhFQ\"data-embed\"default\"data-popout\"\"data-autoplay\"\"data-multimedia-block\"\"data-video-id\"\"class\"video-js\"playsinlinedata-random-id\"\" mutedcontrolsTheresa May had made two fatal mistakes.

The semi-retired earl, whose Lever Bros business would go on to form part of giant Unilever, believed the croftersrsquo outmoded way of le needed a visionary like him to revolutionise their communities.He believed a mechanised fishing industry with ice factory, canning and processing plants to feed his UK-wide network of businesses could end the back-breaking task of toiling the land and allow crofts to merge to create single, sprawling farms, boosting his fortunes in the process.ldquoThere was a strong aspect of late Victorian paternalism, of people in poverty and seeing the crofting way of le as a very backward one, adds Mr Robertson.ldquoHe thought these were impoverished people in need of being improved. He didnrsquot see any benefit in crofting and thought what Lewis and Harris needed were more large farms ndash dairy farms in particular ndash and that the people should go to work on the farms or in his fish processing and canning factory.Resistance came, in particular, from young men home from the First World War. Angry at having been initially promised crofts on their , they drew inspiration from the rebellious actions of the Red Clydesiders and organised themselves in military-style groups.Together they marched on crofts that Leverhulmersquos farms had swamped, and carried out a series of land grabs to take them back. Sixteen of Lord Leverhulmersquos  Lewis farms were affected, while his threat to evict the crofters drew little public or political sympathy.ldquoLeverhulme didnrsquot understand the crofts and cotters. They didnrsquot want what he was offering, it was incompatible with their lives, says Mr Robertson, a lecturer at the University of Highlands and Islands.ldquoTherersquos a Gaelic word lsquoduthcashrsquo an amalgam of a sense of heritage and a fundamental belief in common rights. They believed they had a right to inherit land ndash even land they didnrsquot own.A showdown between Lord Leverhulme and croftersrsquo representatives symbolised the yawning gap between the two.The episode is marked today by the Gress Raiders Memorial. Eventually, Lord Leverhulme gave in and switched focus to Harris, where a small fortune was ploughed into creating his modern vision in the fishing port of Obbe ndash hastily renamed Leverburgh. He died in .But the episode prompted Parliament to pass rethink croftersrsquo rights and passed the Land Settlement Scotland Act , which gave government the right to remove land from private ownership and deliver it to the people.Today, it is accompanied by more recent ldquoright to buy legislation that gives communities, such as recently happened in Ulva, the chance to push for landowners to sell land to them.Mr Robertson said: ldquoLeverhulme wanted to completely reorganise how the land was worked on Lewis and Harris.

We have been sharing information to help the sector prepare for that scenario.#However, Mr Carmichael is standing by his claims, saying behind the scenes analysis is a totally dferent level of depth than the full impact assessment expected to be done on such a massive change.He has branded conservative ministers #woefully irresponsible# for #failing to safeguard the sector from the impact of Brexit.#Speaking while making his claims, earlier in the week, prior to the response from DEFRA, Mr Carmichael said: #When Conservatives think of farmers, they think of the big landowners and the estates This [FOI] response shows that they have no interest in, or concern for, the hill farmers and crofters whose businesses are the backbone of so many of our remote rural communities.#To run their business, farmers need certainty. They need to know what funding is available, what standards must be met and what tarfs need to be paid.#It is therefore appalling that Conservative ministers have failed to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of Brexit on sheep farming. These ministers are woefully irresponsible. Farmers deserve better.#“Behind the scenes analysis falls well short of the in-depth impact assessment that farmers and crofters deserve. It is like not doing your homework, but trying to cover the fact by saying that you put together a mind map. Simply unacceptable. By the government’s own admission, they have done nothing, and know of no work to do an impact assessment on the industry.“They have let the industry, and our farming and crofting communities down.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s interesting because, no matter where I go, these are the three predominant issues, and they are all related.”There are around  EIS members in Orkney.On Monday, EIS members voted to reject a new pay offer.According to Mr Ramsey, the next step will be to hold a ballot on industrial action, although the union remains open to further negotiation.“Assuming that our members decide to vote for a strike, there will be two or three weeks before that goes through,” the vice-president explained.“We intend to continue to negotiate. We realise that teachers don’t want to strike — they do not do this lightly. We have even made a decision not to strike during the SQA exams.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mrs May confirmed she would ask Brussels for an extensionordered to by the Commons, although Downing Street said the Government would only seek a short delay of a few months.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Prime Minister’s deal was “clearly dead” and called for a general election.“The Prime Minister is threatening us all with the danger of No Deal, knowing full well the damage it will do to the British economy,” Mr Corbyn said. “The Prime Minister has run down the clock and the clock has been run out on her.“Nicola Sturgeon said the Prime Minister and the government “should be hanging their heads in shame” and demanded that Brexit be delayed and a no-deal outcome ruled out.“We now have a government that has effectively ceased toand a country that remains poised on a clf edge,” the First Minister said.“Scotland’s needs and voice have been ignored by the UK Government throughout the Brexit process, and today a handful of DUP MPs held more sway over Scotland’s future than our own national Parliament – that demonstrates more clearly than ever that the case for Scotland becoming an independent country has never been stronger.”Just  Tory MPs who helped deliver a record -vote defeat for her deal in January changed their minds after a last-minute dash to Strasbourg to secure assurances on the backstop on Monday, and appeals from the Prime Minister yesterday.“I profoundly regret the decision that this House has taken tonight,” Mrs May told MPs moments after the result was confirmed.“I continue to believe that by far the best outcome is that the UK leaves the EU in an orderly fashion with a deal, and that the deal we have negotiated is the best and indeed the only deal available.”The Prime Minister said the country now faced “unenviable choices” evenMPs vote to delay Brexit.“Let me be clear,” she said. “Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face.“The EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension.”: Brexit: Nicola Sturgeon ‘told she wasn’t bright enough’ to understand May’s dealWith the EU ruling out any further renegotiation of the Brexit agreement, Downing Street did not rule out bringing it back before MPsthey reject no-deal.Mrs May told MPs they would vote tomorrow night on a motion that states: “This House declines to approve leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework on the Future Relationship on  March  and notes that leaving without a deal remains the default in UK and EU law unless this House and the EU raty an agreement.”Amendments over the next two days are likely to include proposals for a second EU referendum, which the Prime Minister admitted was now an option.EU leaders warned they would not automatically grant a delay to Brexit, which must be approved unanimously by all  other member states.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: “Should the UK hand in a reasoned requestfor an extension, I expect a credible and convincing justication.“The smooth ing of the EU institutions needs to be ensured.”“On EU side we’ve done all that’s possible to reach an agreement,” Mr Tusk’s spokesman said. “It’s dficult to see what more we can do. If there’s a solution to the current impasse it can only be found in London.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit why scotland faces a slow decline alistair heather","story":"Brexit will not be a clf but a long decline, with a steady trickling away of energy and vibrancy from Scotland, a country with closer cultural ties to Europe than you might think, writes Alistair Heather.At some point soon, we will be stripped of our European citizenship. Our wives, husbands, hated neighbours, loved friends, tolerated colleagues, any and all Europeans that live here will be stripped of their rights and become less than us. Less secure, less valued, less physically safe. Our institutions will be impaired, our horizons narrowed.Edinburgh will be reduced for the second time in its history. After the loss of the national parliament in , it ceased to be a capital. Within Europe, its light, relit, has burned brightly for  years, and the city has taken its place as one of the great capitals. With Brexit this light will dim. Edinburgh will be cast down into parochiality. A secondary city within a secondary region of the UK. The city of the Enlightenment will be in the same all-British bracket as Slough, Norwich, Wolverhampton.For decades our horizons have been wide open. Paris, Rome, Prague, Helsinki. Scots have found berths in every one of these places, contributing to the community they find themselves in, acting as bees in the cross pollination of good ideas that has been helping the intellectual economy and cultural integration of Europe blossom.This is Scotland’s right historic place. We are on the edge of Northern Europe. Sutherland, Caithness and much of the Western Isles, not to mention Orkney and Shetland were domains with shared populations and experiences with Iceland, Norway, Greenland. Iceland’s women are  per cent descended from Scottish and Irish women.We are just a short stretch of water from the continent, and in the past those seaways have seemed like motorways. Poland teems with the ancestors of the , Scots families that flitted across the North Sea in the s, trading the famine raging at home for opportunities abroad. Scottish surnames given Polish inflection over the years include Kietzs , Losons, Ramzes and Szynklers. The four-time mayor of Warsaw between  and  Aleksander Czamer was born Alexander Chalmers in Dyce, Aberdeenshire.: Poll: Scottish independence more popular than Theresa May’s Brexit dealMore than genetics, more than common names bind us to our European neighbours. The very words in our mouths indicate our shared past and common present. The Scots language has common words in the Scandinavian language – such as ‘bairn’ for child and ‘braw’ for good – and in Ireland, our near European neighbour, Ulster Scots retains some vibrancy. Our own Scots Gaelic started le as the Ulster dialect of Irish, the shared languages evidence of endless Hiberno-Scottish relations. In Switzerland, I was surprised to come across a ft statue of Scotland’s queen-bothering reformer John Knox, towering above a central city park. At the statue’s feet was a massive mosaic of the Lion Rampant, Scotland’s ancient emblem. Behind the statue in the old town is the Kirk of Scotland. Elsewhere in the city, you’ll find the Genevan Gaelic choir meeting, and on other nights the Swiss Scottish Country Dancing Society.Some might say that these glory days of European influence are behind us. That Europe was our past and Brexit our future. Not so. Scotland is becoming more European as the years pass, not less.There are many tens of thousands of new Scots who are absolutely European, and no vote will change that. The Polish, Baltic state, Romanian migrants and their children, many Scottish born, who make up chunks of our population are and will remain European. Their next generation will likely be at least bilingual, with one modern European language as a mother tongue. Much as the great Irish migrations have redoubled the connections between Scotland and Ireland, so too will the legacy of the more recent eastern European migrations culturally tether future Scots to those countries.This is not an article in defence of the EU. This is an article in favour of open borders, of knowledge sharing, and of cooperation. I’m aware that the EU also creates borders and enmity with Russia, with Turkey and others. But saying the EU is too exclusive and so choosing Brexit is like complaining of claustrophobia in a large public park and curing it by upturning a bucket on your head.: Brian Monteith: Only a clean Brexit break can save us nowScots are Europeans by language, by history, by ancestry, by geography and by experience. Isolated from Europe, Scotland will be heading for another period of intellectual darkness.Our famous universities are amongst the best in the world. And our population is the second best-educated in Europe, in terms of university degrees per head. This is an enviable position for a small country to be in. And it’s down exclusively to internationalism and tight European connections. Our universities certainly carry out groundbreaking research, but they generally do so with large EU grants, or in conjunction with other universities. They almost always conduct research and education with large staffs of EU nationals, who will soon become legally insecure.The impact is already being felt. Scottish universities experienced a drop-off in applicants from EU countries. EU students are vital, as, although they are generally fee-free, they have a massive economic impact on the community around the university. They rent expensive flats, spend student loans in shops and bars, and work lower-paid jobs during their studies. When they graduate many stay, making positive contributions to their community and the economy. Those that leave become positive ambassadors for Scottish education internationally.In what can only be described as an intentional and massive ‘get it right up you, Scotland’, the Home Office has committed to offering EU students three-year visas to study in the UK. Degrees in Scotland take four years. In England, most take three.Our universities provide superb education to massive numbers of working-class and lower-income Scots. They are one of the key tools in providing social mobility in Scotland. They allow us to mix with European and international students, to form relationships that last letimes, to engage in projects and enterprises across a infinite number of fields. They are Scotland’s window to the world. They are a window through which Scots can reach out and have a positive impact internationally. Brexit will do much to close that window.Holyrood has been damaged too. How can we look to the parliament in Edinburgh as anything other than a diddy wee ‘pretendy’ parliament, when it can do nothing to either prevent Brexit or gain Scotland’s independence  There’s been a pro-European, pro-independence majority in there for umpteen years, and yet we are set to lose our European citizenship thanks to an English majority in its favour.All this talk of clf edges probably isn’t correct.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work.

It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives.

It honours the UK’s solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“If we ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not a template for our future relationship.“The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear and legally-binding changes were needed to set that right. We have now agreed them.“The EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely which can be challenged.“Now it is time to come together and back this improved deal.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the new agreements were an “unambiguous statement” of both sides’ “good faith and intentions” but also made it clear they did not undermine the principle of the backstop.“We have insisted that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be rewritten, and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until it is replaced by future arrangements that can achieve the same objective, namely no hard border,” he said.“However, we have also said that we were prepared to offer guarantees and further reassurances and to the UK of our good faith and intentions – indeed we have offered such reassurances on many occasions.“The Instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed. “It does not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, or undermine the backstop or its application. “It says that we will work together, in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures that the objectives of the Protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met. “The documents agreed yesterday reiterate our wish to establish a future partnership with the UK that is as close as possible, and marks our commitment to ensure that negotiations on that future relationship can begin as soon as the UK leaves. “The instrument agreed sets out how we will go about this important work. “In many ways, Brexit has been a dark cloud over us for many months, and particularly the threat of no deal. A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the European Union. “We now need to see the Withdrawal Agreement ratied by Westminster and by the European Parliament without further delay, so that we can get on with the important work of building the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, and between the UK and Ireland, post Brexit. “I know feel that for the remains of the day, we need to give MPs in Westminster the time and space to consider what#s now on the table.” All eyes now turn to UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox who will later today give his considered assessment of whether what Mrs May has secured is legally binding. His response is expected to be key in deciding what way Brexit hardliners – notably Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ERG and the DUP – will vote this evening.

But now, it seems the only paths are to see a catastrophic no deal outcome, the Government working across the House of Commons to find a softer version of Brexit, or reconsidering Brexit in its entirety,# she said.“In the short run, taking a no deal off the table must be the immediate priority. In itself and without a clear plan, this resolves nothing. The House of Commons is good at saying what it is against, but can’t manage to give a clear answer on what it is for. But the UK is too close to the clf-edge and every day of uncertainty sees more and more economic and social damage.“The clearest, most coherent and most democratic route through this impasse lies with a People’s Vote, including both the Prime Minister’s deal and the Remain option. This needs to be tested in Parliament as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"two more people to stand trial linked to meli case","story":"TWO more people are to stand trial on offences arising out of the murder of Christopher Meli.-year-old Daniel McManus, of Springbank Drive, and Shannon McIIwaine , of Glenalina Park, both in West Belfast, appeared at Belfast Crown Court on Friday for a ruling on their case.Mr Justice Colton dismissed applications by their legal teams to have charges of affray dismissed on the grounds of insufficient evidence.The senior judge said that although they were not accused of engaging in violence on the night of Mr Meli’s murder in December , he had come to the conclusion, “that their conduct taken at its height is sufficient to put each of the defendants on trial for affray.”Dismissing the application, Mr Justice Colton added: “I am satisfied that the affray took place in a public place and in such a manner that a bystander or reasonably firm character might reasonably expect it to be terrying.” Following his ruling, both defendants were formally arraigned on a single count that they “unlawfully displayed force and made affray” on December, , .Both replied “not guilty” and were released on continuing bail ahead of the start of their trial on September .In January this year, six other people were ed for trial in connection with Mr Meli’s murder.Three are charged with murdering the -year-old father-of-one, while their co-accused face other charges linked to alleged incidents on the evening.Mr Meli was beaten to death at Doc’s Path in the Glasvey Close area of Twinbrook.At the time police, believed up to  young people were involved in a number of violent incidents that culminated in his death.All six accused appeared at Belfast Crown Court where they heard the trial could last up to  weeks.The trio accused of murdering Mr Meli are Caolan Lavertyof Belfast Road in Glenavy, Stephen McCannof Dundrinne Road in Castlewellan and -year-old Lee Smyth, who was living at an undisclosed address in County Antrim.

On the back of the same sign post, an anti-Brexit poster demands \"No EU frontier\" on the island of Ireland.Present-day Ballyconnell appears to be thriving, with hardly an unoccupied shop on a main street dominated by local businesses.The areas economy has long been buoyed by the nearby factories that once comprised the empire of former billionaire, Sean Quinn. Five minutes would seldom pass without a Quinn-branded lorry rumbling over the border between Ballyconnell and Derrylin in Co Fermanagh.Butcher Gerard Crowe, who has been trading in Ballyconnell for  years, used to own a second shop in Derrylin during the Troubles. He closed it in , having found a daily two-hour wait on either side of the border checkpoints unmanageable.He said Brexit has already had an impact on northern trade, with the number of shoppers from across the border halving in the last year. \"The fluctuation in sterling is having a knock-on effect on peoples salaries, so there are less coming south because it is costing them more,\" he said. \"We are all suffering to a degree.

He said northern trade has always been important.\"We would have a lot of people from the north coming over to Ballyconnell,\" he said. \"Derrylin would consider Ballyconnell as one of the major towns in the area, so we would have a lot of footfall and a lot of business across the border.

have sympathy with the Prime Minister on her voice and I hope it soon recovers, I understand how painful this is.”May answers Prime Minister’s QuestionsPrime Minister Theresa May has said she will be

said: “Refusing to comply with our responsibilities under international trade law to operate a customs border at any frontier is not a serious or sustainable solution to the problem of a hard border that Brexit – of any iety – threatens.“Today’s ill thought-out proposals on tarfs and customs illustrate the political, economic and reputational risk that the Government’s make-it-up-as-we-go-along approach poses to the United Kingdom.“Today the Commons must reject any prospect of a no-deal Brexit and on Thursday they should make sure any extension of the Article  deadline is used to deliver the clarity about Brexit that has been missing from the last two-and-a-half years of debate.”SNP bids to take no deal off the tableSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford tweeted an image of an amendment

Damian Green and Nicky Morgan have both put their names to it as well as myself and Jacob Rees-Mogg from the ‘Leave’ side. Today a Labour colleague has agreed to put her name to it as well.“We think there is a majority for our compromise we’ve tabled – it seeks to throw three safety nets around leaving without a withdrawal agreement.”Nigel Farage addresses the European ParliamentThe solution to avoid hordes of new Brexit Party MEPs being elected is for the European Council to veto any extension of Article  and ensure we leave on March . pic jYLBAYjPk— Nigel FarageMarch , Ending tarfs ‘a hammer blow’Responding to the Government’s announcement of a no-deal tarf scheme, TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Ending tarfs in the event of a no-deal Brexit would be a hammer blow to our manufacturing industries and the communities they support.“The Government is flying blind, having introduced these plans without any consultation with the workers they will affect. We need a full and proper impact assessment.“Ministers must not show such reckless disregard for people’s jobs.“MPs must vote to take no-deal off the table. And the Prime Minister needs to ditch her destructive red lines, which threaten working people’s jobs and rights.”Find a way out of this mess, UK urgedI have always said #Brexit is also a failure of the European Union. The place of the United Kingdom is in the European Union. I am sure a younger generation will one day take another decision and bring Britain back into the European family. #EPlenary— Guy VerhofstadtMarch , #Brexit is supposed to be about ‘taking back control’. The big slogan of the Brexiteers. Instead, it seems to be spinning ‘out of control’. #EPlenary— Guy VerhofstadtMarch , My plea to our British friends  Put all your energy into finding a cross-party majority to find a way out of this mess. There is no solutionboth big parties are using this existential issue as a bullet in a weapon against each other. Queen and country needs to come first.— Guy VerhofstadtMarch , I hope a no deal is massively rejected today  the UK Parliament position on an extension is known tomorrow. I am against any extension of Article , even for just  hours,it is not based on a clear majority from the House of Commons in favour of something.— Guy VerhofstadtMarch , ‘He will die not seeing Brexit’Steven Woolfe, MEP for North West England, told the plenary session his uncle was diagnosed with a terminal illness two days ago and he will die this weekend.He said: “He voted to leave… and he will die not seeing Brexit.“He will die not seeing Brexit because of a political class that despise him and voters in Britain who believe that they are far superior in the way that they think they should control our lives and do not wish to listen to the voters who wanted to get rid of them.”Farage: We’ve had enoughNigel Farage told MEPS: “We have had enough, we have seen the snarling anger towards our country of Mr Verhofstadt, the bureaucratic intransigence of Mr Barnier, the constant stream of insults that come from Mr Tusk, and we are of one mind: we don’t want to be governed by you we want to govern ourselves.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Nigel Farage at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Responding to Mr Barnier’s estimation of how long negotiations about the EU-UK future relationship could take, he said: “We don’t want to waste four more years of our le, four more years of agony.”He called for any extension request from Britain to be vetoed, adding: “We leave, and both you and we can get on with the rest of our lives. That’s the only neat solution ahead of us.”‘Please make up your minds’Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, called for the UK to put “queen and country” before party politics, appealing for certainty from the House of Commons.He told MEPs in Strasbourg: “That is what we need and so I am against every extension, whether an extension of one day, one week, even  hours,it’s not based on a clear opinion of the House of Commons for something. That we know what they want.”He added: “Please make up your minds in London, because this uncertainty cannot continue. Not for us, not for Britain and certainly not for our citizens.”Watch: Countdown to Brexit‘No hard border’Ireland’s Europe Minister Helen McEntee reiterated that Ireland was not planning for a hard border on the island.She said people in Northern Ireland did not want the Withdrawal Agreement to be cast aside and ministers in the Republic were still not planning to allow the introduction of a physical border on the island.“It is not something that we as a Government have been planning for, it is not something that we are thinking about and it is not something that we would allow.”She said the UK and Ireland collectively had obligations as co-guarantors of the  Good Friday peace agreement to protect the peace process.Flying the flagFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage attended this morning’s plenary session at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  ‘Appalling’ timing for tarfs updateNational Farmers’ Union president Minette Batters said it was “appalling” the import tarfs which will be applied in the event of no-deal had only been published a fortnight before they could be coming into effect.She welcomed the Government’s move to treat many agricultural sectors “sensitively” but raised concerns over sectors which would not have such protection, such as eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables.“Even those sectors that are treated sensitively will, in most instances, see worrying and large reductions in the tarf rates currently charged on non-EU imports,” she said.“We recognise the importance of ensuring food prices for consumers do not rise in a no-deal Brexit but we are deeply concerned that the approach to tarfs published today will mean a greater reliance on food produced overseas.”And she urged MPs and Government to take “no-deal” off the table and find a workable solution as a matter of urgency.Deal remains ‘only available treaty’The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told the European Parliament that the Withdrawal Agreement reached last November “is and will remain the only available treaty”.In agreeing to draw up documents clarying the terms of the Agreement in Strasbourg on Monday, “we went as far as we possibly could in order to help the UK Government get the support of the House of Commons”, said Mr Barnier.The EU has done everything it can to help get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line. The impasse can only be solved in the #UK. Our “no-deal” preparations are now more important than ever before.— Michel BarnierMarch , Mr Barnier said it was now “the responsibility of the UK” to suggest a way forward.“They have to tell us what it is they want for their future relationship,” he told the European Parliament.“What will their choice be, what will be the line they will take  That is the question we need a clear answer to now. That is the question that has to be answered before a decision on a possible further extension.“Why would we extend these discussions  The discussion on Article  is done and dusted. We have the Withdrawal Agreement. It is there.“That is the question asked and we are waiting for an answer to that.” Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson claimed the EU would come up with a new deal by March .He told LBC Radio: “I covered a lot of EU summits, I have been to a lot of them in my time, I have seen how the EU works.“The horses always change places in the final furlong, it’s always at five minutes to midnight that the real deal is done.“In Brussels the real fix is always in at the end.”Cameron: No deal a disasterDavid Cameron has warned MPs that failing to rule out a no-deal Brexit would be a “disaster” for Britain.The former Conservative prime minister said he backed Theresa May’s attempts to secure a deal despite her second overwhelming defeat in Parliament on Tuesday night.He told Sky News: “I’ve always supported the Prime Minister in her attempts to have a close partnership deal with Europe and she continues to have my support.“That’s the right thing to do. Obviously what needs to happen next is to rule out no deal, that would be a disaster for our country, and to seek an extension and I’m sure that’s what’s going to happen next.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Warning over no-deal tarf regimeA new tarf regime on EU products in the case of a no-deal Brexit will act as a “sledgehammer” to the UK economy, business has warned.The new levies, to be imposed from the day after a March  BrexitMPs vote for a no-deal withdrawal, would force up prices on EU imports including cars and many food products.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The unilateral and temporary regime includes levies of .% on European cars and trucks which had previously been free of tarfs, potentially increasing the cost of a typical family hatchback by around £,.

The second half continued to be a feisty affair and a great spectacle for the neutral spectator.With the lowered sun in Ballynahinchrsquos eyes, Ballymena did the smart thing and constantly took the high router, creating numerous scoring opportunities for Ballymena.Unfortunately, for lsquoHinch, their lead didnrsquot last too long as Ballymena bounced back with another great counter-attacking goal to make it -.It was end-to-end stuff, like the first half, the best of the chances falling to Millar, McIlwaine and Campbell only to be denied by the hard-working Ballymena defence and lsquokeeper.Cards were shown to both sides with William Edgar, Andrew Mulholland and Tim Crean doing time on the sideline.Ballymena had decent short corner chances, but were closed down well by Ashley Brown, Rea Coffey and of course Aaron Donnell.lsquoHinch had a few shorts of their own, but couldnrsquot convert. With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot. The Orkneys was problematic as itrsquos a long way away. It would also have costed a lot of money to tow up into position but also the conditions up there were not what was needed.ldquoOur Strangford site has fast-flowing water, a pure rock sea bed and is a stonersquos throw from the shoreline.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space.

They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced.

However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass.

Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

While planning permission was secured, the proposal fell through due to the adverse economic circumstances at the town.The site was subsequently sold several years ago to a local businessman who is behind the new proposal to redevelop site which has been approved by a range of statutory agencies.Itrsquos understood access to the proposed new hotel will be via Inch Abbey Road, with parking located to the side and rear of the new , square metre building. There will also be a dedicated parking area for coaches.Original plans for the new hotel described finishing the exterior of the building in stone slate, with the accommodation centred around a landscaped courtyard. The proposed hotel development also includes plans to upgrade the Inch Abbey Road junction with the Belfast Road.News that the exciting new proposal is set to be given the green light next week comes after recent confirmation that planning permission is being sought to provide  new hotel rooms in Downpatrick town centre.The Downpatrick Property Trust is aiming to convert a number of existing flats at the junction of Market Street and Irish Street to provide what is being described as ldquooverflow hotel bedroom accommodation for nearby Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn.The proposal is also seeking permission for several hotel serviced apartments and to convert existing ground floor retail accommodation in Irish Street to a wheelchair accessible bedroom with an en-suite shower and toilet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has placed tourism at the top of its agenda and is striving to attract more international visitors to stay overnight across the district. It has highlighted the need for additional hotel accommodation across the district.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran hopes the plannersrsquo recommendation for the Belfast Road site will be approved next week, paving the way for what he described as an ldquoexciting new development to help increase visitor number, provide new jobs and boost the local economy.He said the project would create jobs in the construction industry, provide a boost for local buildersrsquo suppliers and act as a catalyst for additional private sector investment.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere is a need for more bed space in Downpatrick and this new development, which will complement existing provision, is most welcome. The fact that new conference facilities form part of the new hotel proposal is an added boost to the town.ldquoThe new hotel will help the local council with its drive to attract more overnight visitors to the district and I very much look forward to construction work getting underway..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"The pride of Portaferry  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Ciara Mageean was the toast of Irish athletics in Scotland on Sunday night.The  year-old middle distance runner won bronze in the m race at the European Indoor Championships in Glasgow mdash but it could so easily have been silver.Mageean clocked a time of :. behind runaway winner Laura Muir of Great Britain and was pipped on the line by Polandrsquos Sofia Ennaoui.It is her first indoor medal at European level and goes along a bronze won over the same distance outdoors at the  European Championships.Ciara ran a patient race, taking an outside route during the bunched start, and as hometown hero Muir began to pick up the pace she looked assured of a medal going into the final lap.It looked for a time like it might be silver as she headed Ennaoui coming off the final bend, but she cruelly beaten on the line.She said afterwards: ldquoPeople talk about dferent things in athletics, but I donrsquot do it for the money, and the amazing times are very few and far in between.For Mageean there was also added justication in her move to Manchester in late  after a below-par run at the World Championships in London.She said she was delighted to win bronze, but admitted that she was slightly annoyed that it was not silver.ldquoI came into these championships to win a medal.

Once again, she’s putting her party’s interests ahead of the public interest.”Struggling with a croaky voice, Mrs May said that she still believed that leaving with a deal was the best option for Britain and that “the deal we’ve negotiated is the best and indeed the only deal available.”She added: “Let me be clear. Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face.“The EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension and this House will have to answer that question. Does it wish to revoke Article   Does it want to hold a second referendum  Or does it want to leave with a deal, but not this deal “These are unenviable choices. Thanks to the decision that the House has made this evening, they are choices that must now be faced.”An extension requires the unanimous agreement of all  remaining member states, and Mr Juncker has warned that it cannot stretch beyond May  unless the UK takes part in the European Parliament elections starting on that date.DUP will not back May’s Brexit deal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Following the vote, a spokesman for European Council president Donald Tusk said: “On the EU side we have done all that is possible to reach an agreement. Given the additional assurances provided by the EU in December, January and yesterday, it is dficult to see what more we can do. If there is a solution to the current impasse it can only be found in London.”The spokesman said that the EU stood by the Withdrawal Agreement reached in November.But he added: “With only  days left to March , today’s vote has signicantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. We will continue our no-deal preparations and ensure that we will be readysuch a scenario arises.“Should there be a UK reasoned request for an extension, the EU will consider it and decide by unanimity. The EU will expect a credible justication for a possible extension and its duration. The smooth ing of the EU institutions will need to be ensured.”Cabinet gave its approval to Mrs May’s package at an early-morning meeting in  Downing Street which ended with the PM telling colleagues: “Today is the day. Let’s get this done.”But the momentum moved sharply against the Prime Minister shortly afterwards, as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox released formal legal advice that the changes secured by Mrs May “reduce the risk” that the backstop will be permanent, but do not remove it altogether.The Star Chamber of lawyers convened by the Brexit-backing European Research Group declared that three new documents agreed in Strasbourg failed to deliver the legally-binding changes demanded by the Commons.And the Democratic Unionist Party — which props up Mrs May’s minority administration in the Commons — said its  MPs would vote against the latest deal as “sufficient progress has not been achieved at this time”.With husband Philip watching from the Commons gallery, the Prime Minister warned MPs that “Brexit could be lost”they gave her deal the thumbs-down again.But she met a wall of hostility from her own party as well as the opposition parties, with  Conservative MPs voting against along with  Labour,  SNP,  Liberal Democrats,  DUP, four Plaid Cymru,  Independents and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that “no signicant changes” had been secured in two months of negotiations and the Government’s strategy was “in tatters”.Brexit figurehead and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told the Commons that Mrs May and Mr Cox had “sowed an apron of fig leaves that does nothing to conceal the embarrassment and indignity of the UK.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Commons: “After three months of running down the clock the Prime Minister has, despite very extensive delays, achieved not a single change to the Withdrawal Agreement.“Not one single word has changed. In terms of the substance, literally, nothing has changed.”Charles Walker, vice chairman of the  Committee of backbench Tory MPs, warned that defeat in the second “meaningful vote” on Tuesday evening would lead to a general election.He told BBC Radio ’s World At One: “If it doesn’t go through tonight, as sure as night follows day, there will be a general election within a matter of days or weeks.“It is not sustainable, the current situation in Parliament.”try catch  TrendingStorm Gareth worse than originally thought - N.I. to be pummelled by mph galesNewry murders: Distraught father will lsquosell taxirsquo for chance to say goodbyePolice not seeking anyone  in connection with Newry deathsN.I. child reported missing is found safe and wellN.I.

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty. It is also a hazard to pedestrians.ldquoIt is illegal to deposit mud on the public highway. Why the Conservative Independent Council has been so ineffective is beyond me.ldquoNot content with creating these awful conditions a trench has been excavated across the entrance to the busy Medical Centre.ldquoThis resulted in the entrance being narrowed.The failure to engage with the Medical Centre is a disgrace.The trench excavation was carried out by the Gas Transportation Company Ltd in a separate development.The medical centre used Facebook to warn residents attempting to access the site that contractors had partially blocked the entrance.Plaid Councillor Richard Grigg said: ldquoThis site has been operational since last summer.ldquoIt is only now that hopefully a decent wheel wash has been installed.ldquoWhy has the County Council been so uncaring about this situation ldquoThey have a duty to protect the community.ldquoThe site which was sold to the builders by the council for millions has been a real problem with huge contractorsrsquo vehicles causing chaos on local roads. The planning process has totally failed Dinas Powys.Steve Williams, managing director of Barratt Homes South Wales, said: ldquoWe always strive to minimise the effects of construction and apologise to anyone who has been inconvenienced by work in Dinas Powys.ldquoWe have a jet wash on site during opening hours to clean the tyres of vehicles leaving the development throughout the day.The construction is part of the Local Development Plan that will see , new homes built in the Vale of Glamorgan over the next eight years.Planning permission had been granted in February , despite criticisms of the impact that the new site would have on congestion in and around Dinas Powys, which, planning officers confirmed, is already at maximum capacity.While acknowledging extra homes would generate more traffic, officers said increases would be negligible and traffic around Murch Road and Cardf Road would be over capacity in several years regardless. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty. It is also a hazard to pedestrians.ldquoIt is illegal to deposit mud on the public highway. Why the Conservative Independent Council has been so ineffective is beyond me.ldquoNot content with creating these awful conditions a trench has been excavated across the entrance to the busy Medical Centre.ldquoThis resulted in the entrance being narrowed.The failure to engage with the Medical Centre is a disgrace.The trench excavation was carried out by the Gas Transportation Company Ltd in a separate development.The medical centre used Facebook to warn residents attempting to access the site that contractors had partially blocked the entrance.Plaid Councillor Richard Grigg said: ldquoThis site has been operational since last summer.ldquoIt is only now that hopefully a decent wheel wash has been installed.ldquoWhy has the County Council been so uncaring about this situation ldquoThey have a duty to protect the community.ldquoThe site which was sold to the builders by the council for millions has been a real problem with huge contractorsrsquo vehicles causing chaos on local roads. The planning process has totally failed Dinas Powys.Steve Williams, managing director of Barratt Homes South Wales, said: ldquoWe always strive to minimise the effects of construction and apologise to anyone who has been inconvenienced by work in Dinas Powys.ldquoWe have a jet wash on site during opening hours to clean the tyres of vehicles leaving the development throughout the day.The construction is part of the Local Development Plan that will see , new homes built in the Vale of Glamorgan over the next eight years.Planning permission had been granted in February , despite criticisms of the impact that the new site would have on congestion in and around Dinas Powys, which, planning officers confirmed, is already at maximum capacity.While acknowledging extra homes would generate more traffic, officers said increases would be negligible and traffic around Murch Road and Cardf Road would be over capacity in several years regardless. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The place of the United Kingdom is in the European Union. I am sure a younger generation will one day take another decision and bring Britain back into the European family. #EPlenarymdash Guy VerhofstadtMarch , #Brexit is supposed to be about lsquotaking back controlrsquo. The big slogan of the Brexiteers. Instead, it seems to be spinning lsquoout of controlrsquo. #EPlenarymdash Guy VerhofstadtMarch , My plea to our British friends  Put all your energy into finding a cross-party majority to find a way out of this mess. There is no solutionboth big parties are using this existential issue as a bullet in a weapon against each other. Queen and country needs to come first.mdash Guy VerhofstadtMarch , I hope a no deal is massively rejected today  the UK Parliament position on an extension is known tomorrow. I am against any extension of Article , even for just  hours,it is not based on a clear majority from the House of Commons in favour of something.mdash Guy VerhofstadtMarch , lsquoHe will die not seeing BrexitrsquoSteven Woolfe, MEP for North West England, told the plenary session his uncle was diagnosed with a terminal illness two days ago and he will die this weekend.He said: ldquoHe voted to leavehellip and he will die not seeing Brexit.ldquoHe will die not seeing Brexit because of a political class that despise him and voters in Britain who believe that they are far superior in the way that they think they should control our lives and do not wish to listen to the voters who wanted to get rid of them.Farage: Wersquove had enoughNigel Farage told MEPS: ldquoWe have had enough, we have seen the snarling anger towards our country of Mr Verhofstadt, the bureaucratic intransigence of Mr Barnier, the constant stream of insults that come from Mr Tusk, and we are of one mind: we donrsquot want to be governed by you we want to govern ourselves.Nigel Farage at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Responding to Mr Barnierrsquos estimation of how long negotiations about the EU-UK future relationship could take, he said: ldquoWe donrsquot want to waste four more years of our le, four more years of agony.He called for any extension request from Britain to be vetoed, adding: ldquoWe leave, and both you and we can get on with the rest of our lives. Thatrsquos the only neat solution ahead of us.lsquoPlease make up your mindsrsquoGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliamentrsquos Brexit co-ordinator, called for the UK to put ldquoqueen and country before party politics, appealing for certainty from the House of Commons.He told MEPs in Strasbourg: ldquoThat is what we need and so I am against every extension, whether an extension of one day, one week, even  hours,itrsquos not based on a clear opinion of the House of Commons for something. That we know what they want.He added: ldquoPlease make up your minds in London, because this uncertainty cannot continue. Not for us, not for Britain and certainly not for our citizens.Watch: Countdown to BrexitlsquoNo hard borderrsquoIrelandrsquos Europe Minister Helen McEntee reiterated that Ireland was not planning for a hard border on the island.She said people in Northern Ireland did not want the Withdrawal Agreement to be cast aside and ministers in the Republic were still not planning to allow the introduction of a physical border on the island.ldquoIt is not something that we as a Government have been planning for, it is not something that we are thinking about and it is not something that we would allow.She said the UK and Ireland collectively had obligations as co-guarantors of the  Good Friday peace agreement to protect the peace process.Flying the flagFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage attended this morningrsquos plenary session at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.lsquoAppallingrsquo timing for tarfs updateNational Farmersrsquo Union president Minette Batters said it was ldquoappalling the import tarfs which will be applied in the event of no-deal had only been published a fortnight before they could be coming into effect.She welcomed the Governmentrsquos move to treat many agricultural sectors ldquosensitively but raised concerns over sectors which would not have such protection, such as eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables.ldquoEven those sectors that are treated sensitively will, in most instances, see worrying and large reductions in the tarf rates currently charged on non-EU imports, she said.ldquoWe recognise the importance of ensuring food prices for consumers do not rise in a no-deal Brexit but we are deeply concerned that the approach to tarfs published today will mean a greater reliance on food produced overseas.And she urged MPs and Government to take ldquono-deal off the table and find a workable solution as a matter of urgency.Deal remains lsquoonly available treatyrsquoThe EUrsquos chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told the European Parliament that the Withdrawal Agreement reached last November ldquois and will remain the only available treaty.In agreeing to draw up documents clarying the terms of the Agreement in Strasbourg on Monday, ldquowe went as far as we possibly could in order to help the UK Government get the support of the House of Commons, said Mr Barnier.The EU has done everything it can to help get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line. The impasse can only be solved in the #UK. Our ldquono-deal preparations are now more important than ever before.mdash Michel BarnierMarch , Mr Barnier said it was now ldquothe responsibility of the UK to suggest a way forward.ldquoThey have to tell us what it is they want for their future relationship, he told the European Parliament.ldquoWhat will their choice be, what will be the line they will take  That is the question we need a clear answer to now. That is the question that has to be answered before a decision on a possible further extension.ldquoWhy would we extend these discussions  The discussion on Article  is done and dusted. We have the Withdrawal Agreement. It is there.ldquoThat is the question asked and we are waiting for an answer to that.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson claimed the EU would come up with a new deal by March .He told LBC Radio: ldquoI covered a lot of EU summits, I have been to a lot of them in my time, I have seen how the EU works.ldquoThe horses always change places in the final furlong, itrsquos always at five minutes to midnight that the real deal is done.ldquoIn Brussels the real fix is always in at the end.Cameron: No deal a disasterDavid Cameron has warned MPs that failing to rule out a no-deal Brexit would be a ldquodisaster for Britain.The former Conservative prime minister said he backed Theresa Mayrsquos attempts to secure a deal despite her second overwhelming defeat in Parliament on Tuesday night.He told Sky News: ldquoIrsquove always supported the Prime Minister in her attempts to have a close partnership deal with Europe and she continues to have my support.ldquoThatrsquos the right thing to do. Obviously what needs to happen next is to rule out no deal, that would be a disaster for our country, and to seek an extension and Irsquom sure thatrsquos whatrsquos going to happen next.Warning over no-deal tarf regimeA new tarf regime on EU products in the case of a no-deal Brexit will act as a ldquosledgehammer to the UK economy, business has warned.The new levies, to be imposed from the day after a March  BrexitMPs vote for a no-deal withdrawal, would force up prices on EU imports including cars and many food products.The unilateral and temporary regime includes levies of .% on European cars and trucks which had previously been free of tarfs, potentially increasing the cost of a typical family hatchback by around pound,. Car parts would face no extra tarfs to avoid disruption to supply chains.But tarfs will be slashed on imports from outside the EU, potentially lowering prices on goods from countries like the USA and China.CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told BBC Radio rsquos Today: ldquoThis tells us everything that is wrong with a no-deal scenario..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Brexit live: Debate continues as MPs prepare to vote on blocking no deal article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It’s what you are doing and what you get paid, and I think it’s right that the whole aspect is being investigated.”Lorraine Kelly lent her voice to the cause of gender pay parity, saying she had been lucky not to be affected by disparities during her career, and that she believes things cannot regress on female rights at work.She said: “To be honest, I do think it’s getting better, I’m very optimistic about it.

However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.
