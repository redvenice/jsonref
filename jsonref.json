Currently their lamb prices into the UK are higher than we can produce lamb at.’Asked whether the UK market would be flooded with hormone-injected beef from Australia under the new trade deal, Ms Truss replied: ‘Well, we won’t because we are banning, we have banned hormone-injected beef.‘Hormone-injected beef will not be allowed in the UK, full stop, so he doesn’t need to worry about that.’She added: ‘That is banned already. We already import Australian beef and lamb into the UK. That Australian beef and lamb has to fit UK standards.’Many farms in Australia are much larger than their UK counterparts, enabling them to produce food at lower prices.  Asked about UK farmers potentially being undercut, Ms Truss said: ‘UK beef is very competitive and we are already exporting it to markets around the world so I am fully confident that our farmers will be able to compete.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry constantly anxious lose Meghan like lost Diana says royal expert","story":"Share this articleAsked by Oprah if he had any regrets, Harry also said he wished that he had taken a stronger stance on \u0027the racism\u0027 aimed at Meghan early in their relationship.\u0027By this point, both of us were in shock,\u0027 he said. \u0027My mother was chased to her death while she was in a relationship with someone that wasn\u0027t white. \u0027And now look at what\u0027s happened. And it all comes back to the same people, the same business model, the same industry.\u0027Asked whether he had regrets, he replied: \u0027My biggest regret is not making more of a stance. Calling out racism when I did. History was repeating itself.\u0027Harry claimed that it was only him and their unborn child that kept Meghan going, after she told him about her suicidal thoughts and the practicalities of how she was going to end her life.He said: \u0027The thing that stopped her from seeing it through was how unfair it would be on me after everything that had happened to my mum and to now be put in a position of losing another woman in my life, with a baby inside of her, our baby.\u0027He said he was \u0027somewhat ashamed\u0027 of the way he dealt with it, suggesting that rather than prioritising their official duties they should have pulled out. But at the time, Harry said, that was not an option, because of \u0027the system\u0027.Harry said that after marrying Meghan his attempts to get help from his family, following online trolling which was pushing her to the brink, were ignored.He said: \u0027Every single ask, request, warning, whatever it is, to stop just got met with total silence or total neglect.\u0027Harry added: \u0027We spent four years trying to make it work. We did everything that we possibly could to stay there and carry on doing the role and doing the job.\u0027He said he did not go to his family when Meghan felt suicidal because he was ashamed the situation had got \u0027that bad\u0027 and also suspected the royals would not have been able to help.The duke said: \u0027That was one of the biggest reasons to leave, feeling trapped and feeling controlled through fear, both by the media and by the system itself which never encouraged the talking about this kind of trauma. Certainly now I will never be bullied into silence.\u0027 Harry was also shown taking part in an eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy session with a trained professional.He said: \u0027Therapy has equipped me to be able to take on anything - that\u0027s why I\u0027m here now, that\u0027s why my wife is here now.\u0027His comments will no doubt have increased the much publicised tensions within the royal family following Harry and Meghan\u0027s bombshell interview with Oprah in March.In that programme the Sussexes first accused the royal family of not supporting them, claimed royal aides declined to help Meghan when she was troubled with suicidal thoughts and said a relative had made a racist comment about their son\u0027s skin colour. Hours before the new show aired, Harry joined his brother the Duke of Cambridge in criticising the BBC following an inquiry which found the broadcaster covered up \u0027deceitful behaviour\u0027 used by journalist Martin Bashir to secure his headline-making 1995 interview with their mother. The series comes after Harry appeared to suggest his father and grandparents, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, had all failed as parents during a podcast interview broadcast earlier in May. "},{"url":null,"title":"Hilarious moment fisherman doesnt spot school rays sneaking past Florida beach shallows","story":"Share this article Cownose stingrays are named for their distinctly shaped head, which when observed from above can resemble a cow\u0027s nose. While they do vary in size, a large fish can grow up to 45 inches and weigh more than 50 pounds.  They possess a poisonous stinger at the base of their tails, but because they are \u0027shy\u0027 they pose a \u0027minimal risk to humans\u0027 according to ocean conservation organisation Oceana. When migrating through the western Atlantic Ocean, schools or \u0027fevers\u0027 of rays can reach up to 10,000 strong."},{"url":null,"title":"Indian Covid variant dominant 42 areas England","story":"Share this article There is no proof the Indian variant is more lethal than older strains of the coronavirus but data shows it is more transmissible than the Kent type, which triggered Britain\u0027s devastating second wave before vaccines were rolled out. Experts believe B.1.617.2 is 30 per cent more infectious than B.1.1.7 — the name for the Kent strain — but won\u0027t get any concrete data for at least another week.Professor Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, suggested the pandemic could be declared over in the UK if people are kept out of hospital by vaccines. He said: \u0027The thing that makes this a pandemic is people going into hospital. \u0027And so what we really need to know, and we don\u0027t have the data yet for certain, is how well both the vaccines are performing in preventing people from going into hospital.\u0027And what we\u0027ve seen so far in the pandemic is that protection from vaccines against hospitalisation and death is much, much higher than the protection against mild infection, which is what these tests are detecting.\u0027So what I\u0027m waiting for is the answer to that exam question, which is the critical one to understand how we should respond in the future to new variants, is to find out whether these infections that we\u0027re starting to see a little bit with this current variant are completely uncoupled from hospitalisations and deaths.\u0027But we just need a few more weeks to get more evidence around that.\u0027On whether booster vaccines will be needed, Professor Pollard said work was ongoing to make new vaccines in case they were needed — but it was not certain that they would be.He urged people to have their second jab and said coronavirus will find the unvaccinated, adding that the Indian variant was able to spread \u0027slightly better\u0027 whether people have been vaccinated or not.\u0027Of course this is the variant that\u0027s around at the moment but future variants are going to get even better at doing that,\u0027 Professor Pollard said.\u0027That\u0027s the evolution of this virus, that it\u0027s going to find ways around immune responses to be able to spread a bit better.\u0027And so that gives a really important public health message, which is that if you\u0027re unvaccinated, then the virus will eventually find those iniduals in the population who are unvaccinated, and of course if you\u0027re over 50 and unvaccinated, you\u0027re at much greater risk of severe disease.\u0027 His comments came after experts at the Government\u0027s world-renowned Porton Down research centre concluded that the current crop of jabs work against B.1.617.2.Data revealed Pfizer\u0027s vaccine was 88 per cent effective against the Indian variant in preventing symptoms after two doses, compared with 93 per cent against the Kent strain. AstraZeneca\u0027s was given a figure of 60 per cent, compared with 66 per cent against the Kent variant.Asked if people may think the AstraZeneca vaccine was not as good, Professor Pollard said: \u0027Well I think in some ways we\u0027re looking at the wrong exam question, because this is a question about mild infection and transmission.\u0027Other experts said the difference between the two jabs could be down to the fact that the rollout of second doses of AstraZeneca was later than that for Pfizer, and it takes longer to reach maximum effectiveness. Because it was easier to transport, the AstraZeneca jab was also given to older people who are most at risk of falling ill. "},{"url":null,"title":"PPE firm boss blasts ministers VIP lane large contracts","story":"Share this article A Freedom of Information probe by the Sunday Times discovered National Audit Office emails showing that last May, at the height of the first Covid lockdown, he lobbied the Government on behalf of a Hong Kong firm.After a string of email exchanges with Mr Hancock and his senior aides the company was awarded a £178million deal in June.But Mr Hancock angrily defended his conduct, saying it was \u0027absolutely appropriate for anybody to get in contact with anybody at the Department of Health when the country desperately needed PPE\u0027.Last November a devastating report lifted the lid on cronyism and ineptitude in the programme that saw the Government spend £18billion on PPE and other equipment during the coronavirus crisis.Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings were both drawn into the debacle after the spending watchdog said officials failed to consider potential conflicts of interests involving companies linked to them.The National Audit Office revealed that officials had signed contracts for hundreds of thousands of facemasks which turned out to be unusable – wasting hundreds of millions of pounds."},{"url":null,"title":"Britain records 2 439 Covid cases positive tests spike nearly quarter week","story":"Share this article It also emerged today that British holidaymakers can visit 18 European countries on the \u0027amber list\u0027 without having to quarantine upon arrival.It comes as tourists faced fresh confusion after Spain welcomed Britons despite being on the UK Government\u0027s \u0027amber list\u0027, while France prepares to impose tougher restrictions on travellers.Passengers returning to Britain from amber list countries must stay at home for ten days and take a PCR test on days two and eight — as well as a lateral flow test before the return flight.

So, led by the pub’s resident drag queen, Baroness Mary Golds, the team decided to try streaming their cabaret show live on Facebook. The first one received such rave reviews that they ran another the following night, this time including a link to a GoFundMe page. “We still had costs even though the pub was standing empty,” says Burnett. “I was expecting we’d raise £1,000 over four or five weeks but we reached £1,000 on that first night, thanks to the way our customers supported us.” Buoyed by the overwhelming response, the team continued to broadcast drag shows four times a week, raising close to £16,000, much of which went to local charities and causes. “We’ve raised almost £7,000 for charities like Homeless Hope, which looks after the feet of the homeless. We’ve also sent ‘love bundles’ to performers, because performing arts – and the performers themselves – have been hit hard by Covid. “Mary was very much a hero, performing four nights a week – and bear in mind these people weren’t getting paid. We really were in this together.” When it came to reopening the pub in April, customers were greeted by major changes, coordinated by bar manager Evan Perkins. “We revamped the bar area, created a bigger outside space and have sanitisers at every entry and exit point, and around the building,” says Burnett. Performers lead customers to the tables outside, while explaining the regulations. For now, the cabaret performances continue to be streamed from an upstairs room while they make arrangements for when live entertainment can resume. “Mary says she’s going to cry the first time she hears a live round of applause – at the moment we have fake applause at the end of each song or joke,” says Burnett. He says the response from regulars has been incredible. “I was due to leave at the end of the year – I’d said after five years I’d move on – but the community has supported us through the worst year in history for hospitality, so how can I leave now? “Yesterday, I walked into the beer garden and it was blowing a gale but was full of people sat there in raincoats, getting soaked. They just raised their glasses and went ‘cheers’. It says a lot about how much they value this place.” “The last year has been incredibly hard but having nearly lost my business during the recession, I knew I could get through difficult times again. I’ve run the salon since 2002 and there’s 10 of us here. The salon means different things to people – for some, it’s just a haircut but for others it’s a community. Some customers come several times a week because they aren’t physically able to do their hair at home, so they really rely on us. “I think this past year has made people realise how important their local salon is – the relationships they’ve built and how that impacts on how they feel. “Being told we were closing was devastating but I took the mindset of ‘this isn’t going to beat me’. I furloughed everybody except my managing director and as I was already a business coach helping other salons, I used the time to write a book sharing advice for salon owners, as well as putting on free business events. “The two of us communicated as much as we could with our team and clients, running Facebook quizzes and sharing pictures on social media of us growing out our roots for example, reminding clients we were still very much with them. “Before reopening, the team went through infection control training and we put in a sanitising station and implemented things like PPE. We also added a doorbell so people can’t just walk in, and put signs on the floor saying where to stand and walk. “It’s been tough, but everybody has adapted brilliantly. Hairdressers are so passionate about what they do, we’ve really missed the creativity of it all.” “One of our most important goals for these first few months, and shows, is making the audience feel as comfortable as we can. “We’ve bought thermal imaging cameras to take everyone’s temperature as they enter the theatre, which can read 30 people per second. If someone’s temperature is too high, we’ll wait a few minutes and check them with a handheld thermometer. “Unfortunately, if they still have a high temperature, we’ll have to refund them their ticket as we have to maintain safety for everybody involved. “Our cafe has been open since we were allowed to reopen for takeaway, and we will start offering socially distanced indoor dining in our cafe on the week of 17 May. The first two shows are on the 18th and 19th, and the audience and staff will still have to wear face coverings. “This will be our 135th anniversary season. It’s been tough, but we still have hope. “There are a lot of rules backstage, too. Things like the green room have changed –we had one for everyone, but now it’s for visiting companies and we have facilities elsewhere for our staff.” “We’ve actually made quite a few changes since lockdown. Something I realised I was missing was the interaction with people. Before Covid, we were predominantly a sourdough bakery with a seating area, where we served lunches very much based on local produce. “When the cafe had to close we decided to reduce the amount of seating, move bread sales in there and expand our range of products. By moving things round we made a larger space for people, and we built a pantry area with lots of ingredients for things that people could recreate at home. We also invested in a large retail fridge to stock Irish cheeses. “It has a very honest and open feel, and we’re able to have that connection with our customers that I’d been missing. That said, we have sanitiser at the door and counter, and ask people to pay by card when possible. “Our delivery van is used by more than one member of staff, so it has been kitted out with sanitiser and gloves. We also try to minimise the number of staff who are working at close quarters on shift. “When we could only serve takeaway, we realised that people had the habit of getting a loaf and some sweet things and heading off for a picnic. Because of there being more takeaway we had to invest in packaging, we went for the compostable type. I’m surrounded by boxes of boxes! “In terms of opening more fully, we’re waiting for confirmation on whether we’ll have to do table service once people can eat inside, and when we know we’ll arrange the seating accordingly. “It’s strange because everybody is going to open at the same time, but we’re so lucky as our customers are so loyal.” We can all play our part in keeping each other safe.

She said the home secretary had to take into account possible national security concerns.He says “thanks to corruption in the police and interference by News UK, the family have had no justice”. That shames us, he says. He says Priti Patel, the home secretary, has blocked publication of the report because she wants to review it. He says she has no power in law to do that. He asks the government to agree a date for the report’s publication. He says it is not difficult to see why people with close friends in News International might want to delay or prevent publication.

Feelings of self-doubt and a sudden lack of confidence consumed me. Like many people, I’ve been wondering how to actually socialise again. My anxiety levels have skyrocketed. Lockdown has played tricks with my ego and confidence. The question has been what to do about it. As a busy mum-of-three, I don’t exactly have bags of spare time. During lockdown I’d become intrigued by TikTok. I’d looked at some of the uplifting videos that had gone viral and grabbed the whole world’s attention. But I sensed there was more to TikTok than just dance fads. Could its wealth of videos about every subject under the sun help me regain my social skills and self-confidence? I start my exploration of motivational TikTok videos by granting myself permission for some basic “me time”. Given my hectic schedule, I’ve never really been one for so-called “me time” – but watching and listening to some everyday women with little sprinklings of genius on TikTok really made me stop and think: hold on, it is actually about me. “You can’t give to your family from an empty cup,” explains TikTok creator @ivanarichey – one of her many short and snappy pearls of wisdom. I scoffed at it at first, and thought what a cliche. But then I realised that, actually, if I go down, then pretty much the whole ship goes down too. From then on, whenever I could grab five minutes in between the school run and dinnertime, I’d have a quick browse at some other motivational accounts to give me that extra perk I needed to make it through to bedtime. “Compliment yourself, praise yourself,” says TikTok creator @spencer.barbosa, whose motivational gems and quick and quirky style tips will perk you up in an instant. Another of her quotes that I loved was: “You don’t have to be the best, just be the best version of yourself.” I don’t know what it was that made me more receptive to heeding advice in this format. It could have been the sincerity and authenticity of the TikTok creators themselves. It could have been their uplifting vibe or disarming humour. Or it could have been the snappy, no-nonsense format. But pretty soon, I was hooked. I honestly hadn’t actually realised until now just how important and effective it is to consciously lift yourself up, dust off that crown, and so on. Suddenly, the prospect of seeing my friends and socialising again after nearly 18 months didn’t seem so daunting. One of the things I used to love doing before lockdown was get a makeover in the lead-up to a glam event. Given that this has not been an option for quite some time, I wondered if I’d ever be glam again and didn’t want to shock people when they saw me in person. I realised I was a far cry from my filtered image on social media. So I started scrolling for quick makeovers for those of us with not much time to spare. And @thepatriciabright was just the tonic I needed to give me the lift to get my face back on and get back out there. Her videos were great for providing seemingly instant glam, and they were so funny, too – especially when she teamed up with her hubby for a parody clip. It’s amazing what a sprinkling of gold dust over your cheekbones can do. And makeup artist @dominiqueallison taught me some awesome mum tricks to hide those bags by putting a slick of concealer on over your foundation. She also whipped up some funky retro looks for when we are allowed to go #outout again. I’m also a big fan of videos posted by @jaimykoroma and @werejagreeneyes, which had me in hysterics with her life hacks in ultra-short, 10-second videos.

It is the latest in a slew of controversies that have affected Whitmer during the coronavirus pandemic, as critics watch for behavior at odds with policies and public messaging. “Yesterday, I went with friends to a local restaurant,” Whitmer said in a statement on Sunday. “As more people arrived, the tables were pushed together. Because we were all vaccinated, we didn’t stop to think about it. “In retrospect, I should have thought about it. I am human. I made a mistake, and I apologize.” After devastating Covid-19 surges in Michigan over the winter and this spring, daily cases are finally dropping, though the state remains a center for new infections by population.  “It’s not hyperbole to suggest you save people’s lives,” the president told the FEMA staffers, per the White House press pool.  Journalists at the Associated Press published an open letter on Monday, decrying the decision to fire Emily Wilder, a young employee targeted by a Republican smear campaign regarding her pro-Palestinian advocacy while a student. “It has left our colleagues – particularly emerging journalists – wondering how we treat our own, what culture we embrace and what values we truly espouse as a company,” the journalists wrote. Wilder, a 2020 Stanford graduate, was an intern at the Arizona Republic before the AP hired her for an entry-level role in Phoenix. She announced her new position in April, tweeting photographs which showed her wearing an AP logo. She started as a news associate in early May but was fired weeks later – according to the company, for violating its social media policy. She and other AP staffers remain confused as to how. Congressman Dean Phillips said on Twitter, “I’ll say the quiet part out loud it’s time for ‘progressives’ to start condemning anti-semitism and violent attacks on Jewish people with the same intention and vigor demonstrated in other areas of activism. The silence has been deafening.” At least 26 anti-Semitic incidents have been reported in the past two weeks, according to the Washington Post. Violence increased as Israeli forces and Hamas launched attacks at each other in Gaza, where a ceasefire has now been called. The attacks killed more than 200 people, most of them Palestinian. A number of progressives criticized Joe Biden for being too lenient with Israel as the country’s military continued to launch airstrikes in Gaza.The president reiterated his administration’s announcement that it will invest $1 billion to help communities prepare for future natural disasters. “It’s going to help communities, including those too often overlooked, and it’s going to invest in resilience and better protect themselves to serve other climate events they’re going to be facing,” Biden said of the funding. “And so it’s about, not about red states and blue states, you all know that, it’s about having people’s backs at the toughest moments that they face, ready with food, water and shelter and more.”  Homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and national climate adviser Gina McCarthy are among those in attendance for the briefing.Ahead of the president’s FEMA visit, the Biden administration announced today that it is investing $1 billion toward helping communities prepare for natural disasters. “As climate change threatens to bring more extreme events like increased floods, sea level rise, and intensifying droughts and wildfires, it is our responsibility to better prepare and support communities, families, and businesses before disaster – not just after,” the White House said.Thanking the soldiers and airmen, Austin – a retired general himself – said: “These airmen and soldiers protected not only the grounds, but the lawmakers working on those grounds, ensuring the people’s business could continue unabated. They lived out in very tangible ways the oath they took to support and defend the constitution.” Such ways the national guardsmen and women supported and protected the constitution might seem more tangible, one might say, than any pursued by Republicans in the House and Senate opposed to the establishment of a 911-style commission to investigate 6 January. Austin also noted the guard’s work in coping with “natural disasters, civil unrest and an ongoing pandemic” and said: “As these troops depart for home and a much-deserved reunion with loved ones, I hope they do so knowing how much the nation appreciates their service and sacrifice – and that of their families and employers.” Since last summer, the city has been hit by two major hurricanes, a paralyzing deep freeze, and now flooding rainfall that has inundated hundreds of homes. The latest disaster, which saw 15in of rain in just 12 hours, left people navigating the streets by kayak, salvaging what they could from homes still being patched up from hurricane damage and wondering if the past year is an omen of a deepening climate crisis. “We are a very resilient people, we are a very strong population,” said Nic Hunter, Lake Charles’ mayor, whose staff had scrambled to rescue electronics from a flooding city hall. His own children were marooned at school. “But, you know, eventually you do kind of get to a point where you ask Mother Nature: what more can you do to us?” As the Associated Press reports, “the $1bn in spending is a small fraction of what the US spends on weather-related disasters. Last year alone, the nation endured 22 separate weather and climate-related disasters with losses greater than $1bn each. The disasters, including wildfires, hurricanes and snowstorms, had a cumulative price tag of nearly $100bn.” Furthermore, “2021 has already had significant winter storms that caused a deadly blackout in Texas and other states and underscore the damage caused by climate change. Forecasters predict the Atlantic hurricane season will be busier than normal, but is unlikely to be as severe as 2020’s record-shattering year. “The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said last week that the hurricane season, which runs from June through November, will likely see 13 to 20 named storms, including at least six that will become hurricanes and three to five categorized as major hurricanes with winds of more than 110mph. “Biden will make the funding announcement during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s headquarters on Monday afternoon, where he will receive a briefing on this year’s outlook for the Atlantic hurricane season.” Biden has sent his secretary of state, Tony Blinken, to the Middle East this week, saying in a statement: “Following up on our quiet, intensive diplomacy to bring about a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas … Blinken will meet with Israeli leaders about our ironclad commitment to Israel’s security. He will continue our administration’s efforts to rebuild ties to, and support for, the Palestinian people and leaders, after years of neglect.” Jewish and Arab Americans were among signatories to the open letter to Biden. Among its demands, it says the Biden administration must “investigate whether Israel’s most recent assault on Gaza violates the Leahy Law, prohibiting US military aid from funding foreign military units implicated in the commission of gross violations of human rights”. Here’s some further reading: The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.The White House press secretary said the administration is eagerly anticipating Republicans’ counteroffer on infrastructure after Joe Biden proposed a slightly smaller bill than what he had originally proposed. Administration officials said on Friday that they had proposed a $1.7 trillion package to Republicans, after Biden initially called for spending $2.25 trillion on infrastructure. However, Republicans have indicated the latest offer is still too costly. They have insisted the package should be more narrowly focused on traditional infrastructure issues like improving roads and bridges. The White House press secretary said the president is “still very hopeful” that he will be able to sign the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Biden had originally said that he hoped to sign the bill by the one-year anniversary, which is tomorrow, but lawmakers continue to negotiate over the legislation. The president is scheduled to meet with Floyd’s family tomorrow to commemorate the anniversary. Psaki said it would be a “private meeting,” but she noted the White House will put out a statement to mark the anniversary.Psaki opened her comments with a joke that today’s briefing is “double the fun” because the White House has doubled the number of reporters allowed in the room.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

File photograph: Alan BetsonA rise in Covid-19 infections in Limerick is leading to a surge in the number of people seeking tests for the virus in the county as the number of people in hospital has increased.Some 920 people had sought coronavirus tests in the HSE’s walk-in centres in Limerick by 5pm on Monday compared with 526 at the same time last week, a 75 per cent increase. Niamh O’Beirne, the HSE’s national lead on testing and contract tracing, said that Covid-19 tests were seeing “very high footfall” of people through testing sites in Limerick.There were 1,437 people seeking tests in Limerick on Saturday and Sunday compared with 804 the previous weekend as symptomatic and asymptomatic people checked to see if they are infected.Referrals for tests from GPs have been prevented due to the cyberattack on the HSE. The rate for people testing positive stood at 6.3 per cent in Limerick compared with a national average of 4 per cent. Health officials urged Limerick people to work from home as local cases of surged to almost 260 in the past week, according to the Department of Public Health Mid-West.A free pop-up walk-in testing centre is to be provided from 12pm-7pm, on the grounds of St Joseph’s Hospital, Mulgrave Street for five days initially from this Wednesday.A spokesman for University Hospital Limerick (UHL) said the amount of inpatient Covid-19 cases had increased from two to 12 in the past week.Dr Mai Mannix, director of public health midwest, said her contact tracing team in Limerick had seen a growing number of cases emerging from a rise in large indoor social gatherings including house parties, birthday parties, end of year academic celebrations and the recent Eid festivities.“We are seeing young adults, people in their 30s and 40s who are parents of young children, being hospitalised. Luckily, obviously our older age group is now immunised, so we are not seeing that group being hospitalised or infected to any large extent,” she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. A source at UHL said a number of patients in the hospital’s intensive care unit were in the younger adult age bracket, which was concerning.Dr Mannix said she had not seen this level of infection in Limerick since early March and that if daily cases keep rising, coupled with the strain from dealing with the cyberattack on the HSE, the health service would find itself “in a very troubling position”.Limited figures released by the Department of Health due to the cyberattack showed 345 new cases of Covid-19 were reported nationally, though this figure could be later revised.There were 127 people in hospital with the virus, of whom 44 are in intensive care. The virus positivity rate on testing is high in other parts of country, at 6 per cent in Ballymun and 5.3 per cent in Blanchardstown, Dublin and 5.3 per cent in Letterkenny, Co Donegal. Contact tracers and public health officials reported new cases among younger people and students as a result of social gatherings to mark the end of academic year or the end of exams. In a further recovery from the cyberattack, the HSE will recommence assigning automatic appointments for close contacts of Covid-19 cases rather directing them to visit a testing centre. Close contacts will be directed to attend “day zero” and “day 10” appointments for tests.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"people from as far as offaly are making the most of changes to the north s covid rules","story":"Caffé Fresco open for indoor dining in Strabane, Co Tyrone.

Photograph:   Joe Dunne Philip and Patricia Casey from Shannonbridge, Co Offaly, with their daughter Ciara   in Caffé Fresco. Photograph:   Joe Dunne Monday was a big day for three-month-old Teagan McGonagle. “It’s her first time in a cafe,” explains her mother Rachel McGlinchey. “She’s a lockdown baby.” Wide-eyed she watches the other customers, her gaze following the waiters and waitresses as they pass by delivering food to other tables. “She doesn’t know any different,” says her mother, “but she’s my first child, and it has been hard. We couldn’t get out and meet people.” At Caffé Fresco in Strabane, Co Tyrone, the rest of the diners are equally delighted to be out. “If you get the chance to have a cup of coffee brought to you, you don’t refuse it,” says Edith Ramsey from Derry. She is with her son and daughter Ivor and Lee-ann on what is their first day out post-lockdown. “It feels like a bit of normality,” says Lee-ann. “It’s great to be able to get out and support local businesses as well,” adds Ivor. “People have been struggling. It’s right we should be out and helping them.” On Monday Northern Ireland took another significant step out of lockdown with the reopening of indoor hospitality and the rest of the tourism industry, including indoor visitor and cultural attractions. The ban on meeting in homes has also been lifted, with up to six people from no more than two households allowed to meet in domestic settings indoors. It is a marked difference from the situation only a mile or so over the Border in Lifford, Co Donegal, where the hospitality industry is still limited to takeaway only and indoor attractions remain closed. At the cafe, people from as far afield as Co Offaly have been making the most of the change in the rules in the North. “We’re from across the Border,” says Sheila McGlinchey from Buncrana, Co Donegal. “There’s still no inside dining it’s still takeaway only. But at least we can go into the North now without feeling like we might be stopped.” Novelty The Casey family from Shannonbridge, Co Offaly, are on their way home from a weekend with friends near Strabane. “We couldn’t wait,” says Patricia Casey. “This is our first time outside our 5k in practically a year and a half – we’ve been nowhere. “It’s such a novelty being in a cafe – at home you can still only get takeout. But we walked in the door, we were asked to sanitise our hands, and brought straight to our table – it was perfect.” “It’s such a relief to be able to meet people, to be able to sit down and just have a chat. It’s just a part of who we are.” Outside the café the owner Trevor Mealiff is hard at work removing the marquee that for the last few weeks has provided a temporary cover for customers while outdoor dining-only was permitted. Instead he and the neighbouring shops have banded together to get funding for a permanent Perspex cover over the pavement which will future-proof their outdoor dining space reopening after this latest lockdown, he says, was easier as all the public health measures were already in place. DiversifyHe worked hard to ersify during lockdown and used his last remaining funds to buy a pizza oven so he could sell takeaway pizza three nights a week at one stage he had £275 left in the bank to keep the business afloat. Some of the changes will stay. The cafe will not go back to restaurant dining at night, but will keep selling pizzas, not least because of the difficulty finding chefs. “So many have gone off and found different jobs during lockdown. I know chefs who are now postmen and delivery drivers,” says Mealiff. Yet as he watches the steady flow of customers in and out of the cafe, he is hopeful. “I genuinely can’t see us going back into lockdown again.” And he is confident of a good summer for Ireland’s hospitality industry. “Put it this way, no one will be going on holiday abroad this year.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"pilot live events to take place in june and july minister confirms","story":"The Government will make an announcement on reopening plans on Friday. Photograph: iStockPilot live events of varying sizes will take place across the country in June and July including rock, classical and comedy gigs as well both indoor and outdoor theatre events.Minister for Tourism, Culture and Arts Catherine Martin said she was working on the finer details of the pilot events such as whether the tickets will go on general release and if antigen testing will have a role.“I’m compiling a list of a number of live events right across the country to cover a variety of music genres from rock to classical and also comedy and of course theatre, indoors and outdoors. The numbers will vary according to the type of the event or the venue,” Ms Martin said.While she said that she could not speculate on the exact numbers that would be in attendance, it is understood they will vary between the low hundreds and more than 1,000.“I think these these live events are key to to reopening for a sector that has been absolutely devastated and I want to see their doors open for good and people earn a living again.”Ms Martin said she was also working on test events in sports alongside Minister of State Jack Chambers.“I would like to see some of these events in June so my hope is June and July,” she said of the timing adding: “the sooner the better in order to get to a reopening”.Ms Martin was speaking at the launch of In Form, a two-year collaboration between the National Museum of Ireland and the Design and Crafts Council Ireland.Earlier, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the reopening of major sectors over the next two months would be “steady”.The Government will make an announcement on reopening plans on Friday, with much anticipation around dates for travel, indoor hospitality and live events.Two Cabinet meetings will take place later this week where the National Public Health Emergency Team’s (Nphet) latest public health advice will be considered.“We will outline what is possible, what we feel is possible for June and July in respect of travel for example, in respect for hospitality, and indeed live entertainment and the arts,” Mr Martin told the Today with Claire Byrne programme.“We may try some events in June and then see what’s possible in July, but we will take Nphet’s advice.“It’s steady as she goes to the end of this month, it’ll be steady in June. We’ll see what’s possible in July.”While it is hoped indoor hospitality in restaurants and pubs will be allowed to resume in early July, Mr Martin cast some doubt on the exact dates.“I think people need just to hold it and I can understand people from different sectors, they’re suffering and it’s had a huge negative impact, they have lost a lot of income, they haven’t worked,” Mr Martin added.“For the summer, outdoors is best and indoor has been challenging from the get-go.“I think let’s make the progress we’re making and continue to make it.“That gives everybody the best guarantee of a more sustained opening into the future.”Digital green certificateThe Government is also set to give further consideration this week to the EU digital green certificate allowing foreign travel.Under the proposals, people will receive a digital pass that can be scanned at an airport, indicating they have either been vaccinated, produced a negative Covid-19 test or have recovered from the virus.The move, to be signed off by EU leaders at the meeting this week, could pave the way for summer holidays.It is due to be introduced on July 1st, but member states will have the option of a six-week grace period before implementing the measures.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said he hoped Ireland would give effect to the initiative at some point in July.“I hope that Ireland can be an early adopter, from when this is introduced on July 1st,” Mr Coveney said.“I don’t expect it to take effect from the first of July but I certainly hope that we will be able to benefit from removing restrictions on international travel for many people who are travelling, perhaps not everybody, but for many people at some point in July.“We will be making decisions on that and giving more clarity in relation to it on Friday.”Ms Martin also said that Ireland should be aiming to implement the pending EU green cert as soon as possible.If it can be done within a fortnight of its planned EU start date, which is the end of June, then it should be, she said.“If it can be done then that’s what we should be aiming for, but it all depends on public health advice. I know that inbound tourism is crucial. We launched the domestic tourism campaign last week and that was worth maybe €2.5 billion before Covid, but it cannot replace international tourism, it’s crucial to the industry and I know that from my engagement with them so I’d be advocating for that.”Asked if travel to the UK and US should be allowed under the same conditions when the green cert is approved, she indicated that this could be further out in the timeline.“It depends on what is safe to do. American tourists coming in is crucial so as soon as we can open up and it’s safe to do so, I’m advocating for that. But that might be a little more further away than EU travel.” Additional reporting: – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ucd student to live in campervan due to unaffordable rent","story":"Conni Dawson in her camper van in Co Clare.

It’s four years and I don’t know if I’ll manage all four years in it but I genuinely cannot afford rent in Dublin,” she said.‘Exhausting’“As I was at my parents’ house during Covid I’m also not eligible for funding for university . . . if I wasn’t in the van then I just wouldn’t go as I’m not willing to take out a loan to pay for housing for four years.“I’m hoping, as UCD has quite a lot of onsite parking, that I can park there during the day and then just need to drive out and find somewhere to park it for the night and then drive back into university. It’s going to be exhausting. I would much rather have a house but it’s just not doable.“It’s going to be a lot of moving about and planning where I’m going next.”Ms Dawson said she did some travelling in the campervan last summer and found that Ireland “isn’t exactly the friendliest of places” for van life.“I’ve friends over in the UK and they get on grand with it but there’s always that connotation here of, ‘Oh are you one of the Travellers’, and they can be a bit unfriendly,” she said. “So you try and be inconspicuous as best you can so you don’t stay on any spot too long.”Ms Dawson said while the campervan can be cold at times, she feels great comfort in owning where she lives.“For all that it is a little bit unusual and it is tricky on some things, I do actually feel a lot more comfortable in this than renting an apartment because this is mine and there’s a lot of comfort to be had in that.“If I could get something, for €300 or €400 a month I would rent, but it’s just not affordable, especially not on student money.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"wearing of masks may be necessary into winter donnelly","story":" Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly: ‘It will be some time yet before there is a sufficient level of the entire population fully vaccinated.’ Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe State needs to be able to impose emergency public health restrictions into late autumn or early winter, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said as the Seanad debated extending them until November 9th.Mr Donnelly said the wearing of masks into winter may be necessary in “higher-risk environments” or if there are local outbreaks of Covid-19 or of variants.He added that “it will be some time yet before there is a sufficient level of the entire population fully vaccinated” and information was “incomplete” on the impact of variants on the vaccines.The Minister was speaking during a Seanad debate on amending legislation to allow Covid-19 restrictions be re-imposed quickly if deemed necessary.He said that “we are ahead of the best-case scenario” that had been predicted and “we are in a good position” as the Government prepares to outline its proposals on Friday for further easing of restrictions and the re-opening of international travel.The Government backs the digital green certification and “people who are fully vaccinated can travel” not just in the EU but “with partner countries outside the EU as well”. It would mean “no home quarantine” on return from such travel.‘Lighter touch’Mr Donnelly said he hoped the emergency public health measures would not be necessary but if they were that it would be the “lighter touch measures” including wearing masks that might be required.Mr Donnelly said “we have made significant progress in suppressing the spread of this virus but we are not out of the woods yet and he warned that the trajectory of the Covid-19 virus is “precarious”.He also said there is considerable uncertainty over what measures would be needed for the rest of the year.The Seanad voted by 29 to three to pass the second state of the legislation to extend the ability of the State to impose restrictions at short notice until November 9th and then to extend them every three months by a resolution of the Seanad and Dáil.While Government as well as opposition Senators criticised the measures, just three Senators – Independents Michael McDowell Sharon Keogan and Rónán Mullen – voted against them.Green Party Senator Vincent P Martin disagreed that the restrictions should be extended to November and said “we need to move away from draconian restrictions and reclaim our sense of freedom and autonomy. We must harness hope and let optimism triumph over pessimism.”‘Political courage’Fine Gael Senator Barry Ward said the Government had missed the opportunity to address amendments in the legislation, “that simply do not work”, including errors linked to Garda powers to deal with house parties.Mr McDowell called for “political courage” to ensure that every Senator, TD and their staff were vaccinated as quickly as possible so that “we can resume normal business and have normal scrutiny of parliamentary activity as the Constitution requires”.Labour Senator Annie Hoey called for a human rights analysis of the restrictions and said the measures should not be renewed “without vigorous debate and scrutiny”.Sinn Féin Senator Niall O Donnghaile said the Minister should return to the House in late June or July to seek to extend the powers if necessary as part of an overall strategy because “we don’t see a clear plan coming from the Government yet”.Ms Keogan said the open-endedness of the Bill meant the restrictions “may be permitted by law on a continual and potentially perpetual basis” which she said was no longer “necessary or proportionate”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"swann seeks meeting with donnelly over cross border travel","story":"The North’s health minister Robin Swann (left)  and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. Photographs:  Kelvin BoyesPA Wire and Alan BetsonThe The North’s Minister for Health has criticised his counterpart in the Republic for failing to meet him to discuss concerns around cross-Border and international travel. Robin Swann said it was “disappointing” that the Republic’s Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly had “encouraged our officials to meet” rather than taking part himself. Earlier on Monday, speaking on BBC Radio Ulster’s Nolan Show, Mr Swann said there was “still concern about travel from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland” and he had asked for a meeting with Mr Donnelly to discuss this and “to see what we could do jointly with regard to messaging”. However he said that “unfortunately I have been unable to secure that meeting with Stephen Donnelly yet ... it was over a fortnight ago, now he has encouraged our officials to meet – they do anyway, they meet regularly at chief medical officer level and our public health authority level.” Mr Swann said this was “disappointing, I reported it back to the Executive and they expressed their disappointment as well that that was the reaction we received.” A spokesman for Mr Donnelly said the Minister “has ongoing engagement with Minister Swann, and responded to his most recent letter saying that there should be continued further engagement at official level ahead of a ministerial meeting. “Officials met again as recently as Friday last, to discuss in particular the variant first discovered in India.” The spokesman added: “Minister Donnelly intends to have a meeting with Minister Swann this week if possible.”Mr Swann’s concerns were echoed by the North’s First Minister, Arlene Foster, on Monday, who said discussions were needed between Ministers on both sides of the Border. She said there needed to be a conversation around the prevalence of the Indian variant and “around cross-Border travel because over these past few weeks our highest incidence is in Londonderry and Strabane, therefore we need to try and understand that. “The only way to do that is have a meeting,” Ms Foster said. “We were disappointed when Stephen Donnelly came back and said that he wasn’t going to meet but his officials were going to meet. “Really this requires ministerial leadership and I do hope that he reconsiders on that.”The North’s Deputy First Minister, Michelle O’Neill, said that throughout the pandemic “the joined up-ness across the island hasn’t been where it should have been” and said it was “unfortunate that Stephen Donnelly hasn’t made time to meet with Robin Swann”. She said she would “encourage that meeting to happen” and the issue would be raised with the Taoiseach, adding that while there had been engagement with the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and others, “I do think that we need to have health-minister-to-health-minister conversation around what is the current state of play, what can we do together? “There are issues in Border counties, so can we do more together around collective messaging?” she said. In the Republic, the Department of Health reported 345 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday, while 53 were recorded in the North. – Additional reporting: PA.

Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko: Strategically, the timing of the incident is deeply risky, as EU leaders can co-ordinate a response on Monday. Photograph: Pavel OrlovskiyEPABelarusian autocrat Alexander Lukashenko’s timing in forcing down a Ryanair flight to seize a journalist who was on board has provided European Union foreign policy with a make-or-break moment.A false bomb threat and the escort of a Belarusian fighter plane forced the flight from Athens to land before it could reach its destination in Lithuania. One passenger was the 26-year-old dissident reporter Roman Protasevich, who had claimed asylum in the EU after exposing Belarusian regime brutality.He panicked as the flight began to descend to Minsk and told those around him that he would be executed, fellow passengers recall. His 23-year-old girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a student, was also detained, according to Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.The audacious act happened on the evening before a meeting of the 27 EU national leaders in Brussels. The timing and the shocking nature of the incident compelled the issue to the top of the leaders’ agenda.Strategically, the timing is deeply risky for Lukashenko. He has created the momentum, and the opportunity, for the 27 to quickly agree a tough response.Austria’s deputy ambassador to the EU Gregor Schusterschitz likened it to Napoleon Bonaparte’s mistake of returning from exile in Elba in 1815 at a moment when the great powers were gathered at the Congress of Vienna – “allowing them to co-ordinate swiftly their effective response”.Even the EU’s staunchest supporters agree this is a moment when the bloc badly needs to prove its foreign policy works, or even exists at all.Hungary’s roleForeign policy decisions require a unanimous agreement by the 27 member states. Elusive at the best of times, this configuration has been banjaxed by persistent Hungarian vetoes.Budapest’s pugnacious prime minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly wielded his veto to do favours for fellow authoritarians. He prevented a joint EU call for an Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire last week and blocked a statement of support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong the week before that, to name only the most recent interventions.As the leaders converge in the EU capital all eyes are now on the Hungarian delegation to see if Orban strikes again.If not, a number of options for EU responses are on the table. The most likely one is more sanctions. The EU has already imposed successive rounds of asset freezes and travel bans on top officials including Lukashenko for a 2020 election widely viewed as rigged to maintain his 26-year reign, and in response to the subsequent brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.Aviation agreementsAnother option is to suspend international aviation agreements that allow flights to enter or leave Belarusian air space, halting air traffic. This has been called for in a joint appeal by the heads of the parliamentary foreign affairs committees of Ireland, the United States, Britain, Germany, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, who described the incident as an “act of piracy” that “put the passengers and crew in grave danger”.This is not cost-free for the EU – the avoidance of conflict zones and difficult air space to the east already adds many miles to passenger flights in Europe.But the idea has a certain neatness and has significant support as a targeted response.The incident has quickly come to be seen as test case for the EU’s foreign policy, and a swift and stern response is seen as essential in order for the EU’s foreign policy to retain credibility.The strength of statements that emerged overnight, with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen calling it “outrageous and illegal” and Minister of State for European Affairs Thomas Byrne noting he had “never seen such anger” across the EU, is a reflection of that.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Russia thought to be behind Belarus flight hijack, says Dominic RaabHospitality bosses hit out after 6,000 capacity \u0026#39fan zone\u0026#39 approved in Glasgow despite Covid curbsBritain was against Joe Biden’s troop withdrawal from Afghanistan without conditions on the TalibanBBC accused of rehiring Martin Bashir without interview to ‘keep his mouth shut’Submarine telegram from 1851, thought to be world’s first, goes under the hammerSNP facing demands to fix Scotland\u0026#39s Covid vaccine booking system amid surge in missed appointmentsSNP \u0026#39ignores pay rules\u0026#39 to hand Labour peer £1,000 per day to lead misogyny reviewComment: ‘I’ve ripped up my TV licence!’ How the Martin Bashir scandal united MPs in disgustFocus on reducing Covid deaths ‘has come at massive cost’ to health, education and our libertyCoronavirus latest news: Global 2021 Covid deaths to exceed last year\u0026#39s in weeksForeign criminals to be barred from the UK under new electronic checks, Priti Patel pledgesMapped: The hotspots for the Indian variant of Covid-19 in the UKCovid lockdown roadmap: what you can and can\u0026#39t do as restrictions easeMonday evening UK news briefing: Death of Max Mosley, ex-F1 boss who waged tabloid warComment: You don\u0026#39t want to be on the wrong side of the home working ideDominic Cummings’s latest Covid accusations risk looking like the worst kind of hypocrisyAung San Suu Kyi defiant as she appears in court for first time since coupMother’s little helper: Ashes hero shares match-winning partnership with son, 12Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"blind mans sight restored 30 years world first gene editing","story":"A blind man who lost his sight nearly 40 years ago can see objects again after his eye cells were genetically modified to become sensitive to light. The 58-year-old had suffered from retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a condition in which the top layer of the retina degenerates so the eye can no longer sense light, for most of his adult life.Nearly 13 years ago, scientists theorised that intact ganglion cells at the bottom of the retina could be repurposed to become light-sensitive cells and take on the role of the damaged top layer.In a groundbreaking experiment, they genetically modified one eye by inserting genes from light-sensitive algae into the ganglion cells and triggered them using special goggles.The goggles record the world in real time and convert the image into pulses of red and amber light which shine into the retina, activating the cells, which connect to the optic nerve and restore sight.The treatment allowed the patient to recognise, count, locate and touch objects for the first time in decades. Prof Botond Roska, of the University of Basel in Switzerland, said: The retina is a biological computer at the back of your eye. It\u0027s like hamburger – the top bread is a photosensitive layer and the bottom bread forms the optic nerve and talks to the rest of our brain. In between, representing the salad, the tomato and meat, is the computational layers that computes the visual field.“In retinitis pigmentosa, the photosensitive layer is damaged but the rest is intact, like a hamburger without the top bread. In optogenetic therapy we create an artificial photosensitive layer targeting ganglion cells which are the lower bread. The brain has to learn a new language because the signals coming from the ganglion cells are not the usual signals.Retinitis pigmentosa affects one in 4,000 people in Britain – about 16,500 –and there is currently no treatment except for a gene replacement therapy that works only on an early-onset form of the disease to prevent further damage.The scientists believe the man\u0027s eyesight will continue to improve with more training. Treatment had to stop last year because of coronavirus, and several other patients are also currently undergoing the therapy.Prof José-Alain Sahel, of Sorbonne University in Paris, said: Before the treatment the patient couldn\u0027t see anything, but spontaneously he was able to see stripes on the street, and then was able to detect objects on the table and to grasp the objects and count the objects.We knew it was a very promising field, and obviously when you\u0027ve worked on something for so long and you have the first patient telling you they are seeing something, it\u0027s very exciting. It\u0027s a major milestone. The researchers believe blind patients will be keen to have the treatment because the gene insertion technique is simple, and the goggles are not intrusive.Prof Sahel added: I am convinced patients are going to use it because it\u0027s a very little invasive surgery, it\u0027s well tolerated so far. The new goggles are quite thin so everyone won\u0027t be looking at you in the street.It is a stepping stone. In the next five to 10 years, this will improve significantly. So I think it is like cars – you look back at last century cars and they are very different from the current BMWs.British scientists hailed the work but said more studies would be needed to find out if it could restore sight to a useful level for many people.James Bainbridge, professor of retinal sudies at University College London, said: This exciting new technology might help people whose eyesight is very severely impaired.It is a high-quality study. It is carefully conducted and controlled. The findings are based on laboratory tests in just one inidual. Further work will be needed to find out if the technology can be expected to provide useful vision. The intervention appeared to improve the ability to locate an object by sight.The research was published in the journal Nature Medicine.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"many syrians can dream future certain election result","story":"With less than a week to go before Syria\u0027s presidential election, Emad was giving little thought to politics or how to cast his vote.Instead, the engineering graduate was plotting an escape from spiralling rents, unemployment, and  shortages of fuel and food that he described as unbearable. I have little money to travel, but I have to leave, there’s nothing here for me anymore, he said in his flat in Western Damascus.  It’s becoming worse and worse, the bad economy, the falling currency, the growing corruption, the hard sanctions and only a small number of people are happy here, the country is only for the rich.”Syrians go to the polls on Wednesday to vote in a presidential election that the authorities here would like to present as a return to normality after a decade of devastating warfare.There is little doubt about the outcome of the election. Fifty-one candidates have been whittled down to three, and incumbent Bashar al-Assad shows no willingness to relinquish his grip on power after 21 years.But the dislocation of the war, foreign sanctions and a crisis in neighbouring Lebanon has sent the economy into meltdown.And a new wave of middle-class Syrians is hoping to flee  - despite the efforts of Assad\u0027s government to lure them back, and European countries to deter them.When I have sold what possessions I own, and my mother sells her jewellery, we will have to pay smugglers in Damascus, who will take me to Turkey and then on to Europe, said Emad.“It costs a minimum of $10,000 dollars, who has this amount? he says. But the choice is stay here and lose time in a terrible situation or try and borrow or find a solution and improve the situation, the basic components of a good life don’t exist in Syria any more for me, my family is now relying on me to provide for them in the future.”The conflict that broke out here in 2011 has killed more than 388,000 people and prompted more than half of Syria\u0027s pre-war population to flee their homes.  A record 12.4 million people, approximately 65 per cent of the Syrian population, are now food insecure. That figure has grown by 4.5 million in the space of a year.  But getting out is not easy.After the turmoil of the 2015 migrant crisis, in which 378,000 Syrians sought refuge in Europe, attitudes on the continent have hardened.Denmark earlier this year declared that Syria was a safe place for refugees to return to, despite ongoing repression and the risk of retribution many people say they will face if they return.In November last year, the Syrian authorities hosted an extravagant conference in Damascus seeking to lure back the more than six million refugees who left the country over the past ten years.Few seem willing to heed that call.Recent studies show that 90 percent of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt do not intend to return to Syria within the next year, even if they are unable to meet their basic needs in their host countries.In Damascus, the line between normality and chaos is often as narrow as a single road separating neighbourhoods.Some streets are so clean and tidy they could be in Switzerland, while nearby suburbs have been reduced to rows of destroyed buildings.The extreme contrast between the very wealthy - many of whom are acolytes of the Assad regime - and regular middle-class people is on display in every aspect of daily life.“Sometimes you can see the latest cars in the street, BMW’s and Range Rovers from 2021, with Syrian number plates. Most people would have to work 1000 years to buy them. The rest of the country struggles to eat meat and find basic services, hunger is everywhere,” said Doha Barakat, a student at Damascus University.For ordinary people, just finding the fuel to drive a car is a challenge. Queues for petrol fill streets as people wait for a weekly text message from a government-run services provider giving them a ration of just 25 litres of subsidised petrol.“I can’t bear it anymore, waiting hours on end for scarce petrol and I can’t even afford it, so to cut costs I have to walk,” said  Zakaraya Aboud, a 27-year-old trainee lawyer who now trudges 30 minutes in searing heat to get to work each day.“I’m going to try and move to Germany or France, by any means, even if it means I will be a refugee then so be it, I will have to sell my car to do it,” he added.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"milky way formed peacefully not collision another galaxy scientists","story":"The Milky Way formed billions of years ago as the result of a peaceful and natural process, a new study claims. It was thought that the Milky Way\u0027s thin and thick discs formed after a rare violent merger, and so probably wouldn\u0027t be found in other spiral galaxies.“Our research shows that\u0027s probably wrong, and it evolved naturally without catastrophic interventions.

But, health is more than one thing, and something that helped in one way may harm it in another.”The experts said the Government had focussed too heavily on mortality statistics without addressing the other problems associated with lockdown and restricting NHS services.Dominic Wilkinson, professor of medical ethics at the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics added: “One of the real dangers of a pandemic response is by directing our attention solely to one particular variable, we forsake these other costs and I think there\u0027s been massive other health costs of the pandemic response. “Now that might be justified. But we have to be clear that those costs exist, and, and we have to be transparent about that when we\u0027re making very difficult choices. We should remember that deaths and illnesses from other causes are also at stake.”Dr Sarah Chan, deputy director, Mason Institute for Medicine, Life Sciences and Law, University of Edinburgh, said the Government had tended to focus on measuring deaths because it was harder to quantify the impact on freedom or equality.“Measuring numerical values, especially when it comes to Covid-19 deaths has skewed attention away from the ethical values that should underpin our decisions,” she said.Newly released figures have also revealed that the Indian variant of Covid-19 now accounts for more than a third of cases in England, a five-fold rise in the strain\u0027s prevalence in just a fortnight.Random sampling of positive Covid-19 tests in the community analysed by Wellcome Sanger show that 37 per cent of cases were identified as B.1.617.2 (the technical name of the variant first identified in Indian) in the two weeks to May 15. That is compared to seven per cent in the two weeks to May 1, a significant spike in prevalence that suggests the Indian variant could soon become the dominant strain in England. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"parliament must not settling old scores","story":"Rarely has a former government official generated such a damaging political brouhaha as that being stirred up by Dominic Cummings. In a series of comments ahead of his appearance before a joint select committee hearing on Wednesday the Prime Minister’s former chief adviser has sought to create a narrative around Covid policy that portrays everyone but himself as incompetent.The self-indulgence of this exercise is stupefying. It seems designed to cause maximum damage to Boris Johnson for reasons that are personal rather than to illuminate the strategic mistakes of his government. Moreover, Mr Cummings fails to acknowledge that he was responsible for government communications throughout the pandemic. If there were confusing messages he was as responsible as anyone. He was a participant not an onlooker.Mr Cummings has been invited to give evidence to two select committees about the UK’s preparedness for the pandemic that hit last year. A parliamentary committee should not be used as a vehicle for vengeful retribution by a former official. As Jeremy Hunt, the former Cabinet minister and chairman of the health committee, said the proceedings must not be dominated by “political dirty washing or score-settling”. Yet friends of Mr Cummings have spoken of his desire to “napalm” his former boss in No 10 even to the extent of disclosing sensitive papers that he has retained since leaving his post.MPs are entitled to see information relevant to understanding how decisions were made when the scale of the virus became apparent. They are also justified in asking how pandemic planning had been updated and whether it was properly deployed. They might also usefully ask what analysis he and others inside Downing Street carried out of the likely consequences of locking down the country for months on end.In one of his numerous tweets Mr Cummings recently said that “many thousands will have serious health problems for years because of our failure to act fasterharder in FebMarch \u0026amp Sep.” Was any calculation made of the long-term health impacts of the lockdowns themselves with some 300,000 missed cancer diagnoses feared?If Mr Cummings’s contribution is designed to ensure that we are better prepared in future to deal with a pandemic then it is to be welcomed.

Rhodes has long been beyond the pale with calls for the removal of his statue from Oriel College, Oxford. The authorities now say that it would be too expensive to pull down, evoking fury from the Rhodes Must Fall Campaign, which describes the decision as “a slap in the face with the hand of white supremacy.” One might have thought the members of the campaign who think this all so important might have offered to raise the money themselves, but they keep their wallets firmly closed.What is more, they seem to have no compunction about taking advantage of the facilities endowed by Rhodes from his trading activities which they deplore. Rhodes has long been a target of the “Woke-Folk” but Professor Fuentes of Princeton University condemns Darwin of letting his scientific process becoming warped by his prejudices and accuses him of using his theories to condone colonialism, imperialism and genocide. As I read Darwin, he merely noted that different tribes of mankind in different parts of the world had reached different levels of scientific knowledge and economic progress. I am a bit more relaxed about much of this than Professor Fuentes.I notice the ascendancy of athletes of colour in many sports with complete equanimity, just as I do that in many others including my favourite sport of cricket. Men have an advantage over women from the greater size and weight. None of that lessens my enjoyment of watching women’s cricket. I also enjoy watching equestrian events and here the skills of men and women and the capacity of mares and stallions with a woman jockey riding a mare to win the recent Grand National.    I have long argued that whatever the merits or demerits of our primary and secondary education system we lack a technical education system to provide the skills needed in the employment market.Some years ago we had such a system, although nothing to match that in Germany, but counter-productive education reforms obliterated it in favour of third rate universities which beguiled school leavers into taking out loans to finance themselves to acquire commercially valueless degrees in subjects such as “media studies”. The commercially valuable skills and crafts such as data processing, high grade construction industry skills such as carpentry, joinery, brick-laying, scaffolding and the like were all regarded as below the threshold of the newly dignified tertiary education system. So I have high hopes of the Government’s Skills and Post-16 Education Bill which the Secretary of State sent into the House of Lords last week, expressing the Government’s wish “ to address the severe shortage of qualified people in key sectors such as engineering and health and social care.” And I particularly liked his commitment to “support the provision of high quality, higher level technical qualifications that can provide a valuable alternative to a university degree”.I am much less encouraged by an apparent failure of the Transport Department to understand the prime reason for the poor performance of the railway system. If only the Secretary of State and his advisers would look back to the years before the 1945 Labour Government took the railways into state ownership, he would see that each of the four great railway companies owned not only the rolling stock but the tracks, signalling systems and stations required to provide passenger and freight facilities. During the Second World War there was an understandable lack of investment in the railways and that was worsened after they were taken into state ownership. The Treasury was under great pressure to improve the National Health Service, pensions and the like and the needs of the railways were pushed aside in favour of investment in the more politically “sexy” areas.Now, whether the railway system remains in state ownership or is liberated into the private sector, in each of the isions, (the former great companies), Southern, London North Eastern, London Midland and Scottish, and The Great Western, the tracks, signalling systems, passenger facilities and rolling stock must be managed and owned as a single unit. If they are not, there would be unceasing conflict between the train operators wanting better signalling and passenger facilities and the companies owning those things wishing to minimize their capital investment and maximise their rental charges. One other of our great British institutions, the BBC, looks to be in some problems for having connived in the appalling conduct and deceits around the interview given by Princess Dianna to Martin Bashir. Although it was not related to political partisanship it can only add to disquiet about the management of the BBC which has too often taken sides in such controversies. Great institutions such as the BBC are all too likely to do more to serve themselves and their staff unless they enjoy a strong management with a company of openness. Change is overdue.Finally, as I look back at my praise of N.A.S.A. for the first landing of an explorer on Mars, it would be churlish not to mark the similar remarkable Chinese achievement which leaves us Europeans standing.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"snp may play cynical politics immigration enforcement plenty","story":"The home secretary couldn’t have got a better reaction even if she had been deliberately trolling her Scottish opponents.A fortnight ago an attempt by immigration authorities to remove two men who were living illegally in Glasgow was foiled after local residents blockaded the van carrying them. After an hours-long stand-off, the police advised that the two men should be released. This was welcomed by campaigners for open borders as a great triumph of people power and a rebuke to the rule of the UK government in Scotland.Following a speech on immigration today, Priti Patel insisted she would authorise such an operation again and that that is what the “British people voted for”.You could almost hear the indignant spluttering of keyboard warriors across the country as the home secretary was taken to task on her audacity. Perhaps the British people did indeed vote for such a heartless system, but the Scottish people (being genetically predisposed to fairness and niceness, of course) certainly did not, was the general tenor of the response.At the risk of ruining everyone’s day with inconvenient stuff like facts, allow me to make a few salient points that just about every politician in Scotland – including, to its shame, the Scottish Labour Party – have forgotten.First, it is entirely accurate to suggest that the people of Britain have indeed voted consistently for governments that have taken a robust approach to those who arrive here with a visa and then decide to remain here after it has expired. Such people did not arrive here seeking asylum, they are not refugees. They signed documents committing them to respecting the terms of their visas, they understood the consequences of disobeying the law. They accepted the terms. For those who deliberately and illegally overstay their welcome, uniformed men banging on their door at unexpected hours is not the first indication they have had that they may be flouting UK law. They are contacted on a number of occasions by immigration officials and it is explained to them, repeatedly, what the consequences will be if they ignore an instruction to leave of their own volition.If we have got to a stage when they have to be forcibly removed it is because they have deliberately ignored numerous polite requests that they comply with the arrangement they themselves voluntarily entered into before they got here.Secondly, voters across the UK – including many in Scotland – have consistently voted for governments, whether Labour or Conservative, who have been committed to the rule of law in immigration as in areas of more general criminality. Even those who now vote SNP are supporting a party that, in its 2013 white paper on independence, insisted that only those immigrants who fulfil certain criteria would be allowed to remain here.And here is a truth that is rarely uttered but needs to be acknowledged more frequently: by voting No to independence in 2014, the Scottish people acknowledged that they would be subject to the law, as legislated for at Westminster, on all matters reserved to the UK government. That included immigration, and everyone in Scotland, including all its political parties, understood that to be the case. A vote to remain in the UK was a vote for the devolution settlement, a settlement that ensured that immigration and a range of other vital issues would be the responsibility of the whole of the UK and not just Scotland.Opportunistic, populist political leaders who have signed a letter opposing immigration raids know this to be the case. The Scottish Labour ones in particular who added their signatures are playing a desperately dangerous game by supporting a nationalist agenda that seeks to depict Scotland as an unwilling, victimised part of the UK that didn’t really know what it was voting for when it rejected independence seven years ago.But we did know. Not only that but it is simply wishful thinking to state that “Scotland” is a single homogenous political entity and that it opposes immigration raids. There are plenty of people in Scotland who are realistic and grown up enough to recognise that if any country is to have an immigration policy (and all democratic countries do), then it should be enforced. The SNP can afford to grandstand cynically on this issue because they don’t have any powers over immigration (thanks to that vote by the Scottish people in 2014) and, in the event of independence, would have no compunction about sending in the immigration enforcers, since their only political ambition would by then have been achieved.Scottish Labour, similarly, has no prospect of holding immigration powers in Edinburgh, even if it ever wins power there. But by banging the nationalists’ drum on immigration, the party is undermining the devolution settlement when they should be supporting it. If its leader, Anas Sarwar, believes a Labour government at UK level will take a different approach, he should campaign for that. But claiming that immigration law and enforcement should not be happening in any part of the country where the UK government’s writ – as authorised by the Scottish people – runs, is doing the separatists’ job for them.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stonewall finally paying price turning back gay men lesbians","story":"This weekend, the reputation of LGBT charity Stonewall crashed as decisively as the British Eurovision entry. Not only did Matthew Parris, one of Stonewall’s founders, criticise their foray ‘into the trans rights war’ but they lost a key relationship with the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).This is not a minor blip in the culture wars it is the beginning of a reckoning against the woke authoritarianism that has gripped British institutions. For the past 20 years Stonewall has invited organisations to join its Diversity Champions scheme, whereby members pay a fee and allow the charity to vet their internal policies. The 850 signed-up include the Ministry of Justice and Cabinet Office.But this weekend it was revealed the EHRC will not be renewing their membership a blow for Stonewall which trades on its image as the equality expert. A letter from EHRC chairwoman Baroness Falkner stated membership of the scheme “had no influence on external work” and that the decision not to renew membership was purely financial. But the news follows increasing public disquiet about the role of Stonewall in shaping policies which critics argue undermine existing sex-based rights and penalise those who refuse to accept that ‘transwomen are women.’Last week saw the publication of the Reindorf Report, an independent investigation into the no-platforming of feminist academics by the University of Essex. Professors Phoenix and Freedman were disinvited from speaking due to preconceptions about their views on transgender people. Along with 120 other universities, University of Essex is a Stonewall Diversity Champion.The report was damning, noting the university had adopted policies which reflected “the law as Stonewall would prefer it to be, rather than the law as it is.” Significantly, it advised that should the university continue with its membership of the Stonewall scheme it “devise a strategy for countering the drawbacks and potential illegalities.” Stonewall’s problems can be traced to the appointment of Ruth Hunt in 2014.Having won the fight for same sex marriage, there was nowhere to progress for lesbian, gay and bisexual equality. Following a consultation with 700 trans people, in 2015 Stonewall accepted a donation to ‘integrate trans-specific work’ into its campaigns. In 2019 Hunt left Stonewall and accepted a peerage.There is no link between people who identify as trans and those who are same-sex attracted the addition of the ‘T’ to the ‘LGB’ was more about funding than facts. Today Stonewall promotes the notion that each of us has a ‘gender identity’ and that this might not align with our sexed bodies. By doing so Stonewall opened the ideological door to the concept of ‘lesbians with penises’ and ‘gay men with vulvas.’ Unsurprisingly, many lesbians and gay men have objected to this idea.Simon Fanshawe OBE was one of Stonewall’s founders he believes the charity has strayed from its core purpose and that it is now “entirely devoted to political conformity.” “Stonewall is no longer an advisor and campaigner on lesbian and gay equality. Instead, it has set itself up as the arbiter of who is the right kind of gay. It’s tells any gay man or lesbian who does not agree with its gender ideology that they have put themselves \u0027outside Stonewall\u0027.”Fanshawe is far from alone in his criticism of Stonewall. Allison Bailey is a lesbian barrister with concerns about the embedding of gender ideology in institutions. Bailey alleges that Stonewall colluded with her employer to remove her and is suing both.On Monday 24 May, in an attempt to deflect from negative coverage Stonewall launched a new strategy with the strapline ‘Free to be.’ But there is no freedom for gay men like Simon Fanshawe or lesbians like Allison Bailey to be critical of gender ideology. Having undermined its foundations by alienating same-sex attracted people, it seems Stonewall may finally be about to fall.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"submarine telegram 1851 thought worlds first goes hammer","story":"The message was transmitted across 25 nautical miles of copper wire carried across the English Channel from South Foreland, in Kent, to Calais.It reads: PRINTED-FROM-ENGLAND-TO-FRANCE-SEPT-28-1851-6-P-M. The piece of paper, complete with a scrapbook of information and cuttings about the breakthrough moment, is being sold by a private collector and is expected to fetch up to £5,000 on Tuesday. It is a tiny slip of paper, and the only way it survived is because the original recipient placed it into an album.This telegram sits right at the beginning of communication between nations and across the sea, signalling a really important moment.They founded the Submarine  Company with the goal of taking the technology international. Using their familial wealth, they mounted an experimental attempt to connect Calais and Dover on August 28, 1850, and it was a partial success.The flimsy cable laid across the seabed soon broke, but not before it had enabled a message to be sent from England to France.The messages were severely distorted and only a garbled, indecipherable jumble of characters was transmitted, but the proof of concept was enough to garner worldwide attention and allow the brothers to secure further funding.This allowed a more robust cable to be built which would not only survive for longer, but would maintain the integrity of the original message.The next expedition, on September 25, featured this iron-clad copper cable, which was able to protect against saltwater and rogue fishing ships, which had both scuppered previous attempts. However, the brothers had underestimated how much cable was needed to be able to cross the channel and their 25 nautical miles of insulated copper left them more than a mile adrift off the French coast. The cable was laid across the sea bed, which makes it not so strange that they ran out of cable as there are unknown metrics and undulations to contend with, Dr Heaton told The . The technology was so experimental that they went out to sea and realised they were a couple of miles short and ran out of cable. They had this fairly good quality cable within two miles of Calais and then they had to jerry rig the last stretch to the shore with a substandard substitute.The telegram up for auction was sent two days after the cable was completed along this spliced line, and before the final stretch was upgraded about a month later.An official opening of the international submarine telegram network was held on November 19, 1851, when the line was open for public use. The blueprint created by the Submarine  Company\u0027s submarine system was used to create the transatlantic version which sent its first messages in 1858.The item is being sold as part of a collection at Sotheby\u0027s auction house, starting on Tuesday at 2pm.Other lots available include a signed letter from Albert Einstein to his son, a signed letter from Charles Darwin to the prominent 19th century zoologist Enrico Giglioli and an autograph by the late Stephen Hawking, dated to 1979.The day of science-oriented items also includes work relating to Alexander von Humbolt, Johannes Kepler, Nicolaus Copernicus, Louis Pasteur and Mary Anning.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"australia trade deal proves boris","story":"NewsopinionAustralia trade deal proves Boris’ Johnsons Brexit boasts are a load of bullThe Prime Ministers poor post-Brexit trade deals show the desperation of a charlatan who sold the country a pup, writes Kevin MaguiremirrorShareCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  MAY NewsopinionThe fact remains the Brexit Britain painted by Boris Johnson never existed \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Either way, the government needs a period of reflection in a darkened room, and perhaps a prescription to help it handle reality.Let not the high likelihood of psychosis stay the hand of Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, though, who has called today for the BBC to project British values, as though having it in its actual frickinapos name was not enough.Dowden is a former PR man who has been compared by some absolute tool to the Tory version of Alistair Campbell, which would be accurate,the inspiration for The Thick Of It aposs Malcolm Tucker was a wet weekend with Walter the Softy.Following on from last weekaposs Panorama brou-ha-ha - which is about as accurate as Martin Bashiraposs bank statements - Dowden has written some words in The Times which scream hypocrisy in the same way as Priti Patel accusing someone of bullion. The BBC must act quickly to restore trust and reassure the country it will shine a light on any other areas falling short of the high standards we rightly expect from it, he wrote of an organisation which literally just screened a documentary to millions of people about how naughty it had been. He criticised the lack of oversight and challenge which may have had a few holes at New Broadcasting House, but which Dominic Cummings will surely inform us later this week is entirely non-existent behind the gates of Downing Street.And he threatened to rethink the licence fee unless the BBC made efforts to project British values... with renewed vigour and ambition. If only someone in government would suggest the same to the actual government. For example, that it could project some: . Good manners  Someone should tell Priti Patel that sheaposll be on the naughty step until she realises that apospolitical correctnessapos is the exact same thing as aposdo unto others as you want them to do to youapos, a quote double-sourced by both Luke and Matthew as being first uttered by Jesus, who also made a fuss about being aposwokeapos a few chapters later.Manners maketh the man, as a former Etonian headmaster once wrote, and they do the same for a government which can barely manage to be polite to the Queen and is simply obnoxious to everyone . Its voters and citizens are treated as mince-thick morons while those in control give a virus complete freedom of movement and lock everyone  out of the pub.There is not a single decision these people make which is not breathtakingly rude to someone, somewhere. And thataposs just not cricket, is it  . Democracy  The Mother of Parliaments, Magna Carta, the first constitutional monarchy in the modern world, and the home of Fleet Street which since  has spread its diaspora around the world to hold the powerful to account on behalf of humanity: Britain has a pretty good record on democracy.Illegally closing Parliament, flouting domestic and international law, lying to the Queen, and dragging the Street of Shame further into the foul lies he always got away with writing: Boris Johnson has a pretty poor record on the same. Throw in voter ID cards to tackle electoral fraud which does not exist at the known expense of disenfranchising millions whose only protection is the right to vote, and youaposve got a black hole into which British freedoms are being sucked. Itaposs an actual dementor of democracy. . Obey the rule of law The Supreme Court ruled two years ago that this government was pro-rogueish, and so it has continued to be. The latest wheeze is to restrict the power of courts to scrutinise government actions, which is being sold as the will of the people versus unelected judges, but is in fact government being free to break its own laws. In  the government lost % of judicial reviews, on grounds that can include the of abuse of power, irrationality, illegality, unfairness and breach of human rights. It is, quite literally, the only way to overturn a government action that breaks the rules. And of course,we did the same, weaposd be arrested. This government thinks it shouldnapost have to follow them. If it were a person, you wouldnapost even wish it a good morning.  The average Brit, when there is something they would like or need, will wait patiently in a queue. We do it for everything from a cappuccino to the newest iPhone to a car insurance quote, and we donapost even like those. A queue is the embodiment of calm, reason, and good manners. It is democracy and the rule of law, boiled down to waiting patiently for your turn.And the opposite of that is a aposVIP laneapos for mates of ministers with a sudden thirst for a multi-million pound government contract to deliver a shoddy version of something theyaposve never supplied before. It is undemocratic, almost certainly unlawful, and a frenzied dash for cash that, were it repeated down the benefits office, would draw the firmest of criticisms from those same politicians.The Prime Minister has never had to queue for anything in his le, and it shows. . A sense of irony  Dowden promised to look at standards and governance, consider performance issues and the effectiveness of watchdogs, saying that what was so shocking was that failures went right to the top of the institution and that it took so long to get to the truth. He even discussed that group psychology phenomenon of groupthink, when those who cut themselves off from others agree on all things, and see all evidence to the contrary as an attack, and leads to a lack of challenge and poor decision-making.And what a classic case of projection that is. Because while writing a fact-free press release to please his overlords, Dowden has accurately summed up the fundamental problem with the government heaposs a part of: a total lack of British values, and an overdose of flags. Dr Dowdenaposs diagnosis was a new emphasis on accuracy, impartiality, and ersity of opinion, and I think we can all agree that some truth, fairness, and total lack of Brexit ideology would be a welcome improvement in the goings-on of government.And as he suggested looking at the licence fee, perhaps we too should consider whether lining the pockets of your friends while in power, and your own after losing it, is really a sustainable funding model for the future.If they can fix that, perhaps there will be no need for Nicola Sturgeon to break up this great British institution into its component parts. Still,she did, I expect we could at least earn a bob or two in that brave new world with a Boris Johnson streaming service: we could call it Twatflix.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMartin BashirPriti PatelAlastair CampbellPrincess DianaBoris JohnsonTony BlairThe TimesConservative PartyBBCChannel Supreme CourtDocumentariesPanoramaShakespeareThe Thick of ItRoyal FamilyPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"marcus rashfords simple life message","story":"NewsMarcus Rashfords simple le message as MPs begin debating child food povertyAs MPs debated a petition signed by more than . million people, calling for an end to child food poverty, big-hearted Manchester United and England star Marcus Rashford said in le theres the right thing to do and the wrong thing to domirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsMarcus Rashford said todays debate was confusing as solutions had already been endorsed \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The charityaposs outlets gave away ,, emergency parcels – and with each package containing enough food for three meals a day for three days, it means the Trust provided ,, meals. Nearly a million parcels went to children, meaning ,, kidsapos meals were provided. Labour MPs blamed the Tories for fuelling child poverty. Shadow Minister Tulip Siddiq said: “More families than ever are having to rely on foodbanks to feed their children. “This food poverty is a result of poverty itself, which has been rising dramatically since . “Rising levels of child poverty are a direct result of policy choices over the last decade.”  Labouraposs Grahame Morris said: “This is the defining issue of our time. “Itaposs not some happenstance that so many children have been driven into poverty. “This is the result of Government policies.” But Conservative backbencher Jerome Mayhew blamed family breakdown and drug-taking for some households being mired in poverty – and urged parents to take responsibility for their kids.  “As a parent myself, one of the key le lessons I try to give my own children is that of personal responsibility,” he said. “Reasons for childhood hunger are complex and it will hamper our ability properly to address those causeswe choose for political or campaigning reasons to over-simply them. “They include unemployment, a sudden change of family income, chaotic finances, drug dependency, poor access to good quality food shops, poor food education, the breakdown of relationships and low pay in employment.” Education Minister Vicky Ford said the Government had increased Healthy Start vouchersapos value to £. a week and was providing holiday activities and free school meals out of term time this year. “This Government is dedicated to supporting those children and families, especially the most vulnerable and the Government is fully considering all the recommendations of the National Food Strategy,” she said. “We will respond more fully following the next and final report which is due in the summer.” MPs also called for a £-a-week rise in Universal Credit, which boosts six million familiesapos incomes by £,-a year, to be extended.

He added: Covid certication would ease the current pressure as indicated by the Events Research Programme,it included vaccination evidence - but nevertheless represents a burden and itaposs only worth itthe alternative is going back to social distancing. Meanwhile, a hospitality industry chief warned any delays to relaxing Covid restrictions could put hundreds of pubs in jeopardy. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub association said the introduction of vaccine passports or testing passports to access bars and restaurants would hit revenues in the sector by %, because it makes people less likely to make ‘spontaneous’ visits to venues.  And any delay to scrapping social distancing measures beyond  June would prevent the struggling hospitality industry from starting its recovery. To put it really simply our businesses will not start their journey to recovery until all the restrictions are removed, she said - adding that  million pints had been literally thrown down the drain during the previous lockdowns. So the  June has to be the date that all restrictions fall away. It limits our capacity and so any lingering restrictions really put at risk and in jeopardy the future of many pubs, but also our brewers. But the plea came as health experts warned indoor venues with poor ventilation, and where people spent long periods of time, increased the risk of spreading the disease. And a Government vaccine expert warned % of the UK would now have to have Covid- antibodies to achieve aposherd immunityapos after the arrival of iants from overseas. Professor Peter Openshaw of Imperial College London told MPs it had originally been thought the spread of the disease would slow down when around % of the population were either vaccinated or had antibodies from having previously had the virus.  But he said the introduction of new strains which are more transmissible, such as the India iant, meant more people would have to have immunity for it to slow the virus down. And Professor Judith Brewer, Director of Infection and Immunity at University College London, warned aposherd immunityapos would be near impossible while border rules still allowed new strains in to the country. Youaposre not ever going to reach herd immunity, unless you prevent iants coming in to the country, she told the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee .

Arco, which was founded in , employs , UK staff and has extensive experience supplying PPE, secured just £ million worth of contracts. Meanwhile smaller firms - many of which had no experience in the field - were handed hundreds of millions in deals via the VIP lane. Matt Hancockaposs Department of Health and Social Careis locked in a High Court battle over the so-called VIP lane - which allowed friends and contacts of ministers and officials to jump the queue for lucrative contracts at the peak of the pandemic. Arco chief Thomas Martin said certied stock was sitting in his firmaposs warehouse as he and his team struggled to get the attention of the Governmentaposs procurement team. Despite having stock available and a tried and tested supply chain, he said his team were unaware that a fast-lane existed for offers of support for the government. In the end we took matters into our own hands, and we worked around the system that you were trying to control, Mr Martin told the Commons Public Accounts Committee. We responded directly to a number of approaches from NHS Trusts ...we tried to access the portal, we were unaware of the fast track principles, we then escalated through a number of ministers, MPs and the cabinet office and were still unsuccessful. Mr Martin said he had written to Lord Deighton, an advisor to Matt Hancock, to alert him to the situation, but received no response. We really tried, he said.  Andyou read my letter to Lord Deighton youaposll see we were frustrated and fearful for the fact that we could not deploy our sales force, our warehousing resource, our quality assurance and our technical expertise theand breadth of the UK. He added: I believe [The Department of Health and Social Care] were dealing with an exponential rise in offers without any filtering in place to decide what was a bona fide offer and what was a speculative offer. Meanwhile, Sarah Stoute, CEO of major PPE supplier Full Support Healthcare , said she had warned the government they faced imminent supply issues as early as December . “We started to talk to them about stock issues in December ,” She said.  “All of the hubs in the country were emptying. There was no stock and hospitals had started to call, to say they were in a panic. It took all of December and January to beg [the Government] to release the Brexit stock as a matter of emergency, whilst we went to production full-scale in the background, and urged them to place orders on products that were running out.“There were three suppliers providing a particular product, all three based in Wuhan, and I made a call to say: ‘You’re going to have a major problem on this, because nothing is coming out of Wuhan. You need to ring the other two suppliers and buy everything you can get your hands on. You’re going to need a huge amount, it doesn’t matter where it comes from, just get the product’. The person I was speaking to in inventory tried to escalate that and was ignored – and was in a very stressed state about it.” Ms Stoute said her firm risked financial ruin by ramping up production massively while the Government were still trying to understand the scale of the crisis.  She added: We’d already gone to production for things we couldn’t afford to pay for, waiting for the Government to catch-up.” Ms Stoute said the Government gives her firm a forecast of what PPE they will need for the winter every year, which they ignore, because it’s always less than the year before - and roughly half what the NHS needs. She added: “Every single winter there is a shortage that is covered up by the fact that we over order.”FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSHospitalsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"boy 11 dialysis three years","story":"NewsBoy, , on dialysis for three years finally gets new kidney - from his teacherEXCLUSIVE: Gavin Sexton was just eight years old when he went into renal failure and needed a new kidney.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeRobyn Sexton sat at her computer with her husband Ward by her side. Then she typed out the email she hoped she’d never have to write. We need a kidney. More accurately, Gavin needs a kidney, and we hope this letter helps explain why we are asking so much of you. Gavin, Robyn and Ward’s eight-year-old son, had had a dficult start to le. After being diagnosed with stage  Wilm’s Tumour, a form of kidney cancer found in children, when he was just three, Gavin had spent much of his short le in treatment. “He had an operation to remove the tumour along with his left kidney. Then he had chemotherapy and radiotherapy,” Robyn told The Mirror. After a few cycles of treatment, scans revealed the cancer had spread to Gavin’s lungs - and that meant yet more treatment.  The Sextons breathed a sigh of relief when Gavin finished chemo and radiotherapy and was in remission. But their joy was short lived as the cancer ed a year later. “They discovered it near the kidney again. Doctors told us he’d need tough radiotherapy which would eventually destroy Gavin’s remaining kidney,” Robyn said. Another few months of gruelling treatment followed before Gavin was declared cancer-free again. Three months later, he went into renal failure when his kidney stopped working. “We knew it was coming but we had no idea it would be that quick,” Robyn added.  Now eight-and-a-half years old, Gavin was put on dialysis. He missed out on so much. He couldn’t play sports with his friends. We’d signed him up for swimming lessons, but you’re not allowed to swim on dialysis.” Robyn and Ward knew their youngest son’s lestyle couldn’t go on forever - he needed a transplant. But Gavin had to be two years cancer-free before he was eligible for a new kidney. For the next few years, the routine remained the same. Every night before he went to bed, little Gavin was hooked up to a dialysis machine that cleaned his blood for  hours. Finally, Gavin passed the milestone of two years without cancer and his parents put him straight on the deceased donor list.  “The problem is, sometimes the wait for a new organ can take years,” Robyn explained. Gavin had already been through so much.Both Robyn and Ward were tested to seethey could give Gavin one of their kidneys. Robyn wasn’t a match. Gavin was eligible, but he had high blood pressure so the procedure would be riskier.Now they took matters into their own hands. They typed out an email to their friends and family, hoping someone would be kind enough to get tested. After a few weeks, Robyn received a message from Ann Chiumino. She didn’t know the family, but she’d been forwarded the email. She also happened to be an administrator at Gavin’s school and she wanted to give him her kidney.  “I met up with Ann and she said she was touched by our story. She told me that donating her kidney to Gavin was something she felt she had to do. “I just thought, ‘wow, this is so kind that she wants to put herself in this process’,” Robyn said. Ann explained she had discussed her plans with her husband and two daughters, and they were happy for her to go ahead.Soon after Ann threw her hat in the ring, the coronavirus pandemic hit, putting Gavin’s operation on hold. But despite the long wait, Ann never wavered in her commitment to the family. When lockdown lted, she began having tests to confirm she was a match and healthy enough to donate her kidney. Finally, in February , the day of the operation came around. An anxious Robyn and Ward went into hospital with Gavin and had a nail-biting nine hour wait while he and Ann went under. “We were getting live updates like: ‘The kidney’s on ice’ - it was exciting but weird,” Robyn recalled. Thankfully the operation was a success and after three long years, Gavin, now , finally had a new kidney.  “There were still coronavirus restrictions in place but Ward and I were allowed to be with Gavin when he woke up. “Then the next day, I was lucky enough to be allowed to see Ann too.” As Robyn saw the woman who had saved her son’s le, she was almost lost for words. “All I could do was tell her she was an angel. I was awestruck by her selflessness,” she said. Ann was groggy and in a bit of pain, but she’d done amazingly well and was allowed home to recover the next day. After two and a half weeks in hospital while Ward and Robyn taking turns to stay the night, Gavin came home too.  “We invited Ann and her family over a few days later to see Gavin for a little meet-and-greet. It was lovely to see them together. “They’ve seen each other a few times since and they’re building a really sweet relationship. I know they’ll be lelong friends.” After a dficult few weeks of managing new medicine and pain, Gavin is getting better every day. His appetite, which had been suppressed by dialysis, is coming back and he’s enjoying his favourite treats of biscuits and chocolate milk. His older brothers, Ben, , and Ryan, , are relieved to have him home too. “They’re all incredibly close - they still fight though!” Robyn said. With a new kidney in tow, Gavin will soon be allowed to do so many of the things he missed out on - like school trips, non-contact sports and sleepovers with his friends. “He’s such a fun, energetic, sweet boy who loves his friends,” Robyn said. “And Ann is a member of our family now. I still can’t believe how selfless she is. If our story can inspire even one person to become an organ donor, then it’s worth telling.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnOrgan donation"},{"url":null,"title":"new mum 31 weak couldnt","story":"NewsNew mum, , so weak she couldnt hold baby after ear infection turned out to be brain tumourEXCLUSIVE: Hannah Grady was just  years old and pregnant with her fourth child when she started losing her balance.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeAs Hannah Grady looked at the two blue lines on her pregnancy test, she felt overwhelmed. Although she was happy to be carrying her fourth child, she’d recently suffered a miscarriage. “It was really scary. I was bleeding for the first  weeks of the pregnancy, which is the same thing that happened when I lost my previous pregnancy,” Hannah, now , told The Mirror. Luckily, scans revealed Hannah’s unborn child was doing well. Then, at  weeks pregnant, the mum-of-four went into preterm labour. She was admitted hospital and given injections to pause labour, which worked. That’s when things started to go downhill. “I started having dizziness, which doctors put down to anaemia. Then my balance became affected and I was told it was an ear infection,” Hannah recalled. Hannah accepted the diagnosis, but there was a niggling thought in her mind.  “When I was three years old I had a brain tumour. I can’t remember it but I know I had my third birthday in hospital. Once I’d finished treatment I grew up like a normal child. “The thought of having another brain tumour briefly crossed my mind but I knew they were rare so I thought it couldn’t be that,” she said.But as the weeks passed, Hannah’s symptoms got worse. Soon, she was suffering from searing headaches as well as balance issues.“By now I knew it was worse than an ear infection. The pressure in my head was unbearable,” she explained.  After being induced, Hannah battled through a gruelling labour with her partner Jordan by her side before giving birth to her daughter Pippa. “I felt so ill. As I was pushing Pippa out, the pressure in my head got worse. I don’t know how I did it because I was so weak,” she described. By now, Hannah felt so unwell she could barely hold her newborn daughter in her arms “That feeling was taken away from me,” she said. Despite her symptoms, Hannah was sent home with Pippa the next day and told things should ease up now she’d given birth. But two days later, Hannah’s midwe came to see her and was alarmed. The new mum was bedbound, in unbearable pain and weaker than ever. She told Hannah to go back to hospital for an assessment. “They said I had endometritis and sent me back home,” she said. Endometritis is an inflammation of the lining of the womb which can cause infections after childbirth. Hannah and Jordan were sceptical of the diagnosis but Hannah was too weak to argue. By now, she couldn’t even put Pippa’s dummy in, let alone care for her other kids, Esme, Rory and Phoebe. Days passed and Hannah’s excruciating headaches continued. She was in so much pain she couldn’t move and she was slurring her words.  “I couldn’t move my head because the pain was so bad. It felt like someone was shooting me in the head. Imagine the worst headache of your le,” Hannah described. “I felt like I was dying.” Hannah was unable to sleep and lost the feeling in her right hand. Then, when she began vomiting uncontrollably, an incredibly concerned Jordan took her back to hospital. “He had to carry me into the car because I couldn’t walk,” Hannah said. “Then he dropped me off at AE and took the kids to the supermarket while I waited to be seen.” Finally, Hannah was taken in for a scan. But the results were more chilling than she’d imagined. She recalled: “I sat in a little side room while the doctors sat down in front of me. They told me I had a large brain tumour, andI didn’t have surgery I would die. “I burst into tears and called Jordan immediately to tell him. He came straight to hospital and brought me some clothes because I was being kept in. “It was a strange feeling because I was scared, but also relieved I finally had a diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t an ear infection.”  Hannah was put on steroids to reduce the swelling on her brain. Six days later, she had a  hour operation to remove the tumour and a cyst that was attached to it. Thankfully, the operation was a success and Hannah was allowed to go home a week later. But she had a long road to recovery ahead. “Jordan worked at Jaguar Land Rover at the time and they let him take six months off to look after me. We needed it, because he had to do everything,” Hannah recalled.Their community in Coventry, where the family lived at the time, also rallied around and raised £ for the family through a Facebook group.Luckily, Hannah recovered well, but she had to have another operation a year later in  when she had a build up of fluid in her head, known as pseudomeningocele. The cranioplasty involved draining the fluid from her head and putting an articial bone into her skull to patch up the leak. “There’s a bit of build up of fluid again but I’m hoping I won’t need another operation,” Hannah said. Pippa is now two years old and doing well. Phoebe, five, Rory, seven and Esme, eight, are enjoying school, but Esme worries about her mum sometimes. “She was the oldest at the time so she was slightly more aware of what was happening,” Hannah explained. While Hannah has physically healed well, the mental scars of the trauma have stayed with her. “I suffer from PTSD after what happened. I’m constantly worried I’ll collapse or lose my balance when I go out on my own. “I’ve signed up for free counselling sessions with the Yorkshire Brain Tumour Trust,” she said. Looking back, Hannah said she wouldn’t be here todayshe hadn’t listened to her instincts when she was sick. “I was told I couldn’t possibly have a brain tumour because they’re so rare. But that’s exactly what it was,” she said. She encourages everyone to trust their gutthey think something isn’t right. “People get scared they’re troubling their doctors by making an appointment, butyou know something is wrong, you have to get it checked out.”Do you have a story to share  Email webfeatures@trinitymirror.

They say Meghan appears to have double-jointed fingers, meaning some of her joints are hypermobile – and itaposs believed this can have a bearing on pregnancy. Hypermobility is genetic, and allows people to move parts of their body – often including their fingers – beyond the normal range without pain.Meghan, , and Prince Harry, , announced they were expecting a second baby on Valentineaposs Day this year and the Duchess of Sussex is expected to welcome a baby girl this summer.Dr Adam Taylor, a specialist in anatomy at Lancaster Medical School, believes hypermobility could make it easier to give birth. He told The Sun : “The ligaments of the pelvis, which help hold the pelvis together, are believed to loosen over pregnancy. So any more mobility within these from having hypermobility may help make delivery easier too.”Birth coach Alexandra Kremer added hypermobility may also mean the muscles holding in the baby are more lax, so Meghan could have an earlier or quicker labour. She said: “Due to how fragile the connective tissue can be, hypermobility has shown that there can be a connection with early labour.  But she warned hypermobility means pregnancy can take more of a toll on you and your body and said Meghan may need extra joint support like a pelvic belt. The child will be a younger sibling for the coupleaposs son, Archie, born on May , . Despite what the experts say about hypermobility, Meghan was eight days overdue when she gave birth to son Archie, according to royal biography Finding Freedom. She gave birth at the private Portland Hospital in London, and Archie weighed lb oz.  Meghan is likely to have lots of help during her second pregnancy – in the US this time, after Harry and Meghanaposs dramatic split from the Royal Family.A friend has said she may choose a £,-per-night Calornian maternity suite previously used by Kim Kardashian, Beyonce and Victoria Beckham when she gives birth this summer.Close friend Omid Scobie believes the former actress may choose to give birth at Los Angelesapos Cedars Sinai Medical Centre. From welcome packs with nappies - and wine - to gourmet dining and apossecret tunnelsapos, the swanky -acre complex is certainly fit for royalty.

They hit the jackpot after their postcode,NP LG, in the Welsh town of New Tredegar, was drawn as a big winner.And theyaposre already planning a bumper street party to celebrate the le-changing news. Among the winners are an NHS nurse, a set of relations and a winner who recently suffered heartbreak at the hands of covid. Support worker Gareth Walbeoff, , lost his father to the pandemic in January. He said: My poor mum was having to isolate for  days, so only I could go to console her, none of the other family could go. “Then she unfortunately fell and broke her back, she’s up and about now and my niece is taking her to a hospital appointment today. My niece is really good to mum, I couldn’t manage without her. She’s got three children and my nephew has a little girl as well. What I’m going to do is pay for all these kids to have a good holiday in a big -star, luxury caravan in Tenby for two weeks!  He also congratulated his neighbours and added: “In this street we all are like one big family. When it’s safe to do so we’re going to have one hell of a street party!”Gareth wasn’t the only member of his family to get a call from lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson . One of the other winners was -year-old Alan Vaughan whose partner, Nicola, is Gareth’s cousin.Another winner from the street was NHS nurse Tina Watkinswho learned of her windfall while on a break at work. As the cheque was revealed, the -year-old clapped with joy and said: “Woo!  grand! Oh that’s fantastic, thank you very much!” Her co-workers cheered on hearing the total and Tina said she would buy her manager, who was holding Tina’s camera phone over the call, ‘a nice big cake.’ Tina already had plans for some of her winnings: She added: “I’ve got a house renovation going on, so I can plough it into that and buy my son a car. What a lovely surprise, I can finish off what I want to do with the house without having to save. “Maybe a holiday next year. Our holiday to Fuerteventura was cancelled this year, but we might go further afield now.” People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson sent his congratulations to all the winners. He said: “What a fantastic surprise for our winners in New Tredegar! I can tell it is a really close community, so I was thrilled to bring this great news. “Congratulations to them and all our other winners today, I’m sure they’ll enjoy their winnings.” Everyday throughout the April draws one postcode was announced as a £, prize winner. All the players in the postcode won £, for every ticket they hold. People’s Postcode Lottery costs £ a month to play and there are guaranteed winners every day. People play with their chosen postcode and are automatically entered into all draws.A minimum of % of ticket sales goes directly to charities and players of People’s Postcode Lottery have helped raise over £ million to date for thousands of good causes across Britain and internationally. This draw was promoted on behalf of Postcode Education Trust. The Trust supports charities and good causes which provide education, particularly in emergency situations, through regular grant funding.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnNHSDaryl JohnsonBettingHospitalsLottery"},{"url":null,"title":"i wish boyfriend wilder bedroom","story":"NewsopinionI wish my boyfriend was wilder in bedroom but I think my sex toys will scare him offA bored reader asks Daily Mirror agony aunt Coleen Nolan for advice on how to spice things up with an inexperienced lovermirrorShareCommentsByColeen Nolan:,  MAY NewsopinionThis girlfriend fears her love will take sex chat as an insult\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Meghan and Harry, who are already proud parents to Archie, announced on Valentineaposs Day that they are expecting their second child after the Duchess suffered a miscarriage last year.During her interview with Oprah Winfrey alongside husband Prince Harry, Meghan would only say their baby daughter would be arriving this summer.But their baby girl may be here by the end of the month, it has been claimed.  Daily Beastaposs respected Royalist newsletter says Meghanaposs due date could actually be in May. The Royalist was always taught summer started in June, but there have also been rumours the baby was due sooner than that, so we think the answer is aposany day nowapos, the newsletter read. She may choose to give birth at Los Angelesapos Cedars Sinai Medical Centre, close friend Omid Scobie has hinted. The £,-per-night Calornian maternity suite previously used by Kim Kardashian, Beyonce and Victoria Beckham may be used to welcome the new arrival. Omid, author of bombshell biography Finding Freedom, suggested Meghan may opt for Cedars Sinai during Channel  documentary A Very Royal Baby : From Cradle to Crown.“There is a lot of speculation about where Harry and Meghan’s daughter might be born, he said. “Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles has some of the finest maternity suites in the country.” Suites at the Beverly Bouled site, right next to the affluent Beverly Hills neighbourhood of Los Angeles, come with three-bedrooms and two luxury bathrooms.  A night in the deluxe maternity suites, which it is said could easily be mistaken for a five-star hotel room, costs nearly £,. Meghan would have   access to a personal doula, who can offer “physical, emotional and educational support”. Royal biographer Angela Levin has meanwhile explained why the pair probably wonapost pick a traditional royal name for their baby girl. But she says the Duchess would be proud to call their second child Diana. Diana, Elizabeth, Alexandra and Grace are among the bookiesapos favourite names. Royal expert Ms Levin, author of Harry: Conversations with the Prince, told the Mirror: Iaposm sure they will call her Diana.  I think Harry would love that, and Meghan would be very proud because she would bring Diana close to him. What would be extraordinary isthe baby was born within a few days of the unveiling of Diana’s statue in the summer. She added: I don’t think they will use a royal name that has been part of the name of a previous royal who is no longer with us. They could try to find something maybe in Greek that will let them have another foundation.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrince HarryRoyal FamilyMeghan Markle"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The snap is the third to be released in as many days after concerns have been raised about the -year-old who had not been seen in public since . In February the Emirati princess, who is the daughter of Dubaiaposs ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, shot a video where she claimed she was being held against her will by her dad. In  the princess tried to flee the UAE and it has been claimed she has been locked up since. The princess had been captured as she tried to flee across the Arabian Sea and was brought back to her dad in Dubai.  The Sheikh denies Lataaposs claims and insists she is safe and well. The footage sparked international concerns for her welfare and prompted the UN Human Rights Office to request evidence that she This latest snap was posted by Fiona Day who posts regularly online about animals and veganism - which are both passions shared with the Princess. Fiona describes herself as an intuitive consultant and a psychic medium.  The new image which shows Latfia with a subdued smile has not been independently veried. The second image shows the princess sitting shoulder to shoulder with a apospalapos in Dubai Italian restaurant Bice Mare and is understood to be legitimate, according to Sky News.

Both images were posted on Instagram by a user named Sioned aposShinnyapos Bryn, a public account which had  followers on Monday after it attracted more than  over the weekend.  Radha Stirling is the founder of Detained in Dubai who the princess sought help from during her failed escape.Ms Stirling, who bought the claims of her kidnap to the media, told Sun Online : There is no doubt that the photos have been staged in response to growing concern over Lata’s welfare but the government opted to respond to concerns via Instagram, rather than submitting to United Nations calls.That doesnapost mean that Lata is not cooperating and benefiting from the progression. Body language expert Judi James told Sun Online Lata’s body language in these posts fail to show her emotional state but she appears to be acting dferently to the others.  She added: There is no doubt that the photos have been staged in response to growing concern over Lata’s welfare. The ones looking the most relaxed and the ones really prompting and creating the smiling poses are the other women here.

I can seat him on the back and heaposs got his arms out and heaposs like aposwhoah.apos But archive pictures have surfaced clearly showing a young Harry on the back of a bike being ridden by his father, and another where heaposs being towed in a cart by his dad. One picture, from , shows him sitting behind his dad while they ride alongside Prince William, who is on his own bike. Another shot showed young brothers Harry and William looking cheerful while riding their own bikes with their parents Charles and Diana. The prince has been called out for the apparent discrepancy on social media. Journalist Martin Jay tweeted: Is ANYTHING in Meghan and Harry on Oprah interview true  !!! Another tweeter questioned Harryaposs comments before they referenced Buckingham Palaceaposs response to the Oprah interview saying: One of the many reasons why Queen Elizabeth II said “recollections may y”.Another user weighed into the conversation as they commented: Hope Oprah sees it. Harry seems to have amnesia yet there were many bike rides as a family. In the tell-all interview broadcast on CBS and then ITV, Harry and Meghan, who quit their lives as senior royals last year to move to the US, made sensational claims of racism against The Firm.They claimed concerns had been raised about how dark their son Archieaposs skin tone would be, although Oprah then spoke out to say it was neither the Queen or Prince Philip who made the remarks.Meghan also claimed she was failed the mental health support needed while feeling suicidal when pregnant with her son Archie. Buckingham Palace said in a statement a few days after the bombshell interview: The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan.The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. Whilst some recollections may y, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrince HarryOprah WinfreyRoyal FamilyMental health"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry wants forget like","story":"NewsPrince Harry trying to lose similarities to Philip and make new persona, expert saysThomas Mace-Archer Mills, founder of the British Monarchists Society, said Prince Harry used to be much like how he described his late grandad Prince Philip but now seems to have lost his humourmirrorShareCommentsByRyan MerrieldReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPrince Harry has lost his sense of humour, a royal expert has claimed \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

And Harry was also known for his sense of humour in the Firm, as well as occasionally completely missing the mark - including dressing up as a Nazi at a aposcolonials and nativesapos party in .Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here The Duke of Sussex has chosen to ignore and forget his less than favourable gaffes by burying them under several layers of political correctness and woke cushioning, in hope that his newly created persona will distance him from any wrongdoing or offence he caused when his gaffes were knowingly made, Mr Mace-Archer Mills said. Harry used to be like his grandfather, he had charisma, and charm - he was able to also use humour as a tool, but this is where the similarities end. Mr Mace-Archer Mills said there is nothing funny about the Duke any more and he no longer appears capable of using humour in his favour as Philip did. Not only have times changed, so has Prince Harry, he said.The expert described Harry as previously a ladaposs lad and a happy go lucky chap, but in recent months that appears to have been suppressed. During his heartfelt tribute to Philip following his death, the Duke called his grandad master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right apostil the end. Mr Mace-Archer Mills said: If there were any aspirations on the part of Harry to be the heir to Philipaposs aposlegend of banterapos, then those very aspirations are sadly misconstrued, misunderstood, and misguided - a failure. With the passing of Prince Philip, so went the last of the Windsoraposs great gaffes.  But while Harryaposs public appearances have been more sombre in recent weeks, including his recent appearance in Apple+ series The Me You Canapost See, his lighter side has also been evident.In February, prior to he and Meghanaposs bombshell Oprah Winfrey interview, the Duke playfully joked with James Corden in LA for a segment on the Late Late Show.At the time, royal staff were reportedly left feeling emotional after seeing the clips of him taking part in an obstacle course, calling at the Fresh Prince of Bel Air house and FaceTiming his we.  And former employees were said to have been thrilled with the interview, with sources claiming that they caught a glimpse of the old H during his appearance. Last week, however, he sparked outrage in his new homeland after describing the First Amendment - one of the countryaposs most cherished founding principles - as bonkers during a podcast interview. Mr Mace-Archer-Mills said it was an example of how previously Harry, who could appeal to anyone is now a partisan, isive, talking head that chastises and lectures his home nation and belittles his family.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnSpotyAppleMeghan MarkleDax ShepardPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince HarryPrincess DianaPrince WilliamPrince Charles, Prince of WalesApple TVPanoramaHospitalsPregnancyRoyal FamilyAdoptionBullying"},{"url":null,"title":"set life results live winning","story":"NewsSet For Le results LIVE: Winning lotto numbers on Monday, May The windfall of a letime is up for grabs tonight, with £, a month for the next  years the top prize in tonights lottery drawmirrorShareByMatthew DreschUpdated:,  MAY NewsA Set for Le prize of £, a month for a year is among other unclaimed winnings\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-cdn-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news set-le-results-live-winning- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-cdn-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"Someone could be about to land the windfall of a letime tonight when the Set For Le numbers are drawn.

Kieran Sidhu, , was targeted daily by workmates while working for tech firm Exertis in Basingstoke, Hampshire. Mr Sidhu, a Sikh Scotsman of Indian descent, was branded the only ethnic on the team and a temperamental Syrian immigrant who was f***ing for ISIS, a tribunal in Southampton heard. He has already won claims of race discrimination, racial harassment and constructive dismissal. He is seeking £.m in damages after experts said he had suffered such lasting psychological harm from the bullying he may never work again. A tribunal heard Mr Sihdu was subjected to abuse including his sales team ly accusing him of being gay, simulating sex acts with bananas, making lewd remarks about sausages, and trying to make him put on womenaposs lingerie in the office.  His workmates once encouraged him to go out and buy a £ tuxedo for a last-minute aposblack tieapos work event that they knew was, in fact, apossmart casualapos. It is claimed they would routinely sing, to the tune of aposQue Sera Seraapos: aposSidhu, Sidhu, he has a bomb in his shoe, he works at O, he is a f***ing dirty Arabapos. Mr Sidhu quit his job in the firmaposs Basingstoke office in May , suffering from extreme depression and anxiety. The tribunal heard how the harassment escalated from January  after he became an account manager.  The  at Southampton employment tribunal found that three of Mr Sidhuaposs former colleagues - Glynn Smith, Stuart Smith and John Cleary - racially harassed him. Mr Sidhu, who earned £, a year, will seek £,, million for lost earnings, injury to feelings and aggravated damages at a remedy hearing, due to take place in September. The earlier tribunal found that crude sexual innuendo and express sexual reference were considered entertaining banter at the male-orientated workplace. Mr Sidhu told how his team repeatedly taped McDonaldaposs adverts and a spoof male escort business card to his monitor, saying it was what he would be doing once he was sacked.  Glynn Smith referred to Mr Sidhu as f***ing for ISIS and circulated a photo of a bikini-clad woman, said to be aposKieranaposs replacementapos. His team would put Mr Sidhuaposs laptop in the bin, hide his mouse and chair in dferent locations around the office, and stand to applaud whenever he arrived at work late.He said: They thought this was funny but it was embarrassing and disruptive for me. Mr Cleary would deep-throat bananas, saying: aposKieran, you know what time it is. You know you want some, talk dirty to me bitchapos and aposYou must be so hard right now. Thataposs why you wonapost stand up.  Glynn Smith looked up Mr Sidhuaposs house on Google Maps and declared he lived in a s**t area that looks like a terrorist war zone, adding: Whataposs that place called, Aleppo  He also branded Mr Sidhuaposs car the s***est on the team, typed its registration into a used car website and told him they were only offering £. Mr Cleary would accuse Mr Sidhu of using gay dating app Grindr and tried to force him to wear lingerie on the sales floor. Stuart Smith would ask Mr Sidhu: Did you get much sausage last night , how big is your sausage  and do you have sausages in Syria  Colleagues taped pictures of sausages to Mr Sidhuaposs monitor and left post-it notes reading gay boy and a straw hat on his desk saying I love d***. One asked Mr Sidhu how it felt to be the only ethnic on the team and Glynn Smith said: You will be the last ethnicyou are anything to go by. Mr Cleary also sent a team email, suggesting that Mr Sidhu have sex with him in a car park after their work Christmas dinner. Mr Sidhu told his manager his colleaguesapos behaviour was draining and said it could not be dismissed as joking when it was happening daily. He reported a colleague for accepting entertainment in the form of weekend strip club visits, and for routinely showing Mr Sidhu the middle finger and telling him f*** your mum.  The tribunal found manager Matthew Rumsey showed little interest in Mr Sidhuaposs complaints of bullying, caring far more about the teamaposs sales targets. Instead, Mr Rumsey, who was even copied in by colleagues on several of the emails humiliating Mr Sidhu, took client accounts off him and tried to force him out of the firm because he did not fit with the team, the tribunal ruled. After assessing Mr Sidhu, psychiatrist Dr Jonathan Ornstein concluded he has a very low chance of recovery and is unlikely to be able to work again. Mr Sidhuaposs solicitor Lawrence Davies said the size of the claim reflected not only the gravity of the ordeal he suffered but the psychiatric assessment that, in all probability, his career is over. In a statement, Exertis said Mr Sidhuaposs experience was a unique case across a business of more than , employees. It said it had taken appropriate disciplinary action, adding: On this occasion it was clear that certain behaviours within a part of our business fell short of the standards we expect. If he wins, Mr Sidhuaposs award would exceed the record £.m tribunal payout made by the Royal Bank of Scotland last year in a disability discrimination case.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBullyingTribunalsRacism"},{"url":null,"title":"spanish holidays ruined dozens brits","story":"NewsPassengers sob after being turned away from plane to Spain over Covid documentsMore that  angry passengers were turned away from their Ryanair flight to Malaga, Spain, at East Midlands Airport for not carrying the correct Covid- documentsmirrorShareCommentsBySam Elliott-GibbsNigel Slater:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video spain-allow-uk-tourists-enter-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:mfXqD,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Many were told they could not go on their pre-booked Ryanair flight to Malaga as they had no proof of Spanish residency. The paperwork, at the time, was required by the Spanish government for people to travel to the country.There were tears of frustration when they were told they could not board the plane, DerbyshireLive reports.The incident happened on Friday but from today, the requirement is no longer in place.  Spain has opened its borders to visitors from countries that have low infection rates, including Britain. A passenger from Derby, who did not wish to be named, told the website things quickly turned toxic. He said: When I arrived at the airport I was asked to go to the Ryanair gate to have my documents checked. I did not expect any issue as I had been very thorough in obtaining all the documents they required.  I was met by a woman who informed people they would not be travelling unless they had a Spanish passport, proof of an application for residency or a letter from the UK Government saying the trip was essential. This led to anger, aggression and tears and three police officers had to oversee discussions. It was a truly shameful situation that caused great distress and large financial losses to some people. How we can have a validated form from the Spanish Travel Health government site allowing our entry and then be told this isnapost sufficient  This was distressing for many people.  Ryanair has all customersapos email addresses and telephone numbers so they could have contacted all passengers  hours prior to travelling, so this really is shameful and I hope it doesnapost happen to other UK travellers in the future. A spokesman for East Midlands Airport said: On Friday, May ,  passengers were refused boarding onto a flight to Malaga for not having a Spanish residency permit. The decision, taken by the airline’s handling agent, was in line with the requirements of the Spanish authorities at the time.  “We encourage anyone planning to travel overseas to familiarise themselves with what is required of both the destination country and the UK’s regulations prior to booking flights. Thousands of Brits were expected to jet to Spain today, defying Government warnings not to travel. The country remains on the “amber” list under the Department for Transport’s traffic light system, and ministers have pleaded with passengers not to fly without a valid reason.  Arrivals to the UK from amber list countries must self-isolate at home for  days and take two coronavirus tests.But after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez throws open the doors on Monday, many lockdown-weary Brits are expected to head for the Costas anyway. Flights from the UK to Spain are set to double to around  a day this week, carrying an estimated , passengers. It means more than , tourists could be jetting to Spain over the next few days.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnRyanair"},{"url":null,"title":"top 50 things really make","story":"NewsTop  things that really make people happy include old photographs and doing cleaningA survey of , adults by cleaning brand Marigold found the Top  things that really make Brits happy - and the Top  cleaning tasks that cheers us up, toomirrorShareCommentsByRob Knight:,  MAY NewsDogs can make Brits happy\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Other joyful things include waking up and realising itaposs the weekend, a hefty tax rebate, freshly washed sheets at the end of a long day and receiving a compliment.

Given the dficult year people have endured, weaposve enjoyed proving that happiness can be injected into your day-to-day le through tiny little actions, and these can be very rewarding.

Having a big clear out is the chore most likely to leave people feeling happy, with cleaning the kitchen, dusting, and cleaning the windows all featuring in the top . Clare Bolland, for Marigold, added: Happiness means something dferent to many people. For some, it stems from a bright sunny day, others enjoy making the people around them smile, whereas others enjoy the good karma of finding money in their back pocket. At Marigold, itaposs cleaning that makes us happy, and itaposs fantastic to see that this is the same for almost  per cent of Brits. Thereaposs nothing better than sitting back and surveying the squeaky-clean surfaces of a freshly groomed house - eventhis cleaning high might only last two-and-half hours before it gets messy again - and Marigold is the perfect accomplice. As we come out of an incredibly dficult time across the nation, this attitude of caring for others, and going out of our way to make others happy is something we should be really proud of, and weaposre thrilled to see cleaning plays a role in this. TV psychologist, Emma Kenny, said of the research: It exemplies the warm and giving nature of human beings who often find themselves increasing their happiness index because of the good deeds they do for others.

Michelle Prestwich, , was knocked to the floor and beaten by Alvin Williams when he stopped her in the street and demanded she pay him for the six month period she stayed at his flat. During the assault, Williams, , searched Mrs Prestwichaposs pockets before repeatedly punching her to the side of the face. He fled when staff at a nearby shop were alerted and told him to stop. The victim, who also suffered a suspected fractured eye socket in the attack on November  last year, was later rehoused outside the area. In a statement Mrs Prestwich told police: I was scared to death and terried when I was attacked. He is a big bloke, and I thought he would kill me. Still to this day I am having nightmares about this.  I was a victim of domestic violence in the past, and what he has done has brought back so much fear into my le. I have been placed in an area where I do not know anybody and I feel like I have got to start all over again. He has taken away all my independence, she added. At Manchester Crown Court, Williams, from Northenden near Wythenshawe, admitted causing grievous bodily harm and was jailed for  months. He was also banned from contacting Mrs Prestwich for two years under the terms of a restraining order. The court heard Mrs Prestwich had known Williams through her ex-husband and moved in with him when her marriage broke down. Prosecutor Daniel Lister said Mrs Prestwich had become homeless and began staying at friendsapos homes.  She then stayed at Williamsapos flat for six months, paying him £ per fortnight, he said. But not long before the offence happened, Mrs Prestwich moved out and began living with another friend in the same block of flats, the court heard. However, Williams claimed Mrs Prestwich owed him more money for the time she lived with him, Mr Lister said. She was walking with her friend when the defendant appeared on a bicycle, he continued. He screeched to a halt and threw the bike to one side then punched her to the side of her face. She fell back to the floor and he punched her twice more.  The complainantaposs friend went to a local shop to get help. Someone from the shop shouted at him to leave the complainant alone, which he did. The prosecutor said Williams went inside the shop and his victim ed to her friendaposs home and an ambulance was called before she was taken to hospital. Despite her injuries Mrs Prestwich did notto the hospital for follow up appointments so the extent of the suspected facial fractures could not be properly documented. Williams had  previous offences on his record including violence and battery. His lawyer Rachel Cooper said he had since found his Christian faith and wanted a clean slate. She added: The problem with Mrs Prestwich was her associations. It was not that she was causing problems for him, but because of the people she knew, problems were happening at the address. He was worried that it would threaten his tenancy and brought the bad blood between them. Ms Cooper went to say her client is fully remorseful of his actions and he genuinely wants to move on. Judge Mr Recorder Michael Maher said the offence was a nasty act in what appears to have been a chance encounter amid the ongoing dispute. She previously has been the victim of domestic violence, and you knew that because you provided her accommodation to escape that, he continued. You said you have turned your back on her and re-engaged with your faith. I do hope that is right, Mr Williams, the judge added.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnHospitalsCourt caseCrown courtDomestic violence"},{"url":null,"title":"woman who married herself five","story":"NewsWoman who married herself in five-star hotel has no regrets  years laterKaren Reed, , looks back on her  marriage ceremony where she committed herself to the person I love the most  years onmirrorShareCommentsByKatie PearsonAdam Barnett:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsKaren was walked down the aisle by dad Brian \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Jeremy Sturant was just  when he struck a deal that could have made him a multi-millionaire today. Instead, unaware of how big Bitcoin would become, he used up the crypto cash to cover expenses on a business trip – and the day has gone down in crypto currency history. Bitcoin Pizza Day, as it has come to be known, was celebrated this Saturday on the th anniversary of the fateful transaction. On  May , in the first documented purchase of physical goods with Bitcoin, Sturant answered a message on the Bitcointalk chat forum in  from hungry Bitcoin pioneer Laszlo Hanyecz.  It read: Iaposll pay , Bitcoins for a couple of pizzas... like maybe  large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. “You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what Iaposm aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I donapost have to order or prepare it myself. The message continues: I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that.  Hanyecz said: If youaposre interested please let me know and we can work out a deal. Sturant, from Calornia, US, stepped up to the plate, ordering two large supreme pizzas infor , Bitcoin.That sum was worth only about £ at the time, as The Sun reports. Today those coins would be worth around £,,.The cryptocash disappeared when Sturant used it to cover expenses while travelling the US with his girlfriend. He has said he “certainly” regrets it today – but argues he was simply “facilitating a purchase” at the time. Sturant said in : “At the time of the famous pizza I would never have thought that the same number of bitcoin would have a purchasing power on the order of real estate, or that major companies would accept bitcoin automatically for day-to-day transactions.  He said: That matters to me more than being worth a particular number of GBP, EUR, or USD.” For his part, Hanyecz said he felt like he was winning the internet that day. He has said: I donapost regret it. I think that itaposs great that I got to be part of the early history of Bitcoin in that way.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPizzaBitcoin"},{"url":null,"title":"mystery speeding objects detected underwater","story":"NewsMystery speeding objects detected underwater by US submarines ahead of Pentagon UFO reportIt is reported that government officials have secret evidence showing UFOs doing things that have defied explanation and even former President Barack Obama admits \"footage and records” existmirrorShareCommentsBySam Elliott-Gibbs:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video navy-detected-speeding-submerged-objects-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ITPIQo,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The Navy has located sonar data, which Washington Examineraposs Tom Rogan say proves the bizarre and unexplained encounters. It comes after a video emerged last week showing a dark object move across the sky near a naval stealth ship.Even former US President Barack Obama admits that footage and records” of unidentied objects exist, saying: Itaposs true - we don’t know exactly what they are, we can’t explain how they moved, their trajectory.The Pentagon, whose UFO report is due next month, later confirmed that the video – believed to be from  – was taken by Navy personnel.  Photos were said to have been leaked from an official investigation into unidentied flying objects which was readying evidence for Congress due in June. Mr Rogan told Fox News: Relevant to this video, an area we will learn more about is the interaction between US Navy submarines, nuclear ballistic submarines and attack submarines, picking up sonar contact of things moving at hundreds of knots under the water. There is an undersea dimension to this, on top of what the pilots are seeing above water. Anchor Tucker Carlson responded: Hundreds of knots under water  I donapost think people can even digest that. Mr Rogan told him: That is what I have heard from very good sources and that the US Navy has the data. Whether this being is worldly or otherworldly, we donapost know. Itaposs just part of a much larger series of events we are going to be learning about.  Last month The Drive reported that US Navy warships had been swarmed by six aircraft described as aposperforming brazen manoeuvresapos over the warships near a sensitive military training range. Recently it was reported that government officials have secret evidence showing UFOs doing things that have defied explanation. These include breaking the sound barrier without creating a sonic boom, and carrying out manoeuvres which are impossible with human technology.  John Ratclfe, who served as Director of National Intelligence under Donald Trump, made the claim ahead of the release of an aposX Filesapos report into aposunidentied aerial phenomenaapos.He claimed there were numerous sightings all over the world that military chiefs had been unable to explain.

Rakesh and Dakshina, from Madurai, India were desperate to tie the knot but with lockdown restrictions and social distancing measures in place, so came up with an alternative plan for their big day. The pair had their ceremony onboard a flight from Madurai to Bangalore on Sunday. The flight took off from Madurai International Airport at am, despite the guest list far exceeding the state governmentaposs stipulated  people for such gatherings. Video footage shows the flight absolutely packed to the brim with guests as the couple stand at the front of the aisle and exchange their vows.  The groom can be seen placing a traditional ornament around the brideaposs neck while attendees cheer and shower them both with flower petals. Rakesh and Dakshina tied the knot just as the aircraft hovered over the Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple. Following their onboard wedding, the couple headed to a hotel in Bangalore for a small reception. All of the guests had allegedly taken and passed a PRC test before boarding the flight. Do you think they did the right thing  Join the debate below  However, many guests opted not to wear masks or maintain social distancing for the special occasion.

building has welcomed back the smiling faces of pupils and staff after a major refurbishment.Aberfoyle primary school was remodelled and renovated to provide additional and modern learning spaces, which include four classrooms located in the main school building.Head teacher Maxine Barwick said: “It has been amazing to have all the children back in school, working away and learning together.“The building is bright and modern, but still feels like the primary school we all know and love so I’m delighted to get the first week under our belts and see all the children happy to be back home.”The structure, which dates back to , was restored and refurbished by Stirling Council who worked closely with a conservation architect and the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Planning Authority.The renovation came after the primary school was identied in September  as one of the five major investment education infrastructure priorities approved based on building condition

“The reopening of Aberfoyle Primary is fantastic news for the pupils and staff at the school.“We know it’s been a disruptive period for families and staff as the works were carried out, and I’d like to thank them for their patience and understanding.”Vice Convener, Councillor Christine Simpson said: “The completion of this ambitious project will give a new lease of le to this building which was starting to show its age, ensuring it is fit for st-century learning and teaching.“The major investment also underlines Stirling Council’s ongoing commitment to invest in its school estate to improve

and more ups and downs than a soap opera, Dundee are just one match away from the Premiership.Though manager James McPake insists Kilmarnock are still favourites to win the play-off final, the Dark Blues head to Rugby Park with a - lead.The weather was wet and windy but there were no dampened spirits after a focused and formidable Dundee performance that saw them dominate their top-flight opposition.Energised by a noisy  fans in the stands, the only disappointment for the Dens men is they aren’t heading into the second leg with a bigger advantage.But for some good saves from Killie keeper Colin Doyle, they may well have been out of sight.However, the tie is still finely poised heading into the second leg.So what did we learn from the first  minutes that might tell us what to expect in the second meeting  | SPFL\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed pgSI-zOzg featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreenThere’s absolutely no doubt theof supporters and the atmosphere they generated brought extra verve to the Dundee performance.And the players lapped up every ounce of the support from the stands, making a point after their warm-up to wander through the Killie players’ preparations to the other side of the ground.It was a gesture of thanks from the players to supporters after a long, hard year but the roar it generated from the Bobby Cox Stand spurred their favourites on.There was a crunching tackle from Shaun Byrne on Greg Kiltie inside  seconds that sparked the atmosphere.And within seven minutes the home crowd were cheering their first goal seen live since Kane Hemmings’ winner against Ayr on March , .Every tackle, run forward, defensive block and even throw-in won was greeted by cheers of encouragement.The manager and players said they felt there were more like , there than  and the supporters most certainly played their part in victory for the Dark Blues.The question now is whether Kilmarnock’s home support can have the same effect at Rugby Park on Monday night.Having Liam Fontaine back in central defence was a huge plus for James McPake and his side.That saw Jordan McGhee pushed back into the midfield role he’s been so good in this season and that paid off with the opening goal.The other big call made by the manager was the choice of striker.Jason Cummings and Osman Sow are the big-name frontmen and are the joint top scorers this term.However, Mullen is just one behind them in the scoring stakes and brought an energy to the frontline that proved so crucial.Much of Dundee’s joy came from harrying the Killie backline, forcing mistakes from a defence that has proved so brittle this season.The former Livingston and St Mirren frontman was the first line of that defence and powered through a massive amount of work.Though he’s the shortest of the three, Mullen is more of a threat in the air than both Cummings and Sow and that was crucial at times as well with conditions meaning few chances were taken in defence.He proved that with the opening goal, bringing a top save from the goalkeeper that gave McGhee the chance to bundle in the rebound.Sometimes it was a case of punting the ball forward and playing from there – that requires a forward fighting for everything and Mullen is the man for that task.He showed that again, though it proved the undoing of the Dundee defence when he moved to the right wing after the introduction of Sow.Chasing back to help out, Mullen threw himself in front of a shot from Killie’s Brandon Haunstrup only to see the ball fall perfectly into the full-back’s path, allowing him to score.Though he didn’t manage a goal, the striker played a key role in the victory.Throughout the first leg, Tommy Wright’s side were a shadow of the team that finished in third place just two years ago.Looking shorn of confidence throughout, how they find themselves on the brink of relegation was clear at Dens Park.Early on their tactic seemed to get balls down the side and in behind Dundee’s centre-backs Fontaine and Lee Ashcroft for dangerman Kyle Lafferty.Aside from an early effort from the Northern Ireland international, the Dark Blues shut that door and kept the striker quiet throughout.Killie’s quality is in their frontline but Haunstrup’s goal was their only shot on target # and that came with more than a little luck.On their home turf with fans at their backs, Dundee are prepared for a much-improved performance from their Premiership opponents on Monday night.Against this Dark Blues side it’ll need to be.Conditions surely can’t be as bad on Monday night at Rugby Park as they were at Dens.However, the message is likely to be ‘same again, boys’ from manager McPake.Sitting on a lead hasn’t been Dundee’s forte this season and it’s unlikely to be the game plan for the second leg.The Dark Blues showed with the energy of Mullen, McGhee, Byrne and McMullan they weren’t going to let Killie have any easy possession.With confidence low for the Premiership side that has to be continued throughout the second  minutes.Not one Dee came out of the first leg with anything less than an eight out of . That’ll be the requirement again in the second.Avoiding defeat at Rugby Park will see them back in the Premiership.Just one match away, Dundee are on the verge.EXCLUSIVE: Paul McGowan opens up on making  appearances # #I#ve loved every minute of being a Dundee player but winning promotion would top the lot#\" title\"#EXCLUSIVE: Paul McGowan opens up on making  appearances # #I#ve loved every minute of being a Dundee player but winning promotion would top the lot## # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  exclusive-dundee-stalwart-paul-mcgowan-opens-up-on-making--appearances-ive-loved-every-minute-of-being-a-dundee-player-but-winning-promotion-would-top-the-lot embed # secretmUhdofRoV\" data-secret\"mUhdofRoV\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-its-best-city-world---alexanders-gallowgate-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I remember being scared when the bombs were dropping on Glasgow during the Second World War."},{"url":null,"title":"louisa-jordan-katherine-watt---great-glasgow-nurses-celebrated-international-nurses-day","story":"WE all have a reason to be grateful for nurses and today is all about a celebration in their honour."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-janey-buchan-fierce-glasgow-mep-fought-civil-rights","story":" Janey Buchan was a fierce cultural and political activist.

The mum-of-two added she is now back in hospital for kidney stone treatment.According to the NHS, in the UK around one in every  pregnancies end up being ectopic # that equates to around , pregnancies a year.An ectopic pregnancy is caused by a fertilised egg implanting itself outside of the womb, usually in a woman#s fallopian tube.If an egg becomes stuck in a fallopian tube then the baby won#t develop and a woman#s le can be at riskthe condition were to go undetected.Sadly, an ectopic pregnancy means the baby cannot be saved. The fertilised egg will need to be removed. In order to do so, surgeons will either perform an operation or a woman will be given an injection of methotrexate which stops the pregnancy growing.Some women will never know the concrete facts behind what caused them to suffer an ectopic pregnancy.However, there are some factors which can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy.These factors include pelvic inflammatory disease , having a previous ectopic pregnancy, previous surgery on the fallopian tubes, fertility treatment such as IVF , falling pregnant while using an intrauterine device for contraception, falling pregnant over the age of , and smoking.If symptoms do appear, they tend to develop between weeks four and  of pregnancy. On occasion, an ectopic pregnancy won#t present any symptoms and may only be picked up during an ultrasound scan.Symptoms can include tummy pain low down on one side, vaginal bleeding or a brown watery discharge, shoulder tip pain, or discomfort when passing urine or stools.However, it#s important to know these symptoms may not always mean there is an ectopic pregnancy and could be caused by other conditions.Like Cara Kilbey, sometimes an ectopic pregnancy can be le threatening and may require emergency treatment.Fortunately, it#s uncommon for an ectopic pregnancy to result in a fallopian tube rupturing . Butit does occur the fallopian tube will need to be repaired or removed as soon as possible.A ruptured fallopian tube may cause one or more of the following symptoms a sharp, sudden and intense abdominal pain, feeling dizzy, sick or fainting or looking very pale.If a person suspects a rupture they should call  immediately.Suffering an ectopic pregnancy is traumatic and can cause a great deal of grief and stress for both a woman and her family.It#s important during such a dficult time to seek help and support from family and friends.A number of support groups are also available for women and their families to contact following a pregnancy loss.NHS Grampian guides women who have suffered from an ectopic pregnancy to a number of dferent support groups. The health board also offers the opportunity to speak to a bereavement support midwe for the area.

This  gives trainees access to the continent’s leading surgeons for each subject.#We are so grateful to have had such a great team work on this project, collaborating alongside COSECSA and WACS # who were able to make the  as comprehensive # and relevant # as possible.#It’s the first  that’s fundamentally created by African surgeons for African surgeons, which we hope will support and enhance existing mentor-based training systems.“Ultimately our ambition is to find the gaps and find the best ways to support junior doctors through their studies with resources to help drive the quality, skill-sets and confidence of new graduates.#We want to help scale the workforce and this  will allow recent and updated research and techniques to be shared by professionals to support trainees.#KidsOR was founded by Mr Wood and his we Nicola in  and creates modern, safe surgical theatres in developing countries. Each year, more children in Africa die of surgically treatable injuries than HIV, TB and Malaria combined.Professor Emmanuel Ameh, chief consultant paediatric surgeon at National Hospital in Abuja, said: #The e-learning  is coming at a time of increased momentum in efforts to scale up access to safe, affordable and timely surgical care for children.#It is unique in that it’s more than a textbook, it leverages technology to provide an engaging and rewarding learning experience.

This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It involves GPs, nurses, an army of health professionals and lots of support staff. It is essentialwe are to achieve what the publicsay is a priority, enjoying a healthy le.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.

Ignore a small path to your right and continue to a T-junction.Turn rightpast the village playing fields, with woods to your left. After m, turn left at a fork in the track into the woodland .The track meets the other route just ahead. Veering left your path climbs noticeably over the next .km, through plantations, past the reservoir off to the right # worth a small detour # until arriving at a junction.The Kintyre Way continues north whereas your path heads sharply left to continue up the hill.The next section opens out and is a lovely part of the walk, with excellent views back to Arran.After a few minutes, and as the path heads south on the higher section, look for the path to the summit on your right.It is now a very short hop to the summit Trig pointfor some lovely views right down Kintyre and towards Ailsa Craig.Although known as Deer Hill, Cnoc an Ghabar translates as Goat Hill I suspect there will be an explanation!Return to the path, meandering southwards for .km, with the odd little up and plenty of steep downs, passing back into the woodland where it meets another track.Turn left and look out for the path right just over m ahead.

This also allows closer inspection of the amazing folded Dalradian rocks.Once back at the bay # where you may decide a swim is in order # head right up the track from the carpark at its eastern end.After a gate you will be in fields which may have livestock. Veer sharp left at the other side of the first field and follow the track to another gate out on to a lane.Head straight ahead toto Carradale village and the main road. Right will take you back down to the harbour and past potential refreshments.*You can also follow part of the coast or go over the top to Port Righand along the edge of the golf course via Airds Castle ruins before dropping back down to Carradale harbour.

With their strong Gaelic and Norse heritage they defied the will of kings, and their political influence was undeniable.This independence of spirit might account, in part at least, for a modern-day habit of Islay folk # to enter the world of politics.With the election earlier this month of Jenni Minto as constituency MSP, the island now has three serving Argyll and Bute politicians, with council leader Councillor Robin Currie and Councillor Alastair Redman.Orkney and Shetland LibDem MP Alistair Carmichael, another Ileach, can be added to the list # and there may be more out there.Then there is George Robertson # now Lord Robertson of Port Ellen # former Labour politician and Secretary General of NATO, and the much-respected late Labour leader John Smith, both of whom have Islay connections.All of the above from an island of little more than , people.The Argyllshire Advertiser decided to ask the politicians themselves for their theories about why Islay has the habit of producing a preponderance of politicians.Leader of Argyll and Bute Council Robin Currie explained: #Ileachs are known for their sense of community, their enthusiasm for their island and their culture, and their erse mix of skills and resilience # so it#s no surprise that so many of us want to take that a stage further by representing not only our own island but the whole of Argyll and Bute, or indeed the country itself, as is the case with George Robertson and the late John Smith.#All of these characteristics will stand anyone in good stead when it comes to le as an elected representative, whether that’s at local or national government level.#It#s great that [in Argyll and Bute] we have a good balance of elected representatives of all political flavours, who understand the needs and characteristics of that mix of communities, and who can bring that knowledge together to work on issues of strategic as well as local importance.#Councillor Currie added: #It goes without saying that I wish my fellow Ileach, Jenni Minto, every success in her new role and I look forward to working with her.#Conservative Alastair Redman # one of three councillors serving Kintyre and the Isles alongside Councillor Currieand Tarbert#s Anne Horn# pointed to Islay#s #unique economy and location# as part of the reason for its political prominence.#Islay is both rural and at the same time heavily industrialised with our large number of distilleries,# he said.#It might be considered isolated yet is a global trading powerhouse. We on Islay have a population of just a few thousand yet our name is world famous.#There is also our history which to a degree separates us from mainland Scotland. Finlaggan was the seat of the Lords of the Isles under Clan Donald with roots that go back beyond the Kingdom of Scotland, beginning with Somerled in the th century.#I feel that this has led to Ileachs being more independent and perhaps at times more forthright than others.#I hope that many more councillors, MSPs, MPs, cabinet ministers, lords and even prime ministers will come from my home island which, though small, has made a huge mark on this world.#The last word goes to the newest member of Islay#s political gang, Jenni Minto MSP.The SNP member also cited the island#s past influence on Scottish politics through Finlaggan and the Lordship of the Isles.And she highlighted more examples of single-minded Ileachs making their mark on the world.#In - three ships with Islay people on board sailed for the New York colony,# said Ms Minto.#On one of these was five-year-old Alexander McDougall, who became a key figure in America’s war for independence. He had a very successful le, rising to the rank of Major General in the continental army. He then entered public service and was elected to the New York state senate. On his death he was described by George Washington as one of the five pillars of the American revolution.##I am not Islay-born,# she continued, #but feel very lucky to live on such a wonderful island. I often describe it as the centre of the universe, and there are very few places you can visit without meeting someone from Islay or someone who has a connection with the island.#I think that coming from, or living on, an island you need a level of resilience and creativity but you also have a true sense of community and working together.#Islay is also known to be a friendly place, where everyone has time to chat and listen to other people’s thoughts and views.#I think all of these traits are needed in politics and so perhaps it is not a surprise that Islay people have entered public service.#PICS:Jenni Minto MSP. no_aScotElection_McglynnArgyll and Bute Council leader, Robin Currie. aelectionCurrienoCouncillor Alastair Redman.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"reduce farm costs save time and make life easier","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Do not touch the fabric tipof the swab.Open your mouth wide and rub the fabric tip over both tonsils . Do this  times on each side. Itrsquos normal to find this a bit uncomfortable.Using the same swab, insert it up your nostril until you feel resistance.Rotate the swab in your nostril  times.Pick up the extraction tube, open the lid and place the fabric tip of the swab in the fluid in the tube.Firmly press the swab against the bottom-inside of the tube and rotate it around for  seconds. Itrsquos important to mix thoroughly.Pinch the tube as you remove the swab and put the nozzle cap on.Squeeze the extraction tube to place two drops of fluid on the test strip. Watch out for any air bubbles.Set a timer for  minutes and leave the test strip on a clean, flat surface.Once your test is complete, place all used test kit contents in the waste bag provided and put this in your bin.Where testing takes place - community testing sitesIfyou do not have coronavirus symptoms but live in a community that has been targeted for testing, you can access a test at a rapid test site.These are only available in some parts of Scotland.You can usually just turn up and do not need to book in advance ndash but you should check the arrangements at your local site first.You will be tested using a lateral flow devicewhich involves taking a swab or saliva sample.You should usually get your result within an hour.Island testingThe First Minister also added that people visiting the islands should take two lateral flow tests before travelling.Nicola Sturgeon said: \"We are keeping island communities at the same level as the rest of the country at the moment, so that we can allow travel between island communities and the rest of Scotland.\"But we know this does create a risk for our island communities.\"Many of them currently have very, very low rates of Covid.\"And they will be welcoming visitors from parts of Scotland which I know many of them are looking forward to where Covid will still be circulating at a higher level and more widely.\"So If you are planning to travel to an island we do encourage you to take two lateral flow tests before you depart.\"The second test should be on the day that you are planning to travel, and the first should be three days before you travel.\"That means thatyou test positive, you have a chance to take a PCR test - which is more sensitive - to confirm the result before making a final decision on cancelling your visit.\"This is potentially an important way in which we can minimise the risk, of bringing Covid into island communities while nevertheless allowing our island communities the benefit of opening up again to visitors.\"Soyou are planning on travelling to an island over the course of next week, it is possible to get tests from today, and I would encourage you to do that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"times-league-table-borders-high-schools-appear-top-50","story":"A LEAGUE table of Scottish secondary schools has been published by The Timesndash and the Borders has two in the top .The newspaper creates rankings every year based on the proportion of pupils achieving five or more Highers.This years editionwas published in print on Wednesday, May , showing a total of  schools in the country.GalashielsAcademy has risen by more than  places compared with last years chart.The Elm Row school is now in th place ndash up from last yearrsquos finish of th, as reported in the print edition of The Times.: Talented executive director is leaving Scottish Borders Council for new jobAccording to the latest statistics,  per cent of Gala Academy pupils achieved five or more Highers in .That is up on , which saw  per cent of Gala pupils complete the feat.In this yearrsquos table, only Earlston High Schooland Peebles High Schoolfinished above Gala Academy among the high schools in the Borders.Sixty-seven per cent of pupils at Earlston managed five or more Highers in , an increase of  per cent on rsquos figure .Meanwhile,  per cent of Peebles High pupils achieved five or more Highers last year, up from  per cent in .: Historic mansion near Borders saved from demolition following outcry over plansThe other Borders schools named in the rankings were Jedburgh Grammar School , Selkirk High School , Berwickshire High School , Kelso High School , Eyemouth High Schooland Hawick High School .As a region, the Borders council area was th in a league table of Scottish councils after . per cent of pupils graduated with five or more Highers.That is a . per cent increase on rsquos figure .A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \"There is a lot of good work going on right across the nine high schools in the Borders and it should be noted that there are a number of dferent ways of measuring the health and success of a school.\"The top performing school in the latest table based on this metric was Jordanhill School, Glasgow, which recorded an  per cent success rate of pupils recording five or more Highers.The lowest performing school was Craigroyston Community High School, Edinburgh, which recorded nine per cent of pupils achieving the feat."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-vaccine-passport-scheme-announced-scotland","story":"A new scheme that will allow Scots to prove they have been vaccinated against coronavirus before travelling abroad has been launched by the Scottish Government.Those who have been vaccinated can download a letter from the NHS Inform patient website, or request a letter from the Covid Status Helplinethey are not online.But as details of the vaccination status scheme were announced, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith urged people to be \"highly cautious about international travel\"and ldquocontinue to limit their travel abroad.Only those travelling to a country where proof of vaccination is needed as an entry requirement should request a letter.There are currently no countries that require travellers to show their vaccination status, but the letter scheme is being introduced because international travel requirements can change quickly during the pandemic.What to do before going abroad:If yoursquore planning to travel abroad, you must:check whether a country yoursquore travelling to is on the red, amber or green listconfirm what you need to do when you arrive back in ScotlandCountries may move between the green, amber and red lists at short notice.You should not assume that a country on the green, amber or red list now will remain on the same list over the weeks and months ahead.Before you travelYoull also need to:have taken a coronavirus testin the threedays before you begin your journey to Scotland -

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance.

Known only to the world mysteriously as #Pat#, he decided to part with his , bottle library last year, through a series of auctions, with a mission to share his passion for whisky with the world by passing his bottles on to new owners.Joe Wilson, head of auction content at Whisky Auctioneer, said: #Fèis Ìle is an iconic celebration of whisky and Islay culture that draws people back to the island year after year.#From Port Ellen to Bowmore and Bruichladdich to Ardbeg, this collection of Fèis Ìle bottlings is without a doubt the largest and most complete we have ever encountered.#The auction presents the rare opportunity for collectors and whisky drinkers to acquire some incredibly scarce malts that have been produced to celebrate the history of this iconic whisky region.#Examples from each of Islay#s eight single-malt producing distilleries feature in the sale, including complete collections of every single limited edition festival bottling from distilleries including Bowmore, Laphroaig and Lagavulin.The sale also features bottles that have been donated to the Fèis Ìle committee by distilleries to raise charitable funds for the island through their Islay Wave Project, which will focus on ways to support culture, artists and youth.Included in the charity lots is the oldest and rarest release directly from the iconic Islay distillery, Port Ellen. The Port Ellen -year-old # Rogue Casks# is the second release in the #Untold Stories# series, which explores the intriguing history of the Islay distillery ahead of its re-opening after closure almost three decades ago.Florence Grey, chairperson of the Fèis Ìle committee, said: #Fèis Ìle was delighted to be given the bottles in this charity auction from Diageo, plus a signed bottle from the legendary Islay whisky maker Jim McEwan.#All the proceeds raised from these bottles will benefit our island community as the funds will kickstart our Islay Wave Project # an ongoing project that will begin after this year#s virtual festival.#Focusing on ways to support our island#s culture, artists and youth, The Islay Wave Project concentrates on everything we celebrate throughout Fèis Ìle.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in.

stage.\"I know, not least because I live in Glasgow myself, how unwelcome this is for iniduals and businesses - but I hope it wont be for much longer.\"Nicola Sturgeon announced that East Renfrewshire will stay in Level  despite high case numbers.The First Minister said: \"On the face of it, levels in East Renfrewshire - as a proportion of the population - are actually slightly higher than in Glasgow.\"Im acutely aware that people might therefore look at the raw data and sayGlasgow is in Level , East Renfrewshire should be there too.\"But as youve heard me say many times before, and I know this is really dficult, the situation underneath the raw data is often more complex and its the detailed analysis that we must try to base our decisions on.\"For example, while the cases per , in Glasgow and East Renfrewshire are similar, the total number of cases in East Renfrewshire - because its a smaller area, obviously - is signicantly smaller than in Glasgow.\"To illustrate that, yesterday there were actually just  new cases reported in East Renfrewshire - compared to  in Glasgow. More importantly, many more of the cases in East Renfrewshire can be traced to specic household clusters, unlike in Glasgow.\"That means that we think strong and targeted public health measures have more of a chance of stemming the rise in East Renfrewshire, without the need to use wider restrictions.\"Taking all of that into account, our judgement - and these decisions are often finely balanced - is that East Renfrewshire should stay at Level  for now, although this will be kept under close review and well continue to use enhanced public health measures.\"Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that Moray will move to Level  from midnight tonight.Ms Sturgeon said: \"Im very pleased to say that the situation has actually improved very signicantly.\"Last week, the area was reporting  new cases a week per , -

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating.

Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

In a time of uncertainty, authentic leadership is something we can lean on.Authentic people make the best leaders. They seem trustworthy because theyrsquore not masking their intentions, say when they donrsquot have the answers, listen to others, and admit their mistakes. An authentic leader wants respect not admiration. Theyrsquore not propped up by sycophants, and they know that some decisions will be unpopular.When it comes to leadership, a \"one size fits all\" image persists: a loud, dominating decision-maker. There remains a focus on the title of \"leader\", but leading is an activity not a position, and effective leadership is about other people. Itrsquos not about you.Servant leadership puts othersrsquo needs at the forefront. It is simple ndash listen, understand, have an open dialogue ndash but it is harder in practice. A good starting point for anyone considering leadership is thinking about why you want to be a leader. If itrsquos because of the status, you wonrsquot get far. If itrsquos to invest in positive outcomes for others, yoursquore on the right road.We struggle with trust when it comes to public leadership. Saying one thing and doing another giving no clear explanation of motive and intention and making decisions in an opaque way erodes our trust in leaders. \"The buck stops with me\" is a phrase often heard from leaders, but strong, effective leaders donrsquot make decisions by themselves. They let others lead and listen to their expertise ndash and trust it.Values are trumpeted in politics, business and sport endlessly talked about, enshrined in strategies, painted on office walls. But they need to be demonstrated every day in what you do as a leader.Integrity is another buzzword. But what does it mean to you as a leader  Is it just \"doing the right thing\"  Making decisions that are unpopular in the short-term because they will have a long-term benefit  With servant leadership, the focus is on needs more than feelings. A leader shouldnrsquot strive for popularity. If people feel aggrieved about a decision, listen to them, but it is the need that comes first.Is there such thing as a \"natural leader\"  We hear that term all the time, as though there are iniduals born with innate leadership skills. But the activity of leadership is learned ndash through experience, peer-to-peer learning, and practice. It also implies that those with natural ability do not need additional training to adapt to changes.The problem with the \"natural leader\" is that it forms an exclusive club. Open up leadership through learning and you share decision-making, hear more voices, understand others, have stronger and better ideas that serve more of society.As we face post-pandemic challenges, trust is more important than ever. Leaders will have to rebuild trust publicly, and those who embrace authenticity will create a better world.Eleacutena Hogarth is co-founder of Compass Consultancy, a Scottish start-up that delivers leadership training.

The only viable United Kingdom, now, is a looser kingdom at ease with its many identities and embracing its political ersity and by Mr Eslerrsquos ldquoHome Rule for All Nations will not be easy. But it is probably the last chance of saving the many good things about our United Kingdom, building upon the UKrsquos existing quasi-federal structure being the obvious way to proceed.Furthermore a reading of both reveals that the more rational Scottish nationalists recognise that in this day and age there can be no ldquoabsolute independence and as a consequence it is not entirely inconceivable that they and the ldquofederalists may not be so far apart when it comes to the crunch, the minorities of ultra unionists and Scottish nationalists being the only opposition to the achievement of a reasonable solution.And so the UK needs a Devo Max movement, the core of which is surely to be found in the Labour Party ldquowith Sir Keir Starmerrsquos idea of a constitutional convention being a reasonable first step , as Mr Esler suggests.John Milne, Uddingston.WHY SHOULD WE JUMP OFF A CLIFF NICOLA Sturgeon rightly said in her acceptance speech on re-election as First Minister, that those of who do not support independence cannot be ldquobludgeoned towards an outcome you have not been persuaded of.:Iain Macwhirter: Time to cancel university bosses who violate laws on free speechWith those words the First Minister sums up how it has felt living over the last many years in Scotland, for those who value what we share with our fellow citizens across the UK.Day in, day out, the heavy hand of Scottish nationalism has made its presence felt, badly mismanaging critical public services like education, whilst simultaneously seeking to impose a ldquowe-know-best attitude into many aspects of our lives. All the while, the SNP leadership has used every opportunity to stir grievance against the UK, promoting ision rather than recognising the benefits of working positively together.Despite warm-sounding political spin, the First Ministerrsquos acceptance speech reasserts the SNPrsquos determination to impose its will on the half of Scotland who oppose it. Meanwhile, we have no hint of clarity or honesty on reasonable concerns over the challenges the SNPrsquos overriding objective will likely mean for us.As some countries look forward to enjoying a period of calm normality once they emerge from the awful effects of Covid, our First Minister instead offers us a vision of ision and uncertainty.

Pete Townshend wrote: ldquoThe simple things you see are all complicated.This perfectly describes atmospheric processes.The basics are simple. Earthrsquos atmosphere is absorbing and retaining more solar energy as this is trapped by greenhouse gases. This energy is either dissipated or stored in a iety of ways, with dferent outcomes, all governed by basic physical processes. The atmosphere behaves in line with the combined gas laws. Pressure, volume and temperature constantly interact.Kinetic is movement energy, of both wind and water. More atmospheric energy will mean more wind, bigger waves, and even faster or disrupted flows of ocean currents. A present benefit to us is that the Forth and Clyde are not icebound in winter.More kinetic energy means peak events like hurricanes are likely to be more powerful.Storm energy can be dissipated in electric storms like thundersnow, once rare, now frequent.Both atmosphere and oceans may absorb more heat energy, so temperatures rise.Warmer oceans hold more dissolved gases, becoming more acid. This can have a dramatic effect on marine lersquos ability to survive, corals being a sensitive le form. Corals store carbonates in their reefs. This is a knock-on impact. Fewer corals means less take-up of carbon. These feedback loops intensy climate change impacts.Warmer air in higher latitudes and altitudes will melt more polar and glacier ice. Oceanic thermal expansion will also cause sea level rise,it is not sea ice.The albedo effect ndash reflectivity ndash complicates ice loss impacts. Open sea, formerly ice-covered, absorbs more heat energy than highly reflective ice floes, thus allowing more rapid heat transfers in high latitude oceans. This then accelerates further ice melt.Another basic physical process ndash latent heat, or conversion energy, governs the melting of ice into water . Ice melting, in huge masses, requires a much larger energy transfer than just raising it from -C to C.Mass transfers of energy are needed to drive the hydrological cycle. Water vapour evaporates from the seas, condenses into clouds, then rain or snow.More energy can mean higher rain or snowfall. Additional cloud cover reflects more solar energy so we also have to account for a mitigating impact.Yet, some large air masses stall and produce longer periods of stable drier or hotter weather leading to droughts, and increased fire risk, especially in Mediterranean climates.These are all energy transfers. Feedback loops within these systems then either accelerate or slow processes. It isnrsquot a neat linear progression.Climate is the average weather over a -year cycle. Single weeks, months, even years can erge from the overall direction of longer term trends. Such is \"bias\" or \"noise\". No atmospheric scientist will say any single peak event is definitely caused by climate change. Yet over time more storms and powerful weather events are likely.One of the problems of climate change is that fish donrsquot see water. Wersquore immersed in daily weather patterns so the bigger picture is often concealed.Mr Crossrsquos piscine observations are one such example.Tony Philpin, Gigha.LOCKDOWNS ARE NOT THE ANSWERGLASGOW is facing a lockdown extension . But there are many scientic studies that cast doubt on the efficacy of lockdowns. For example, in December a Korean team led by S Hong published a study which says that, except for school closures and contact tracing, all non-clinical Covid measures ldquoare proven to be statistically insignicant or even have a negative impact.A Stanford team led by E Bendavid published a paper in January which says ldquothere is no evidence that more restrictive nonpharmaceutical interventionscontributed substantially to bending the curve of new cases in England, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain or the US in early .And in February a Canadian study published by A Joffe says that the recession and austerity resulting from government lockdowns ldquocan be expected to cause far more loss of le and well-being over the long run than Covid- can.Government ministers and advisors should be askedtheyre willing to forego their salaries for the duration of any lockdown.Geoff Moore, Alness.BBC SHOULD AXE QUESTION TIMERON McKays comments on Question Timehit the mark.

So much so, several could pass for ldquomust have qualities of the successful modern politician, particularly at Westminster. Letrsquos take greed as an example, as itrsquos present in all parties. Peter Mandelson, that pillar of socialist principle and asceticism, was ldquointensely relaxed about people becoming filthy rich. To be fair he did add, ldquo they paid their taxes. But thatrsquos a big . Therersquos little doubt however, itrsquos in Conservative ranks that greed is writ largest.Margaret Thatcherrsquos economic mentor, Milton Friedman, asked: ldquoIs there some society that doesnrsquot run on greed  That alternative interpretation of greed as a virtue is still at the heart of present-day Conservatism. The Prime Minister sets the tone. Should there be a vacancy for a visual aid to illustrate the Seven Sins, Mr Johnson would be a shoe-in. Like Lord Mandelson, he has no problem with greed. At a recent  Committee meeting, Mr Johnson declared: ldquoThe reason we have the vaccine success is because of capitalism, because of greed my friends. Mr Johnsonrsquos brain rarely operates in advance of his mouth, but even by his standards that was pushing the envelope a little too far. Signicantly, there is no record of cries of dissent from his audience.Read more:Coronavirus: Why we need to show animals more respect ndash our lives depend on itMr Johnson was talking characteristic nonsense. In truth, vaccine development and rollout represent principles much more noble than greed. Big Pharma does not have a reputation for altruism and philanthropy. Nevertheless, AstraZeneca for example, was not profit-driven in developing and delivering its vaccine. So far at least, it has made the vaccine available at cost. The success of the massive vaccination programme is not down to money-grabbing, outsourced ldquocontractors. It has been delivered effectively through the NHS, the ultimate example of selfless service and humanity qualities regularly derided by free market economists and politicians.We would all have been up the proverbial creek without a paddle had essential workers like health professionals been motivated by greed. According to the doubtful economic and moral codes favoured by the likes of the Prime Minister and Friedman, those workers would have been justied in withdrawing their labour unless they received massive pay hikes.The catastrophic and ruinously expensive failures have all been in areas entrusted to the greed-driven private sector. In those areas, the UK Government chose to outsource rather than use local knowledge and experience. The disastrous Track and Trace programme, including the fabled ldquomoon shot, lined the pockets of contractors and consultants and wasted at least pound billion. It was a similar story when it came to the supply of PPE. The crony-virus ensured Tory chums of doubtful provenance were offered blank cheques to supply equipment, not all of which proved useable. Greed not only failed to deliver, but as the National Audit Office reported, the public purse was ripped off for at least poundbn. Author Kurt Vonnegut hit the nail on the head when suggesting in greedy societies, praise is reserved ldquofor those who devised means of getting paid enormously for committing crimes against which no laws have been passed.A fish rots from the head down. The Prime Minister appears to believe his annual salary of around pound, is insufficient for home improvements and childcare. To be fair, Mr Johnson is simply following in the footsteps of some of his predecessors, including David Cameron. On leaving office, Mr Cameron admits to have been paid ldquoa generous amount by Greensill Capital, declining to provide a figure. He also appears to have benefited from ldquosleazyjet flights to his third home courtesy of his employer.Read more:Elections: Old time politics were enriched by the lost art of hecklingMany of the wealthiest are mystied by the concepts of service and altruism.

When the Scottish Government was considering increased levels of taxation for high earners, it was claimed profit would trump social obligation and they would decamp en masse to England. Yet, there is little evidence of the ldquotrickle down effect from the wealthiest to the poorest in society. Perversely, itrsquos often the poorest who are the most generous spirits.

Nowadays, most of the sins have been rehabilitated and run through politics and business, like lettering through a stick of rock.

For instance, as I write, the Public Health Scotland website shows that in the previous seven days there were between zero and two cases of Covid in any of the wards that make up Drumchapel, and yet their , residents are in lockdown in Level . Conversely, there are people who live in South Lanarkshire who live less than two miles from Glasgow Cross who will enjoy the freedoms of Level  while their Glasgow neighbours are under much stricter regimes.This treatment of Glasgow residents is a double failure. First was that of the Tories in the s. The second is that of the imagination and intelligence of Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government, who could so easily use postcodes or city wards to make better sense and create more liberty for most Glaswegians, while concentrating attention on specic areas which require special attention.We also have to wonder just quite where Susan Aitken and Glasgow City Council are in all this. I can hardly imagine past Labour leaders like my old bosses Jean McFadden and Pat Lally being silent in these circumstances.

On reaching the coast of Gujarat, Gandhi collected a few tiny grains of salt on the sea-shore, thus breaking the law.In , in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks was tired after a long day at work and sat on a seat near the front of the bus, rather than stand at the back with those others of her skin colour.

That didnrsquot end well for the British Empire. Sometimes itrsquos right to protest against the enforcement of laws, as David Gray argued .Mr Johnston suggests the two men seized by UK Border Force were Sikh. I remind him that thousands of Sikhs gave their lives for the British Empire in two world wars. After the first, in Amritsar in , British Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer marched his men into Jallianwala Bagh, near the Sikh Golden Temple, and opened fire on a crowd of men, women and children peacefully celebrating Baisakhi, killing around  and injuring another ,.And after the Sikh and Indian sacrices of the Second World War, Mountbatten and his fellow rulers of the British Raj drew a ragged line on the map splitting Punjab in two, then scurried out of India leaving carnage behind. More than million people were displaced most estimates of the death toll from partition are of over a million, many of them Sikh. Just as we owe a debt to the Windrush generation, so too do we owe a debt to Sikhs.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.KEEP AN OPEN MIND ON ENERGYSOME recent letters regarding mains electrical power provision reveal, in my opinion, partisan attachments for or against certain power generation methods. Why, I do not know, for this a practical matter which depends on established facts, the most important of which is that wind turbines are used in large numbers in many countries.Wind energy which cannot be used due to lack of demand, can be stored by pumped storage hydrogen generation by electrolysis as \"heat\" stored in the \"cold\" source of heat pumps, and batteries.Pumped storage is a proven technology which has been in use in the UK for decades . Hydrogen generation on a large scale presents no special dficulties. Hydrogen has two main uses ndash to augment the natural gas system we already have and as fuel for internal combustion engines. Will a large investment in new technology be needed  Yes, but let us recall that a large investment was needed to produce our current system. It is very big and expensive, but essential to the society we have.Some argue that continuing to burn hydrocarbons is acceptablethe CO produced is stored under the seabed. This is possible but a risk of the stored CO leaking back into the environment exists. It is dficult to tell at presentthis will rule it out.If governments ban the release of CO into the atmosphere, developments in the areas described above will occur. A careful costing and risk assessment for all systems will be needed.John Fleming, Glasgow.WE MUST NOT HALT PROGRESSAUGUST naturalist and national treasure Sir David Attenborough has been named the \"peoplersquos advocate\" for COP in Glasgow.

No-one is actually harmed by this proto-censorship, apart from the students depriving themselves of the opportunity to learn. But things have taken a truly sinister turn in recent weeks.The lives of students like Lisa Keogh at Abertay, and lecturers like Dr Neil Thin at Edinburgh, are being destroyed by crack-handed inquisitions applying Monty Python concepts of justice. Lisa Keoghrsquos advocate, Joanna Cherry MP, has rightly condemned Abertayrsquos violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.:Michael Settle: The reinvention of Project Fear - but will it be a winning combination Highly-paid university principals should now be held to account for failing to defend free speech. Ms Keoghrsquos only crime was to express a wholly-respectable opinion in a debate. She insisted that ldquowomen have vaginas ndash an observation that is only a heresy to advocates of non-binary dogma.Dr Neil Thin was suspended from his role as a senior lecturer in anthropology for criticising the risible decision by Edinburgh University last year to ldquocancel Scotlandrsquos greatest philosopher by striking his name from the David Hume Tower. This for a footnote to an article in  that was disparaging about non-white races.Dr Thin was echoing the views of Scotlandrsquos leading historian, Sir Tom Devine. As former Rector of Edinburgh University I also expressed my dismay at this stupefying act of intellectual philistinism, which has made Edinburgh University an international joke. They had been intending to rename it ldquoJulius Nyerere Tower until someone pointed out that the late president of Tanzania was a homophobe as well as a dictator.I pointed out that its new official name, ldquo George Square, celebrates King George , an ardent imperialist who was responsible for an unprecedented expansion of British colonialism. But they didnrsquot get it.Many academics were horried at the Hume Tower affair, but they kept silent, terried of culture warrior retribution. Dr Thin also had the temerity to question whether a campus event called ldquoResisting Whiteness, which involved people of colour only, didnrsquot look just a bit like ldquosegregation. This elicited howls of protest at his ldquoracism.Any self-respecting institution of higher learning would dismiss such accusations as ridiculous. But principal Peter Mathieson suspended Dr Thin, following claims by students that his remarks were ldquoproblematic and ldquooffensive.What he should have done was censure the students who had called Dr Thin a racist, when he is clearly nothing of the sort. I have looked at the social media comments made by Dr Thin, and none of them could be regarded by any reasonable person as expressing racism. He said what any open-minded person would say about an event which was quite literally segregated on the basis of race. His support for Sir Tom Devine is what every self-respecting academic should have done.I donrsquot particularly blame the students of BlackED for mounting a daft, attention-seeking campaign. Thatrsquos what students do. But I do blame the university authorities for responding to it and validating what was in reality a campaign of intimidation and abuse against a member of staff. These extreme anti-colonialist and non-binary dogmas are usually referred to as ldquowoke, but they would be more accurately described as the sleep of reason. Universities are supposed to challenge dogmas and subject political ideas to rigorous criticism. Yet the university authorities seem to be falling over themselves to encourage these infant Robespierres with their empty slogans and pseudo-scientic jargon.:SNP urge Scottish Secretary to fight back or resign over Australia trade dealOver at Abertay University, principal Nigel Seaton last week defended his decision to conduct a disciplinary investigation into -year-old-mature law student Lisa Keogh for saying that ldquowomen have vaginas. This was in a debate where she was invited to state how she defined ldquowoman. She said that, in her opinion, it was essentially based on biology and a womanrsquos reproductive physiology. She also said that ldquomen are stronger than women on account of their sex, and that male-bodied transwomen should not be competing in womenrsquos sporting events. These are views that would be endorsed by the vast majority of adults, and indeed by Americarsquos leading transgender advocate, Caitlyn Jenner.Abertayrsquos response should have been to dismiss objections to her expressing these opinions in open debate. Yet, principal Seaton has authorised a disciplinary investigation into Lisa Keogh, threatening her with expulsion on the grounds that her views may be ldquooffensive and ldquodiscriminatory.:NEIL MACKAYS BIG READ: It was like Lord of the Flies - Horric accounts of abuse could be boarding schoolsrsquo lsquoMeToorsquo momentHe appears to believe that the university is under a legal obligation under equalities legislation to investigate complaints about comments that supposedly violate the protected characteristic of ldquogender reassignment.Principal Seaton is wrong. Equalities legislation does nothing of the sort. In fact, it upholds Lisa Keoghrsquos right to express her gender-critical opinion. This was made absolutely clear last month by Baroness Falkner, the new chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The views of feminists like Lisa Keogh are in no way discriminatory or hate speech. She said that it is ldquoentirely reasonable to believe that women are defined by their sex and no-one should be ldquopenalised or abused for saying so. ldquoSomeone can believe that people who self-identy as a dferent sex are not the dferent sex that they self-identy, she said.Arguably, it should be Abertayrsquos principal under investigation for conniving in this witch-hunt. In a dignied and restrained interview on BBC Womanrsquos Hour last week, Ms Keogh, a mother of two, explained the distress shersquod suffered being forced to defend herself against this Kafkaesque inquisition. In the midst of sitting her law exams she has had the threat of expulsion hanging over her. Not to mention the abuse she has received from student activists calling her ldquoa typical, cis white woman and much worse.These misguided and unlawful actions by university principals are creating a hostile environment in Scotlandrsquos universities. It extends far beyond Edinburgh and Abertay.The threat of sanctions or stressful disciplinary procedures is chilling debate and making lecturers hesitate to discuss controversial issues. Yet this is precisely what any university teacher should be doing. As for research,academics are looking over their shoulders at Twitter, nothing truly original will ever get done. Just a lot of advocacy research designed to confirm whatever prejudices are acceptable on social media.If universities do not enforce freedom of speech and opinion they cannot perform their proper . Scottish taxpayers expect them to do teaching and research ndash not pursue vendettas against wrongthink. Taxpayer-remunerated principals like Peter Mathieson, earning twice the Prime Ministerrsquos salary, are violating their own university charters, which uphold academic freedom and also free speech provisions of international conventions like the ECHR.:Heralds Higher Education Awards: Hard work and dedication pays off for finalistsNor do university bosses, minds addled by culture war, realise the reputational damage these cases are inflicting on their institutions. Edinburgh University used to get rectors like myself to schmooze rich, potential donors and wealthy American parents willing to pay exorbitant fees.

And rightly so.Placed in a football context, this wasnrsquot just the equivalent of Scotland going to the Euros. This was the same as Steve Clarkersquos men qualying and then going on to win the whole thing. And you can just imagine how the nation would react were that to come to pass this summer.Taylor has benefited from two things that have allowed him to become undisputed world champion after just  professional fights.One was the World Boxing Super Series , an innovative knock-out style competition that brought together most of the key players in the super-lightweight ision without the usual contractual haggling and posturing that often gets in the way of big fights getting made.Taylor was named in the eight-man tournament that began in late , giving him a clear route to aim at two world titles.Defeating Ryan Martin in the quarter-finals gave him a shot at the first ndash the IBF belt ndash which he took against Ivan Baranchyk in Glasgow.He then added a second by defeating No. seed Regis Prograis in the WBSS final in London, a victory that earned him both the Muhammad Ali trophy and the Americanrsquos WBA belt.The second thing that went in his favour on the road to becoming king of the ision was meeting a like-minded foe in Ramirez.While others with two world titles to their name might have held off and continued to pad their record with victories against lesser opponents, both Taylor and the Mexican-American were willing to risk everything to gain everything.That both are part of the Top Rank stable again took any politics out of the move, with ESPN also already on board to broadcast the bout throughout North America.It evidently gnawed at Taylor before the fight that no major UK broadcaster had shown sufficient interest, a surprise given BT Sportrsquos collaborative partnership with ESPN.Again, there are possible mitigating factors behind that. Ramirez was a unied world champion but he isnrsquot a ldquoname among casual boxing fans in the way that Terence Crawford and Manny Pacquiao both are.If Taylor were to move up to welterweight to fight either of those pair, then broadcasters will be throwing money at him for the right to screen it.Ramirez is also not a natural showman, not a trash talker or someone who contributes more to the boxing hype machine than he is obligated to.When it did start to get a bit personal in the build-up to Saturdayrsquos fight, it was Taylor who was attempting to crank it up, admitting later it was all just part of an attempt to throw his opponent off guard.Broadcasters tend to reflect public opinion with their choices and perhaps there is a large element of English boxing fans who simply canrsquot bring themselves to get behind a chippy, patriotic Scot, as Taylor unashamedly is.He also doesnrsquot have an Eddie Hearn or a Frank Warren to repeatedly talk him up as they do with their own fighters, with Taylor now promoted by  year-old Bob Arum, a legendary figure in boxing circles but not a regular on Sky Sports News or in the British press.Just like Andy Murray before him, Taylor has had to almost go over and beyond just to grudgingly receive Middle Englandrsquos seal of approval.The  year-old had predicted people couldnrsquot continue to ignore himhe came through Ramirez and that has already proved to be the case.In the immediate aftermath, however, Taylor was less fussed about courting new admirers and more interested in thanking those who have helped carry him this far.Those include his family and friends, his fianceacutee Danielle, and his hero and mentor Ken Buchanan, the last Scot to be declared undisputed world champion  years ago.Buchanan is  years old now and not in the best of health, but Taylor has not forgotten how important a role his predecessor played in sending him on his way.ldquoKen, what an inspiration yoursquove been since I was  and walked in the doors at Lochend Boxing Club, he said.ldquoMy coach back then Terry [McCormack] is in Vegas with me and has been like a dad to me. But Ken gave me bits of advice on how to live my le.ldquoHe told me how to train and dedicate myself to my sport. He saw me as an amateur hitting the bags and said I could be a world champion.ldquoHersquos been proven right and I canrsquot wait to go back and say ldquoIrsquom just like you, champ.As for the future, Taylor is remaining open-minded. Crawford, who put on a clinical performance to take Ricky Burnsrsquo lightweight world title from him on a memorable night in Glasgow in , would be a massive draw home or away but there will be other opportunities, too.ldquoWersquoll see what comes my way, added Taylor, munching pizza and already looking forward to what would have been the first of many celebratory beers.ldquoWe wonrsquot be short of options and every fight is going to be huge. Wersquoll ride the wave.ldquoIrsquod like to go up to  pounds and chase a real big fight like Crawford. I wonrsquot call him out. Hersquos a great fighter but two undisputed fighters at  lbs would be amazing.ldquoIrsquove not boxed in my home city since Miguel Vasquez at Ingliston out by the airport a few years ago so Irsquod love to take a big fight back to Scotland.ldquoNow is the time to get Edinburgh Castle or Easter Road. Irsquod love to fight at the castle. It would be iconic.ldquoThere are big fights and good fighters out there. But Irsquoll fight anybody in this game.Hersquos already shown as much.

The people of Scotland sent me a strong message that certainty carries great weight ndash a commitment to ensure the timeliness and quality of care, fairly, for one and all.We made a series of practical recommendations all of which were accepted by the Scottish parliament, but which were perhaps somewhat lost in the politics of subsequent governmental change.Never has the world been more interconnected, geopolitically, by air travel, in cyberspace, genetically and through generation of knowledge by transnational cooperation.Our NHS is under extraordinary pressure at the moment, facing an unprecedented challenge posed by COVID , a challenge which crosses all borders and binds all nationalities together. For me,we are to meet thesechallenges, it requires us to embrace the ldquothree Cs of my original report: cohesion, collaboration and cooperation.How far have we come If recent data are to be believed, not far enough. The envisaged Networks in which we hoped to see a greater degree of site specialisation and a better access to complex care have not come fully to fruition.I felt at the time that Scotland had done some great work in terms of delivering integrated care through telemedicine to more remote communities and would have hoped that more progress would have been made with a greater degree of governmental support.Of course, many improvements have happened since I made my report. Importantly, we see that there have been improvements in outcome from the major chronic diseases, a tribute to my healthcare colleagues and their multi-disciplinarity of approach.But current data shows that some key outcomes are getting worse, not better. For example, the National Records of Scotlandrsquos most recent report shows that, after falling in every year from  to , avoidable mortality in Scotland has now plateaued .In , nearly a third of all deaths ndash % - were considered avoidable. And, within Scotland, the gap between the health of the richest and the poorest is widening. The % most deprived Scots are nearly five times as likely to die from an avoidable death as someone in the top %.This is up from . times more likely compared to .Back in , I invited over  Scots to town hall meetings to give voice to their own aspirations for their NHS and a recurrent theme was to ensure equity of access to healthcare, across any social, ethnic or other perceived ides.This is a multaceted problem which requires joined up thinking and joined up government, transcending Ministerial departments and a frankly better performance than current evidence dictates. When the gap between the rich and the poor is widening, we must act with a greater degree of urgency.First of all, cohesion.We need to improve networks across healthcare in Scotland ndash the journey that patients take when they enter the health and social care system.In practical terms, this implies investment in patient pathways that span primary and secondary care, networks of rural hospitals linked to and supported by the major teaching hospitals, rational distribution of services between neighbouring hospitals and national planning of complex service frameworks like neurosurgery and specialised childrenrsquos services.The technological revolution, accelerated by how we are dealing with COVID, can also support a more cohesive health service. Big data and articial intelligence in medicine allows us to build better health profiles and better predictive models around inidual patients so that we can better diagnose and treat disease and understand how iniduals access the health service, to better match capacity and demand.Health care cannot be something done to us with the help of technology, it must become a genuine partnership between health professionals and citizens. For example, the new wearables under development, track specic health trends, and relay them to the cloud where physicians can monitor them.Patients suffering from asthma or blood pressure could benefit from it, or monitors for blood oxygen levels to monitor COVID patients at home with alerts to signal when further treatment might be needed, all of which confer more independence and reduce unnecessary visits to the doctor.The remorseless process of natural selection was summarised in October  by Robert Brook of the RAND Corporation, one of the pioneers of the quality revolution  years ago, in a leading article in the Journal of the American Medical Association entitled lsquoThe end of the quality improvement movement ndash long live improving valuersquo.As we emerge from the COVID pandemic, the ensuing global economic crisis will push value further up the health agenda. In every country, lsquovaluersquo is the key concept, and increasing value by improving outcome and reducing expenditure are the key challenges for those who deliver healthcare and those who receive it.Secondly, collaboration.We are never more united than when we face an existential threat such as the COVID  pandemic. We see high level collaboration between the four Chief Medical Officers presenting a calm, united and rational front.I am honoured to work in Oxford and have witnessed the extraordinary efforts of my colleagues who have delivered an effective vaccine and who have conducted the largest and most globally informative trials of new COVID  treatments.Around , patients in  hospital sites across the UK have been randomised to nine treatment arms, or to receive no additional treatment. During the first wave, over , patients were recruited in just two months, making it the fastest-recruiting randomised controlled trial and, in the second wave, over , patients were recruited in three weeks, demonstrating the power of unity and the necessity for collaboration across the entire UK.In my own field, medical researchers can use very large nationally collected data sets on treatment plans and recovery rates of cancer patients in order to find trends and therapies that have the highest rates of success in the real world, leading ultimately to better patient outcomes.Finally, cooperation. The Covid crisis has revealed just how much we require all levels of government to cooperate together when faced with a deadly, common threat. Whether it is in the supply of personal protective equipment, the roll out of a massive new testing system, or the delivery of the vaccine, we have relied on political leaders to find common cause.Together with Gordon Brown and the Our Scottish Future think-tank, we intend to make further recommendations over the coming period on how deeper cooperation across the UK can support the delivery of better healthcare for all citizens.This isnrsquot a constitutional iding line ndash itrsquos about finding practical ways to get the best out of our health care system, be it in the supply of medicine, the application of technology, or the fight against a pandemic.I have taken this final slide from our report of all those years ago ndash as true now as then, and let me ask you to judge for yourselves how far the last  years have taken us towards this enlightened model of how we might better deliver health to all of our folk.David Kerr is Professor of Cancer Medicine, University of Oxford, Honorary Consultant Medical Oncologist, Oxford Cancer CentreProfessorKerr was author of the National Framework for Service Change, commissioned by the then Scottish Executive in  ndash the most wide-ranging review of how to help the NHS in Scotland manage future demand and improve health."},{"url":null,"title":"steve-clarke-must-make-settling-scotland-defence-euro-2020-priority-sunshine-spanish-sojourn","story":"A limited number of fans will be allowed in to Hampden for the Group D matches against the Czech Republic and Croatia at Hampden and England at Wembley due to Covid- restrictions. It will not quite be the same as in years gone by. Still, a sense of anticipation is growing among the Tartan Army daily.Clarke will spend his time at the La Finca Resort in Costa Blanca bonding with his players, assessing their form and fitness and generally fine tuning preparations for the friendlies against the Netherlands in Portugal and Luxembourg in Luxembourg and the finals thereafter.The trip promises to be absolutely vital to the nation teamrsquos chances or progressing to the knockout rounds for the first time.Anyone who attempted to come up with the names that Clarke would plump for before the squad announcement last Wednesday would have found the vast majority of them pretty easy.David Marshall, Andy Robertson, Kieran Tierney, Grant Hanley, Stephen OrsquoDonnell, Stuart Armstrong, Scott McTominay, Callum McGregor, John McGinn, Ryan Fraser, Ryan Christie, Lyndon Dykes and Che Adams will be all be hoping to start and are certain to be involved in the match day fit and available.But deciding on the centre backs to take was far more problematic. Who partners Hanley and Tierney in the three man defence that Clarke is likely to once again put his faith in is anyonersquos guess. McTominay will, with Ryan Jack and Kenny McLean both sadly injured, be deployed in his favoured position in central midfield. So who does the manager go for Liam Cooper has helped Leeds United finish th in the Premier League, Jack Hendry of Celtic started in the Qatar  qualiers against Austria and Israel in March, Scott McKenna has had a fine season with Nottingham Forest and is experienced, Declan Gallagher of Motherwell was sensational in the Euro  play-off semi-final and final last year.Each contender has his strengths and his weaknesses. Cooper, Hendry and McKenna, and even Hanley for that matter, have never wholly convinced onlookers at international level. Gallagher has. But the less said about his performances for his club this term the better. He hasnrsquot always been fully fit and didnrsquot feature at any stage in the last triple header as a result.Personally, I would abandon the three man defence and switch to a back four. Yes, the --- worked well in those play-off triumphs against Israel and Serbia. But Scotland looked far more settled when they reverted to a --- at half-time against Israel in Tel Aviv in March. They change allowed them to equalise and salvage what could prove to be a vital away draw.Robertson is far better as a left back than a wing back. It gives the Liverpool defender the chance to make the same sort of impact as he has for the Anfield club domestically and in Europe in the past. Tierney, Hanley and OrsquoDonnell appeared comfortable with it too. Having two deep-lying midfielders just in front of them offered vital protection.Every supporter, of course, has an opinion on what is best. But sorting out the defence is the biggest quandry that Clarke faces.

We seek assurances, therefore, that  steps will be taken to ensure that this happens. Close collaboration with locally elected representatives, including the island authorities, will be important but we would encourage you and your officials to look at other ways of making sure this happens from the outset.“Needless to say, we would be happy to meet with you to discuss this matter in more detail.  Meantime, we wish you well in the substantial task that lies ahead and stand ready to assist, particularly in ensuring the needs of our islands are front and centre of government thinking.“We look forward to hearing from you in due course.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We did a huge amount of work including introducing a one-way system, social distancing measures and putting down markers,” said theatre manager Paul Baines. “One of the biggest challenges was getting people in and out safely.“We have to ensure the measures are genuine and effective and they are visible. Visible reassurance is important for customer confidence.“It is a juggling act because you have to balance creating a too clinical atmosphere with offering a unique theatre experience.”The theatre has been awarded the VisitEngland We’re Good to Go industry standard mark, signying that it adheres to government and public health COVID- guidance, also approved by UK Theatre Seat Safety.Alongside familiar COVID- safety measures, Rosie Fraser has introduced a new service called “Silent Treatment”.“We love a good chat but we also understand some people prefer not to,” said Rosie, whose beauty salon opened in .“Clients can see the service as soon as they look at the online booking menu and add it with whatever treatments they are having.“We still carry out a full consultation and then let them just relax.”Also in place are bespoke engraved screens between stations, extra time for cleaning, screening forms for track and trace, PPE and sanitising measures. Rosie emphasises that it is safety with style!

Safety processes include a digital thermometer mounted at the door which all staff and customers are required to pass before entering. Anyone recording a high temperature is refused admission.Hand sanitisers are also available. Kitchen and front of house staff are required to wear masks and wash their hands regularly. Tables and chairs are cleaned rigorously after every diner.

We’re constantly improving and we’re learning as we go on.”App orders and one-way systems will ensure ongoing safety. Outside seating, pods and marquee are also available. Misting machines, meanwhile, will keep hotels “squeaky clean – safe for staff and guests”.Meurig added: “There’s hand sanitiser outside every shop and we ask people to wear masks indoors, but not outside.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It acknowledges the anxiety that some travellers may have.Loganair chief commercial officer Kay Ryan said: ldquoWe are delighted to play a part in helping showcase Shetlandrsquos stunning scenery and all the great reasons to visit this beautul part of the United Kingdom.ldquoWe are also extremely mindful of our passengersrsquo well-being, and full details of our lsquoFlysafersquo healthy flying protocols are available on our website, along with our lsquoFlexprotectrsquo programme which outlines our flexible bookings conditions as we continue to transition out of travel restrictions.Shetlanders Neil and Natasha Clubb took part in the filming ndash spending the day as ldquotourists enjoying the scenery and famed islesrsquo hospitality.Mr Clubb said being involved was great fun.ldquoWersquove not told many people about it so I canrsquot wait until my friends in Glasgow see it on the TV and realise that itrsquos us,# he said.ldquoThe filming experience was really good fun. We had a whole night in Fjara filming and then down in St Ninianrsquos Isle and up in Eshaness. It was fascinating seeing how the filming is done.ldquoI hope the advert encourages people to come up to Shetland and enjoy all that it has to offer. Therersquos lots of opportunities to get outdoors, from cycling and paddle boarding to birdwatching and fishing. It really is an adventure playground.Although the finished project looks spectacular, the Shetland weather added an extra challenge for Burra-based film-maker Stephen Mercer.He shot the footage in April, during the cold snap that left snow lying on the ground for weeks. Mr Mercer said it was an interesting project and added that, frosty conditions aside, the ldquoamazing locations helped sell the destination.Promote Shetland is stressing the need for all visitors to exercise caution when travelling this year and has published guidance urging all tourists to take two lateral flow tests before making their journey.The project was supported by the STV Growth Fund and match-funding from Promote Shetland and Loganair...Ive been a reporter since  at newspapers in Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

Shetland’s location, island transport links, industries and dispersed rural population, are all seen as contributing factors to this statistic.SIC environment and transport committee chairman Ryan Thomson said: “I’d urge folk to give us their views on how we can all work towards reducing Shetland’s carbon footprint.“This survey is the start of our ‘climate conversation’ and an open dialogue with the community, including local businesses, organisations and iniduals.“As we look ahead to recover from the pandemic, Shetland is well placed to support a greener recovery and we all need to play our part.”The online survey is open to all Shetland residents.

The trio were cared for at the centre after a number of litters were seized at the port, with puppies being taken into the care of local dog rescues across Mid-Antrim.Originally four puppies were brought to the Ballymena Rehoming Centre by authorities, and were named Neo, Asher, April and Daffy by staff there. However, after receiving an initial vet check-up, they were found to have contracted parvovirus and despite best efforts by the team to help her, April sadly passed away. Conor O’Kane, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena said: “When they arrived, we could tell they had been through a traumatic experience and that something was wrong. We had them immediately checked over by a vet and after it was confirmed they had parvovirus they began treatment but unfortunately nothing could be done for April. “We believe they were under the age of eight weeks which is too young to be taken away from their mum or to undertake such signicant travel. After around four weeks of treatment, Asher, Daffy and Neo received a clean bill of health during that time, they had relaxed more and really started to come out of their shells. “It wasn’t long before we were able to find them new owners prepared to give them all the love and care they need to live happy lives, despite their dficult start in le.” Paula Boyden, Veterinary Director at Dogs Trust,said: “An ongoing and very serious issue that faces dogs and potential owners is the illegal trade of puppies. Alongside other animal welfare organisations in Northern Ireland, we have been campaigning for stronger and better enforcement of dog breeding regulations. “It is important that an improved, robust licensing system is developed in Northern Ireland in order to tackle unscrupulous breeders and sellers, alongside effective inspection of licenced breeders to ensure the welfare of dogs. As well as requiring every dog breeder to be registered or licensed, these credentials should be a legal requirement on any advertising that promotes the sale of dogs.” Every year puppies are illegally imported into Great Britain and mis-sold via online ads to unsuspecting dog lovers who think they are getting a healthy, happy home-bred puppy. Dogs Trust is urging potential dog owners to follow the charity’s responsible purchasing advice when getting a puppy:  Potential owners should always call the puppy seller beforehand and should never make any payment in advance of seeing or meeting their new pet  Pitfalls can be avoiding by not rushing into purchasing a puppy and following our buyer advice so potential dog owners aren’t ‘dogfished’. Always ask to see puppy and mum together at their home, evenits via video call to comply with coronavirus restrictions. Ask lots of questions and expect to be asked lots of questions as a good breeder will want to know where the puppy is going  All puppies should be microchipped at eight weeks old and registered to the breeder as the first keeper. Potential owners should be able to check whether paperwork such as pedigree papers, microchipping, proof of vet checks and vaccinations, all match  If, for whatever reason, something doesn’t feel right or you feel pressured into buying when you see or visit them, do not proceed and report to Trading Standards  We would recommend potential owners consider adopting a rescue dog before purchasing a puppy, howeveryou are planning on purchasing a puppy, then make sure you do your homework. Dogs Trust is changing the tale for dogs like Neo, Asher and Daffy.

Destinations include Portugal, Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.However, today’s poll reveals many are still deeply reluctant to hop on a plane abroad any time soon.People were asked, once vaccinated, when they would consider a foreign holiday.Just % said they plan to head away in  — % may travel this summer while another % would consider an overseas trip later in the year.The vast majority , said it would be next year before they think about going abroad.Another % said it would be two or three years before a trip outside the UK or Ireland, while % have no plans to go overseas at any point.The remaining % were unsure or had no firm opinion.Fewer older people are willing to consider overseas travel this year. Just % would consider doing so — % this summer and % at any point this year. More than halfsaid it would be next year before they consider jetting off, while % would leave it two or three years.By contrast, almost halfof  to  year olds are considering heading overseas this year — with % hoping to get away in the next few months and % later in the year. Another % will leave it to . Broken down by gender, males of any age are more willing to take a trip abroad — % plan to do so this summer and a further % will at some point in . Another % said it would be next year.However, just over a quarter of females plan to holiday abroad in  — % this summer and % this year. Some % plan to leave trips to .It comes as a public health expert from Belfast warned against summer holidays — despite the traffic light system for foreign travel.Professor Gabriel Scally told holidaymakers to “beware” and also warned it is “irresponsible” to travel to other countries while potentially infected with a dangerous iant.Prof Scally, a member of independent Sage, said: “The regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe issued a statement in the last couple of days saying there shouldn’t be international travel and I would agree with that.“It is undesirable to have people holidaying in international resorts at this time for all sorts of reasons.“It isn’t necessarily safe to travel on airplanes, there was a flight between India and Hong Kong and there were  infections and they were only picked up because of quarantine in Hong Kong.“Flights are dficult, but it isn’t just the flights, it’s what happens at arrivals and departures with queues of people in restricted spaces.“You also have lots of people from dferent countries mixing together at foreign resorts.“If you think back a year, the virus came to the UK and Republic of Ireland by people ing from holidays.”He continued: “It’s important to remember that the vaccine isn’t the cure all.“There’s always the risk posed by iants and it’s irresponsible to go off to another country and potentially take a dangerous iant with you.”Prof Scally also criticised the traffic light system, saying: “We need a proper managed quarantine system for everyone arriving into the country.”The Department of Health and the Executive were contacted for comment.Yesterday an airline industry chief said people who have received both doses of the Covid- vaccine should not face restrictions when travelling to countries on the Government’s amber list.Willie Walsh, director-general of airline body Iata, said people should be allowed to make up their own minds about the risks of travelling to amber list destinationsthey have received their jabs.Those ing from countries on the Government’s amber list must quarantine at home for  days and take pre-departure and post-arrival tests.But Mr Walsh, who is the former chief executive of IAG — the parent company of British Airways — said amber restrictions should be the same as those for green list countries for fully vaccinated passengers.He told the Mail on Sunday: “People were promised the benefit of being vaccinated — a vaccine idend — and they should be given it.“I thinkyou’ve had both shots then there’s no argument you can make to say those restrictions can remain in place, and people should be free to decide for themselvesthey see any risk in travelling to a green or amber country,” the former IAG chief executive added.Belfast Most

Credit: Liam McBurney PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people in Northern Ireland believe parents should have the right to refuse a Covid vaccine for their children, our poll shows.The news comes after Northern Ireland’s vaccine roll-out opened to those aged  to  and a raft of Covid restrictions are lted from Monday.“This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice,” Health Minister Robin Swann said.According to the Belfast -LucidTalk poll, % of respondents felt parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should not and % said they did not know, were not sure or had no opinion.The figures, however, y depending on the age and religious make-up of those who took part in the poll.Regarding  to  year-olds, a majorityfelt parents should not be able to turn down a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should and % didn’t know or had no opinion.Those aged  to , on the other hand, had starkly contrasting views. Some % said parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children and % said they should not. And % said they didn’t know, were unsure or had no opinion.Vaccines may be refused for a iety of reasons. For instance, earlier this year several countries temporarily halted the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab due to concerns of rare blood clots.Due to evidence suggesting that younger people may be at greater risk of the extremely rare clots associated with the AstaZeneca vaccine, those in this age group can choose which vaccine to receive.The latest advice states that anyone under  can book a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or they can make what the Department of Health has described as an “informed decision” and get the AstraZeneca jab at Belfast’s SSE Arena or at participating community pharmacies.More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine to date.Looking at the religious make-up of those who took part in the poll, it is apparent that Protestants are more likely to feel parents should have a say over vaccinating their children than when compared to Catholics.Some % of Protestant respondents felt this way, while % felt they should not have the right to turn down a jab for their children and % had no opinion, were not sure or didn’t know.Of those designating as Catholic, % felt they should have the right to turn down a vaccine for their children and % did not. The remaining % said they didn’t know or were unsure.In terms of those of no religion, % were in favour of parents having this right and % did not. Some % weren’t sure or had no opinion on the matter.On Sunday the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “A Public Health England study has found the vaccines are highly effective. This underlines the need for people to come forward for their first and second doses as soon as they are available.”Belfast Most ReadMark Allen goes from black to red: Snooker star declared bankruptAlarm as motorist drives on wrong side of Belfast to Newry A carriagewayRetired cop targeted by New IRAAllison MorrisOpinionArlene Foster could have the last laughDUP poll slide continuesPiers Morgan offers to bury hatchet with Van Morrison over Irish coffees in BelfastTop VideosPlayIndoor eating and drinking begins again across Northern Ireland\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPoll puts the DUP on just %PlayPolice revisit scene of west Belfast hit and runLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageYour questions about the new rules on travelling answered as Covid restrictions ease Smiles are back in Derry after the dark days of CovidNorthern Ireland hospitality trade welcomes customers indoors againPoll: % of Northern Ireland people plan holiday abroadLatestMaureen ColemanOpinionEurovision Song Contest disaster: can the UK recover from its nul points nightmare  In Pictures: Kate and William get cooking in ScotlandLabour MP accuses Jeremy Corbyn of failure to declare full legal fundingWeinstein extradition to Calornia hit by another delayTimothee Chalamet to play young Willy Wonka in origins film,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You could be forgiven for thinking officials want to make travel as dficult as possible.At the same time, the UK and the Republic of Ireland have two dferent traffic light lists which are constantly in flux, depending on the changing landscape in dferent countries around the world.For example, currently anyone flying into the Republic of Ireland from Canada or the US has to stay in managed quarantine, whereas anyone arriving into England from both countries only has to isolate at home for -days.There’s no obvious reason for the disparity and it certainly adds to the whole confusion around foreign travel and what is and isn’t safe.The desire for some summer sun after a long, miserable lockdown in Northern Ireland is understandable — but a holiday is even more of a necessity after trying to navigate the rules and advice relating to travel during a pandemic..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadMark Allen goes from black to red: Snooker star declared bankruptAlarm as motorist drives on wrong side of Belfast to Newry A carriagewayRetired cop targeted by New IRAAllison MorrisOpinionArlene Foster could have the last laughDUP poll slide continuesElements of UDA ready to abandon ‘farcical’ LCCTop VideosPlayIndoor eating and drinking begins again across Northern Ireland\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPoll puts the DUP on just %PlayPolice revisit scene of west Belfast hit and runLatest Northern IrelandTime to get on with rebuilding our economy – O’NeillMinister sees ‘no substantive reason’ for Storey funeral inquiryPoor signage played a role in the death of GAA player Karl Heaney killed in car crash, court toldRed carpet rolled out for Foster and O’Neill in east BelfastCome dine with me… delight on the streets of Belfast as indoor hospitality reopens after five monthsLatestMaureen ColemanOpinionEurovision Song Contest disaster: can the UK recover from its nul points nightmare  Labour MP accuses Jeremy Corbyn of failure to declare full legal fundingWeinstein extradition to Calornia hit by another delayTimothee Chalamet to play young Willy Wonka in origins filmRaab points finger at Russia over Belarus ‘hijack’ and arrest of journalist,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The party has fallen % from our January poll, but remains just ahead of its .%  Assembly election result.Extensive rebuilding work in the last few years appears unable to entice new voters, but the party continues to maintain its loyal base.The Greens, People Before Profit and others and independents all sit on % of the vote.

I’ve just gone through your As Darragh Did donations and I’m overwhelmed by your support,” he said. Read MoreDoctors wanted Deirdre Morley to be admitted to psychiatric hospital two months before tragedy but she refusedAndrew McGinley: ‘What drives me is keeping my children’s legacy alive... their lives were so short’“Hopefully I will have responded to you all this week to thank you inidually. Can’t type for tears at the moment. Thank you.”The charity was set up in memory of his son Darragh, who was involved in a number of local activities, such as Rathcoole Boys, St Marys GAA in Saggart and Commercials Hurling.His other son Conor always wanted to have a YouTube channel. As such, Mr McGinley set up Conor’s Clips on YouTube to let his children’s memory live on.His daughter Carla wanted a snowman, but as it doesn’t snow every year in Ireland, he organised a colouring competition in her name with Snowman for Carla.Meanwhile, Mr McGinley said today that he has “no doubt” had he been included in Ms Morley#s therapy as an advocate, his children would still be alive today.“After Christmas , and early in January , the family and the support circle - and we had a huge support circle - we were all of the opinion that Dee was improving,” he said on Newstalk Breakfast this morning.“She was even talking about going back to work. So we thought she was on an upward move, and that she was improving.Whilst it came out in court that the mental services that were treating her thought she was in decline.“And there’s also, within the trial, a decision that was left to Dee at that time, where they are saying that her health is deteriorating with the, I would say the knowledge, that her thought process and her decision making may have been impacted by her illness.”He also said that while he believes families should be included in mental health proceedings, ultimately the patient would still have the final say.“If you were painting your kitchen you would probably turn around to say to somebody : ‘what do you think ’ You would seek advice,” Mr McGinley said.“Now whether Deidre would have taken my advice, it’s not to say. Ultimately the decision would have been up to her. But I would hope that the professional services that were treating her would know that what is best for the patient.“I think in this case, at Christmas , they put a question to Dee about being readmitted. So in their opinion, they thought that was the best thing to do. They recognised that her health is deteriorating, and yet we on the other side are thinking that she is improving. It’s hard to understand for people.”He added that: “Quite simply,the mental health services would have contacted me and said: ‘Listen, I’m just wondering after the consultation, what did Deidre say to you ’ And I could have said: ‘She said A, B, and C’. And they could have went, “Oh, well actually she should have said X, Y, and Z’.“It’s including and asking questions, and gaining knowledge. That’s really what they should be doing.”Mr McGinley said he’s doing “alright” following the trial of Ms Morley.For now, his focus is on ious projects which keep the memory of his children alive.If you have been affected by any of the issues in this piece, please free phone the Samaritans at  ..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Independent.ieMost ReadMark Allen goes from black to red: Snooker star declared bankruptAlarm as motorist drives on wrong side of Belfast to Newry A carriagewayRetired cop targeted by New IRAAllison MorrisOpinionArlene Foster could have the last laughDUP poll slide continuesPiers Morgan offers to bury hatchet with Van Morrison over Irish coffees in BelfastTop VideosPlayIndoor eating and drinking begins again across Northern Ireland\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPoll puts the DUP on just %PlayVideo: Searching for Taylor Swt in Belfast Latest Republic of IrelandRaab points finger at Russia over Belarus ‘hijack’ and arrest of journalistPilot live events to begin next month, Culture Minister confirmsNI political leaders to contact Taoiseach over lack of engagement on Covid-Pilots call for antigen testing to speed up reopening of international travelForced landing of Ryanair flight ‘state-sponsored coercive act’LatestMaureen ColemanOpinionEurovision Song Contest disaster: can the UK recover from its nul points nightmare  David Ellefson leaves Megadeth following sexual misconduct allegationsIn Pictures: Kate and William get cooking in ScotlandLabour MP accuses Jeremy Corbyn of failure to declare full legal fundingWeinstein extradition to Calornia hit by another delay,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The esteemed Man United left back and England international, has congratulated -year-old Ainara on her winning entry in the Ulster University and Manchester United Foundation competition. The two organisations have worked in partnership together since , but this is the first competition of its kind. With a full-time Foundation officer based at the university’s Magee campus, the partnership focusses on delivering positive outcomes by providing experiences and opportunities for young people across the Foyle Learning Community. googletag.cmd.push Ainara’s prize included two tickets plus travel to watch a Manchester United game - once normal spectator matches are able to resume. Runners-up will receive Manchester United goody bags. In order to win this prize Ainara and other post primary students from the Foyle Learning Community were challenged to research, design and map financing for a product, which could be sold in the Manchester United Megastore. Ainara came up with the clever concept of a mini, portable projector, which could be plugged into a phone, providing the user with the ability to watch a football match anywhere from the back garden to the local park. googletag.cmd.push The concept was especially apt given that friends can’t currently meet indoors to watch the game together. The students’ ideas were presented to a  of judges who picked Ainara’s innovative product design as the winner. Speaking after learning the news,Ainara said she cannot wait to see all the players. I have never been to a proper football match before so I am really looking forward to it. I love being part of Manchester United Foundation and joining in with all the projects,” she added. Malachy O’Neill, Ulster University Provost, Magee Campus, congratulated the young Derry girl on winning the inaugural competition.     He said: We’re thrilled to have the Foundation hub now up and running at our Magee campus and look forward to creating many more exciting opportunities for the pupils in our partner schools across the city and beyond.” John Shiels, Manchester United Foundation CEO, added: “Congratulations Ainara on winning our first ever Ulster University Foundation competition. I really look forward to welcoming you to Manchester and to Old Trafford. With the innovation of your winning product, you have set really high standards. It is the aspiration of this partnership to engage and inspire many others to follow you by getting them to participate in the many programmes and projects we intend to offer in the future”. Meanwhile, Matthew Lewsley, the Foundation’s school partnership officer at Ulster University, expressed his delight to be working within Schools Outreach at Ulster University to deliver projects and engage with young people across the Foyle Learning Community in Derry. We are really looking forward to providing further opportunities in order to enrich our school’s outreach and development across Northern Ireland.” WATCH: Luke Shaw announcing the winner:https:www.youtube watch vZsocyovVY  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Back when I was a teenager, my mother and I were desperately poor. I’m talking about no money for food, no money for heating, sleeping in a sleeping bag under the covers with multiple jumpers on poor. googletag.cmd.push A combination of my mother’s pride and my father’s selfishness created a situation where I lived in a wealthy part of town but went hungry every day for many years. I was also badly bullied but my school did nothing about it, despite it being clear what was happening. Anyway, during this time, three things saved me. One was a teacher involved in the library and other library staff who allowed me to be in there when I really shouldn’t have been. They let me be myself and kept me safe. Years later I had the chance to express my thanks to the we of this lovely teacher with tears in my eyes. googletag.cmd.push She told me many people felt that way about his kindness and she was glad I found a safe space thanks to him and the other staff. Second was the VP, a formidable woman whom few dared to cross. She spotted how thin I was, how my unorm wasn’t the cleanest and was shabby and threadbare in places. She brought me into her office, asked some questions about my mother’s income and gave me forms to complete so I could get free school meals. She knew by my face that I didn’t feel safe ulging the information to her so she told meI had to, steal the information I needed, bring her the forms and she’d post them for me.     She showed me unbelievable kindness that day and thanks to her, I had one decent meal a day from then on. It was often the only time I ate in any given day. Thirdly, a wonderful, funny, joyous and kind woman who worked in the canteen would pile my plate up each day and sneak me extra desserts. On Fridays she’d stuff my pockets with whatever sealed food she could, risking the ire of thecanteen manager and quite possibly her job but thanks to her, I had food I could eat at the weekends. She lived nearby and every time I passed her house, even to this day, I think of her and give thanks for her fierceness and kindness to me. So thank you to JT, MT and PB for helping me through some of the toughest and dficult years of my le. You won’t remember me but I give thanks to you all more often than you’d realise.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The seven-acre site at Bay Road faces onto the River Foyle. The site has long been used as a fuel depot. However, last year a large number of people put their name to a petition objecting to a bid for a coal screening operation on the site. The site has now been placed on the market. Although zoned as ‘white land’ the fuel yard could have development potential, particularly with the progress on the nearby Fort George site. The Department for Communities decision to sell part of the site to the Western Trust in March marked the latest step in the ambitious project. googletag.cmd.push The land on the river front of the Bay Road coal yard was also recently acquired for the new cross border cycle network, which will include a new pedestrian and cycle bridge across the Pennyburn Inlet. The sale of the Bay Road site is being managed by TDK Commerical Property Consultants. In the sales brochure, it states: “The site measures approx. . acresand was previously used as a coal storage and distribution yard. The site benefits from  large warehouses, office building and a large covered storage area. “It has roughly  m of frontage on-to the River Foyle and this could be extended up the Pennyburn Inlet by around m.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry News has learned that Home Bargains is keen on opening a new outlet on the large Waterside site. The Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre site was put up for sale last year by its owners Derry City and Strabane District Council with an asking price of pound,. It is understood that there was strong interest in the site from potential buyers. However, the council has confirmed that a preferred bidder has been approved by the councils Business and Culture Committee. That decision will now need to be ratied at the councils full monthly meeting later this month before the final details of the sale can be processed. googletag.cmd.push While all those involved in the sale of the key Waterside site are remaining tight-lipped, the Derry News understands that the preferred bidder would see Home Bargains opening a new store on the site. This would involve the demolition of the former leisure centre building and the construction of the new store. The Derry News contacted Home Bargains, who already have a store at Strand Road in Derry, about their plans for further expansion in the city. However, a spokesperson for the company said they were not able to comment at this time. A spokesperson for the local council said a report was brought before the Business and Culture Committee last week in confidential business seeking members approval for the appointment of the preferred bidder for the purchase and development of the Lisnagelvin site. googletag.cmd.push “This decision will come before Full Council for full ratication at the end of the month,” the spokesperson said. “Once ratied Councils legal services team will engage with the successful bidder to commence legal formalities for the disposal and development of the site in accordance with the Conditions of Sale set out in the tender documents.” ​Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre closed several years ago. The leisure centre was hugely popular with generations of young people in the city, especially because of its swimming pool and its famous wave machine. Since being closed, the building has been empty and there has been much debate about the future use of the large site.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A wide range of sectors, including pubs, restaurants and hotels, can fully reopen from today. Pubs with outdoor spaces have been allowed to serve outside for several weeks. However, today is the key date that most local businesses have been looking forward to. Dawn McLaughlin, President of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, urged people to remain vigilant against Covid, but said it was a great day for the economy. “We have been consistent in our message that we aren’t fully open until we’re all open,” she said. googletag.cmd.push The high street and city centre businesses are reliant on each other to thrive so it is great news that indoor hospitality and other indoor businesses like cinemas will be allowed to reopen. “We can now begin to look towards the busy summer period and our economic recovery.” However, she added that there remains some ambiguity and grey areas within the hospitality industry over what is exactly required of them to reopen. “It’s important that the relevant authorities take a lenient and educational approach which supports our hospitality businesses and doesn’t punish them any further, especially as many of them have invested time and money in making their premises Covid-secure. googletag.cmd.push “These latest relaxations coupled with the continued success of the vaccine programme bring a real sense of optimism and positivity for the coming weeks and months. “Businesses are excited to reopen and welcome back customers and we would urge people to stay, shop and support local as they get back out and about. “It’s also crucial that we continue to follow the basics of mask wearing, hand washing, good ventilation, and social distancing to keep cases down and ensure the economy isn’t restricted again.” Cases rate fallen Meanwhile, the rate of Covid cases in Derrys council area has fallen in the past seven days – but remains the highest in Northern Ireland.

That was the last we heard from him.ldquoI was listening to the news all afternoon to hearthere was anything happening. It wasnrsquot until pm that night when I was listening to the RTE news that I heard a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.Mr Mullan knew in his gut that it was his brother, but could not bring himself to tell his parents, John and Mary.ldquoAll that was said that he was shot, it didnrsquot say he was dead. He was actually dead within  minutes of being shot, he continued.ldquoWe were phoned around am and I found out he was dead. I called the doctor just in case my mother would get badly upset and she was badly upset after the doctor told her. I couldnrsquot bring myself to tell her.ldquoMy father was up the stairs and couldnrsquot come down the stairs but he knew it was bad news.Mr Mullan said it took the Ballymurphy families a few years to organise in order to campaign for truth and justice as a  inquest recorded an open verdict in all the deaths.He has been involved with the campaign for a new inquest for over  years, travelling to Dublin and Brussels and beyond on order to plead the familiesrsquo case.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan and son Hugh had been regular attenders over the  days the inquest was held.The family, including Mr Mullanrsquos late sister Teresa, lived for a time on the Strand, beside the Portaferry Hotel.While Mr Mulllan took after his father and spent his working le fishing, Fr Mullan spent a year in the Merchant Navy before opting to go to Queenrsquos University and then Maynooth College to train to be a priest.He served for a time at St Josephrsquos Church in Killough before moving to Dunloy for nine years. While his funeral was held in Belfast, he was buried in St Patrickrsquos graveyard in Portaferry.ldquoHugh baptised all my family, he married me and my we Mary, so he was very close to us all, said Mr Mullan.He recalled how his brother loved to sail in Strangford Lough and entertain his family or parishioners by singing along to his guitar.But most of all, Mr Mullan mourns what his brother could have done for others.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who needed to be among people all the time, helping people, he said.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny. He particularly liked to help young people and loved working and encouraging them.ldquoIf he had have got a chance in Ballymurphy, he would have helped the people no end to help themselves. Thatrsquos what he aimed to do with people and was always thinking of dferent things that he could start.Mr Mullan thanked everybody who had called him or send cards over the week and in particular, local priest, Fr Feargal McGrady, for his help and support over the years.Mr Mullanrsquos granddaughter, Mairead OrsquoHare, added: ldquoThese families have fought so tirelessly over the years to get justice for their loved ones, it has been both inspiring and heartbreaking to watch.ldquoI never met my great-uncle, but the stories my Granda tells regularly make his presence known and you can easily tell that the love my Granda has for his brother has never ceased.ldquoHe has known for the last  years that his brother was innocent, he didnrsquot need a coronerrsquos ruling to know that, but having Fr Mullan declared innocent to the entire world has brought much needed comfort and peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-World.jpg","title":"‘World knows Hugh was innocent’  ","story":"THE family of Ballymurphy Massacre victim Fr Hugh Mullan have welcomed a coronerrsquos ruling that he was an innocent ldquopeacemaker.The Portaferry priest was shot dead by soldiers as he tended to a wounded man on waste ground in west Belfast on August  .Fr Mullan and nine others shot dead were all exonerated in an inquest ruling by a coroner last week.At the time the Army reported that the nine men and one woman who died were Republican gunmen killed in crossfire.The first to die over the three days of shooting, Fr Mullan had only served a a church for seven months.Mrs Justice Keegan said in her findings that he was ldquounarmed, not acting in any way as a threat, attending to a wounded man in the field and waving a white object as a sign of his peaceful intentions.ldquoHe died as a result of gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen. The shooting of the deceased has not been justied by the State.

This means that plastic litter in the sea is just adding up and, globally, we are adding a truck load full every minute, she continued.ldquoThat is a lot of plastic and, on top of looking bad, it is harmful to sea plants and animals. Every year, plastic kills , sea animals and over a million sea birds. It is a big problem.During last weekrsquos launch event in Ardglass, a number of fishermen told Jenny how sad they were to see how much litter is in the sea and that they have noticed an increase in the amount of it in during their letimes.ldquoIt also takes their valuable time at sea to clear from their nets and can potentially contaminate their catch, so the new scheme is a win-win for them to do their part in getting rid of it.Describing the new project as ldquoinnovative, Jenny said it has already been successful where with fishermen bringing marine litter caught in their nets back to shore.She said the Harbour Authority provides durable bags for the litter to be collected in and that once landed onshore, it is sent off to be recycled or otherwise disposed of.ldquoThis is how our fishermen in Northern Ireland are reducing the marine plastic problem at sea, Jenny explained. ldquoThe thing that makes this project so unique is that fishermen are almost the only people who have access to litter that is out in the open water or at the seabed.ldquoStopping waste entering the sea is imperative, but taking litter out of the sea is too, even though it is more challenging. That is exactly what lsquofishing for litterrsquo fishermen do.Jenny praised the fishermen in Ardglass who have signed up to the scheme as did local councillor, Dermot Curran.ldquoThis is a great scheme and anything which can help reduce the amount of marine litter being washed ashore is to be welcomed, he said.ldquoTen Ardglass skippers have already signed up for the scheme and I hope that there will be more. This is a great new initiative but we also have to look at how litter gets into the sea in the first place which poses problems for trawler skippers as this waste gets tangled up in their nest which is time-consuming and a distraction they could well do without, he said.ldquoThe Fishery Harbour Authority is to be congratulated for bringing this initiative to the Co Down ports and the more skippers that sign up for lsquofishing for litterrsquo the better. The scheme can help protect the environment and reduce the amount of unsightly litter being washed up along the shoreline..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business support programme helps secure 78 jobs in district  ","story":"A COUNCIL-LED local business support programme has created  jobs in the last  months.According to new figures released, the Business Growth and Tender for Growth programmes facilitated by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council have helped to create an average of one new job each week.The programmes are part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Despite the impact of recent lockdowns over the last  months, NMD Business has continued to provide SMEs with support packages in response to challenges created by the pandemic.This has resulted in ongoing growth for the business and the creation of  new job roles, as well as helping  businesses involved in the programme to navigate an unprecedented economic environment.Participants in the programme are able to avail of one-to-one mentoring from leading experts, who help guide them and their business through unprecedented times, as well as learning new skills in financial management, cross-border sales and maximising your chances of winning tenders.As a result, many businesses have been able to not only grow their business, but grow their workforce.Sara Velasquez, from Ecoplastic in Downpatrick, completed the programme last year and has already recruited four new staff for the business.Her firm designs and makes all kinds of structures from % recycled material, from boardwalks to street furniture, bridges to bike trails and picnic tables.She said: ldquoThe NMD Business programme helped us focus on the most lucrative areas for growth for our business.ldquoOur dedicated mentor provided us with expert guidance which allowed us to respond quickly to a new market environment, giving us confidence that decisions we were taking were anchored in good commercial sense, while the workshops equipped us with new skills that will stand us in good stead into the future.ldquoSales have since increased as a result and we continue to work on exciting projects across Ireland and the UK.

They have been allowed to continue for too long.ldquoPotentially using body cams and CCTV to apprehend offenders is welcome but, as I have consistently argued, there is a need to beef up existing legislation and work alongside other bodies to examine how they have successfully dealt with the problem.The politician said everyone had a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure their rubbish doesnrsquot end up being illegally dumped and to clean up after their pets.ldquoThere is simply no excuse for not doing so, Cllr Walker declared. ldquoWhile most people dispose of their waste properly and clean the mess that their pets create, there are many who donrsquot, caring little for the environment, the districtrsquos appearance or the cost of cleaning up after them. We need affirmative action so those who blatantly disregard the law are made accountable.Cllr Walker said dog dirt posed a major health risk to children who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.He added: ldquoWhile the council has been told that the DNA testing of dog dirt is not feasible as the local authority has no legal power to insist that dog owners register for the service, we still have to get to grips with this issue.ldquoThe enforcement improvement plan is welcome, but it would be so much easier of dog owners cleaned up after their pets.

It was a four-lap course which started at Greenisland Golf Club and carried on via Monkstown Wood, Shore Road and then a bit of a challenge with a hill to contend with on Station Road.The weather was grey with a little drizzle but nothing to cause major problems and in fact Declan felt that there was a slight wind assistance on the climb which was welcome.The overall winner Chris Denton, was the only runner to break three hours and he took top spot on the podium with a time of two hours and  minutes.Declan was more than happy with his own time of . and the fact that he placed seventh overall.

This is especially true of local access to emergency care.Mr Hazzard said many were acutely aware that the Department of Health will soon launch a review of urgent and emergency care, suggesting that given the soundings to date from both health minister Robin Swann and the South Eastern Trust, there will be concern across the community that this will have ldquomajor ramications for the delivery of emergency medicine in small rural hospitals like the Downe.ldquoWith this in mind, it is vital that our local community and health workers are afforded an opportunity to be proactively involved in determining the most appropriate model of healthcare at the Downe, the MP declared.ldquoI was encouraged to hear the health trust recognise that communication and dialogue need to improve in the time ahead and that elected representatives, trade unions and community health activists can play a constructive role in partnership with officials in delivering for the Downe.Mr Hazzard said this would not only enable the local community to benefit from regular public engagement and consultation but, perhaps most importantly, would ensure a real andmeaningful process of co-design with staff and their trade union representatives.He added: ldquoI look forward to hearing back from the South Eastern Trust in the weeks ahead as to how this partnership forum can be established and will once again endeavour to work in partnership with all local political parties, staff representatives, and the Down Community Health Committee.News of the proposal for the establishment of the new health forum involving the public and health workers comes after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to involve local health campaigners in a a major new offensive to ensure that the Downpatrick hospital continues to deliver key services.In April, politicians paved the way for the Down Community Heath Committee to join them in key discussions about the future of the Downpatrick hospital which they say has a critical role to play in delivering key services for people across the South Eastern Trust area in a post-Covid world..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Hurlers.jpg","title":"Hurlers rally to win over Carlow  ","story":"DOWN hurlers showed they still have plenty to fight for after they secured a rallying comeback win inspired by their talisman Paul Sheehan against Carlow.Following last weekendrsquos defeat to Kerry, Ronan Sheehanrsquos men knew they had to put on a show at Ballycran in order to avoid an early indication of relegation.The contest was worthy of a crowd, as the action-packed affair exploded from the first whistle when Carlowrsquos Kevin McDonald put his side a goal up within the opening minute.The away side piled on relentless pressure to inflict further damage on the Down side as the points gap began to widen.However, as per the usual story, star man Sheehan began picking up the pieces and alongside Caolan Taggart and Daithi Sands, Down began to let Carlow know they werenrsquot here to just fill up the numbers.The away team lost their goal advantage on the half-hour mark when the ever dangerous Conor Woods cracked home a thumping penalty to tie the scores.Sheehan ensured Down entered the half-time break on top, scoring three points in two minutes to help his side lead -

There will also be increased emphasis on ensuring that public toilets meet the needs of those with autism, dementia and other health conditions.The new toilet strategy mdash which includes a review of how council-owned toilets are managed, cleaned and maintained mdash is expected to be formally signed off at tonightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Across the district, the local authority is responsible for  public conveniences, many of which have been in place for over  years and are showing signs of corrosion and internal wear and tear. A number have also been vandalised.Councillors will be told tonight that a decision is required to repair, replace or remove these particular units and they will be provided with a detailed breakdown of the work that is required.Toilets at Castlewellanrsquos Upper Square need to be replaced while the outer shell of the building would remain in place, while the existing facility at Market Street in Downpatrick would be entirely replaced.The new strategy suggests that the current public toilets at The Rocks in Ballyhornan would be replaced as would existing toilets at the local authority-owned car park at the Newcastle Road outside Dundrum.Plans have also been drawn up to replace toilets at Crossgarrsquos Lislea Drive and at Ardglass harbour, while public toilets at the New Line in Saintfield mdash which have been repeatedly targeted by vandals mdash would replaced, alongside those at the Quoile Road in Downpatrick.Public toilets the Lough Inch cemetery in Ballynahinch and Struell Cemetery in Downpatrick are also in line for refurbishment under the new council strategy, alongside conveniences at Windmill Street in Ballynahinch.It will also be confirmed at tonightrsquos council meeting that almost  people responded to a -week consultation on the new strategy with over  percent of those who responded agreeing with the suggestion to pay to spend a penny. Concern was also expressed about the cleanliness of some public toilets and their layout.And while council toilets in Newcastle, Dundrum, Castlewellan, Downpatrick, Ballyhornan and Ardglass have reopened after being closed due to coronavirus, those in Saintfield, Ballynahinch, Crossgar and Killyleagh remain closed. They are due to reopen shortly.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to reopen council toilets across the Rowallane area and said the fact that these particular public conveniences have been closed or over a year was ldquounacceptable.He said steps should have been taken earlier to ensure that staff were available to open and maintain the ious facilities.Cllr Walker was particularly critical of the decision to keep toilets in Killyleagh closed given the number of people who visited the town over recent months as Covid restrictions eased.ldquoPublic toilets across the Rowallane area were closed too long for my liking and I am aware that there was concern that conveniences at the townrsquos Market House and nearby community centre were also closed, he continued.ldquoI have been informed that all public toilets across the district will be reopened by June and that is welcome news.

It is celebrated on Sunday, May .In their joint message, the bishops opened by quoting a verse from the book of Acts in the Bible: \"All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability - Acts :.\"They continued: \"One of the great marks of the first Pentecost was the ability the Holy Spirit gave the apostles to speak across barriers of language of the works of God.ldquoThe Spirit today gives the people of God the same ability to speak as one across all kinds of barriers and boundaries.ldquoWe rejoice today that we can speak together to both our church communities and beyond with a common message of hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"Stating their disappointment that for a second year they are unable to mark this \"great feast\" by coming together for their Ecumenical Service of Prayer, as they have done for almost  years, the bishops added: \"This service allows us to give thanks and praise together to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Please God, next year this might again be possible.\"They continued their message by noting how speaking together about \"the goodness of God\" across barriers is an \"important expression of the language of hope\".They said: \"This is so important as we begin the journey of recovery from the impact of coronavirus. There has been much suffering the loss of loved ones, illness, financial challenge and isolation.ldquoWe all need to hear the healing and strengthening words of Christ, lsquoCome unto me all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you restrsquo.\"Outlining how during the pandemic people quickly realised how important communication is when denied simple non-verbal qualities of close contact and touch, the bishops said: \"We discovered how much we need the warmth of the love of our family and friends.ldquoThe telephone and internet became our key means of keeping in touch and we thank God for these technological aids that kept us connected.ldquoCrucially, we learned how much we are indebted to medical staff, nurses, key workers and volunteers who have communicated dedication, care and love to the community through their skill and acts of kindness.\"We must continue to communicate the language of love and hope across all barriers and boundaries.ldquoIt would be so easy after this long period of restrictions to move to despair and lose hope. Yet we believe there are signs of new le all around us in the vaccination programme and the good response to public health guidance.ldquoLet us encourage one another to communicate the hope that by Godrsquos help, our common le will slowly , and together seek his grace to renew our lives.\"In closing, the bishops said: \"We pray that the Holy Spirit of Pentecost may inspire us so that we communicate in our words and deeds the hope we have in God.ldquoMay we as Christian people speak of our belief in the transforming power of God, and by his Spirit to work together for the rebuilding and re-energising of our churches and society.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How he identies is what should have been the central focus of unionism in the last century: the idea of dual identity.

If Ulster is, to coin a phrase, to be as British as Finchley, then unionists must work to create a society in which Irish identiers can say they are British.Instead of looking for dferences in the Province, we must look for commonality across these ancient islands. That will be our basis to breakdown barriers and create a stronger British nation for all our people.

I haven’t had the opportunity to speak with Edwin yet but I’m sure, when I do, we’ll discuss all of those matters,” she said.“He hasn’t been speaking to me as yet and actually I still have yet to see the letter, so-called, and I’m beginning to wonder is there a letter at all, but in any event I look forward to seeing the letter and I look forward to having that conversation whenever Edwin reaches out.Mrs Foster said the letter “was supposed to be signed by  of my colleagues”.“Some of my colleagues are indicating they were told they were number , even though a number of them had been told that, so I would quite like to see the letter just from my own point of view to see what’s in it, and to see what was told to my colleagues,” she said.“It’s now been nearly four weeks since I heard about it and I still haven’t seen it.”Frontbench DUP MLA and Stormont Economy Minister Diane Dodds earlier said she hoped the party could heal itself following the leadership election.Mr Poots has said he plans to hold one-on-one meetings with MLAs and will later announce his ministerial team – including who will be first minister, having ruled himself out, saying he would prefer to concentrate on leading the DUP.Asked whether she had had her meeting with Mr Poots, Mrs Dodds said she had spoken to him.“I obviously have spoken to Edwin, that is critical for the way forward for the party,” she told media as she visited the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast.“I hope that the party can heal itself and to move forward, because the most important thing that the party can do from now on is to ensure that we attract the greatest and widest proportion of those people who are pro-union voters, those people who are concerned about the economy and who know that we have the policies, and the drive and the energy to make Northern Ireland a great place to live, to work and to do business.”Earlier, Mrs Dodds told the BBC there was a “huge job of work to do” for Mr Poots.Asked whether she felt he was the person to do the job, she responded: “The party takes a democratic decision and therefore that is the decision, and that is the position that we have arrived at.“I have made it very clear that the way forward for the party, and indeed the way forward for unionism in general, is to be as inclusive as it can possibly be to ensure that we are attracting pro-union voters to the cause of the DUP but generally to the cause of the union, and we will do that by being inclusive and being open-minded on the values and the importance of the union to Northern Ireland.”Asked whether she thought she would still be Stormont Economy Minister next Thursday, Mrs Dodds said: “I am not going to allow any of that to spoil my breakfast this morning in such a wonderful setting as the Grand Central Hotel, as for now, I am continuing to do my job as the Economy Minister.”  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularAlex Kane: Unionism may well be heading towards a new schismBad grammar in a unionist leader could be seen by political rivals as weaknessAllister turns question on speeding into Bobby Storey funeral barbJustice Minister Naomi Long condemns show of strength for th anniversary of hunger striker Patsy O’Hara’s death with ‘no care whatsoever for what could have been potentially tragic consequences’Ex-DUP MLA Brenda Hale will stay in party as ‘a critical friend’ after slamming removal of Arlene FosterMost Popular‘I reached out to God while sleeping in a half-dug Afghan grave’Jamie Bryson enlists former attorney general John Larkin as he prepares legal challenge to trial without juryPSNI District Commander issues major appeal on ‘brazen’ paramilitary show of strength after social media backlashDevastation after NI house fire claims le of one man and leaves another ‘critically ill’ -

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have broadened our option subjects at KS - we are now able to offer Construction, Health and Social Care and Textiles and Fashion.ldquoWe are committed to the promotion of SRG as a learning organisation. To this end we have entered into an ITE Partnership with Cardf politan University and an alliance with St.Illtydrsquos Catholic Comprehensive in Cardf. It is mutually beneficial since we help develop new teachers into the profession and we are able to utilise educational research to improve standards across both key stages.The Catholic school strives to ensures pupils succeed, while also being good people.ldquoWe aim for our pupils to live by the ethos of our pupil profile which is about virtues to empower them to be a success in le, added Mr Blackwell.ldquoWe are the faith secondary school of the Vale and so provide an excellent secondary education that runs equally alongside our holistic development of our pupils as iniduals and good all round people.The Catholic ethos is embedded into daily le at the school, with morning prayer, virtues-based assemblies, and daily reflection.ldquoAll staff engage in role modelling behaviour that reflects the Catholic virtues of honesty, integrity and forgiveness, added Mr Blackwell.ldquoDuring normal school times Mass is a frequent part of our school le ndash not all pupils come to us with a faith background, but they all appreciate the values that we try to weave into our everyday lives.Along with the schoolrsquos ethical focus St Richard Gwyn Catholic High School has an abundance of extra-curricular activities on offer, including school trips.Sporty youngsters can take part in football, rugby, netball, hockey, tennis, badminton, athletics, cheerleading and street dance. Therersquos also Clwb Cymraeg and an array of creative activities on offer ndash including art club, textiles club, choir, SRG band.Bi-annually the music, drama, and art departments join forces to produce and perform an arts production.St Richard Gwyn Catholic High School strives to form lsquopositive relationshipsrsquo with families and the local community and has a Facebook group regularly updated with video messages from Mr Blackwell and key messages for families.Each year group has a Progress Leader who is a point of contact for families as well as our Wellbeing and Progress Centre who liaises with families on a regular basis. Plus, St Richard Gwyn Catholic High School is in the process of obtaining the Investors in Families , which ndash in a nutshell ndash lsquois a quality mark that recognises the work that schools and other settings undertake with families to improve outcomes for children and young people.rsquoThe school is also lsquoproudrsquo to have worked with numerous charities ndash including fundraising for local food banks and helping Keep Wales Tidy with beach cleans.The school has also adapted a lsquogreatrsquo deal during the coronavirus pandemic ndash with the immediate priority being health and safety such as year group lsquobubblesrsquo, separate lunches, allocated outdoor spaces, regular sanitizing and face coverings.ldquoThe biggest impact, in terms of day to day operation, meant teachers moved more between lessons than students, said Mr Blackwell.ldquoCrucial to adapting to the pandemic was to adoption of online learning. There have been periods of lockdown with no pupils in school as well as fortnightly periods that have required year groups to isolate.He praised the training and use of online s as lsquotransformativersquo. and added that - while itrsquos lsquofantasticrsquo to resume in-person learning these changes and developments will continue to improve how the school operates.The school is lsquovery fortunatersquo to have been supported by the local authority to make the best of the buildings they have, but the school is awaiting progress on a new build under the st Century schools programme, financed by Welsh Government.ldquoWe firmly believe that what goes on inside school is more important than the way the building looks externally, said Mr Blackwell.ldquoWe have amazing staff who work exceptionally hard to make the best of the facilities we have, all pupils who come to us get a great educational experience.ldquoHowever, we are still awaiting progress on a new build. We will continue to work hard to improve our facilities with the support of our Governors and the local authority, but at the same time we will continue to lobby to get the new build progressed as soon as possible so that our pupils not only get a fantastic experience, but they also get it in state-of-the-art facilities they deserve. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
